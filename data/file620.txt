6200001 nuevamente el ministerio del interior no actu y luis alva castro desapareci no dijo una palabra y tampoco hubo protecci n policial quien sali fue el ministro de defensa ntero flores ar oz que nada tiene que ver en el asunto adem s han retenido polic as es una cosa incre ble lo que est sucediendo a nivel de gobierno

6200012 the committee will meet in early september and all the issues will be discussed my job as chairman is to facilitate discussion we will have to wait and see
6200013 it is however vital that the clock is not turned back to the situation before 1969 when the police were seen to be subject to the direction of the minister of home affairs
6200014 it would be a daunting role one would have to understand the machinations of the police the prison service the public prosecution service the courts tribunals all that is a massive massive area that takes years to learn and someone is going to be put into that post overnight
6200015 while these extras may offer variety and entertainment for some consumers they are also the subject of ongoing complaints

6200019 the steep price of new debt raises the level of difficulty for both institutions in remaining solvent as higher interest rate costs cuts steeply into their operating margins thereby threatening both agencies with even deeper losses in coming quarters

6200021 have to agree with you and internet revies you are spot on we live in a critical culture where people feel like they are experts just because they can post a review bayou is great try their brunch and all of these fair weather bon vivant wannabes are just unable to be satisfied
6200022 his will be a nice spot to spend with my kinds this labor day weekend
6200023 the point is internet reviews are just opinions of people you dont know most people only bother to write when they are displeased so the reviews are usually negatively biased personally id rather ask people i know who have the same standards i have and not trust random online reviewers
6200024 yeah read the internet reviews dont you ever google restaurants in areas you want to try
6200025 justin you are exactly right people to often get down on restaurants after a small mishap or a single dish operating a successful restaurant is really an enormous task youve got to please everyone ive personally tried bayou twice and i found it to be a nice addition to the area reviews are helpful but i think youve really got to try a place yourself at least twice to get a real opinion and if you have a problem with anything that happened during your dining experience tell the owner dont just blab on your blog about it without trying to remedy the problem

6200049 even with the growth in this market 90 percent of the market doesnt have a smartphone it doesnt make sense to fight over the 10 percent

6200052 we also note that because consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice providers consistent with federal policy may block transmissions of illegal content e g child pornography or transmissions that violate copyright law to the extent however that providers choose to utilize practices that are not application or content neutral the risk to the open nature of the internet is particularly acute and the danger of network management practices being used to further anticompetitive ends is strong
6200053 considers whether the network management practice is intended to distinguish between legal and illegal activity the commissions network principles only recognize and protect users access to legal content the sharing of illegal content such as child pornography or content that does not have the appropriate copyright is not protected by our principles similarly applications that are intended to harm the network are not protected

6200063 vijender had called me earlier in the day and i told him that if none of you come back with a medal then i will not accept the award because i wont deserve it if i dont get an olympic medal it shook vijender up he promised me that he wont let that happen
6200064 vijender concentrated very hard in the first round which helped him to take the 2 0 lead once he was through with the first round there was no pressure on him he played his natural game of right straight punches and left hooks
6200065 when you are boxing your mind is all fuzzy it is the responsibility of the coach sitting in the corner to point out the mistakes of the opponents and your own if akhil dose deta then his opponent wouldve dropped his guard to attack
6200066 then akhil wouldve prevailed since he has a good counterpunch but he wasnt helped by gurbax singh the coach at beijing we lost a medal because of that
6200067 i dont have any complaints against jeetu hes a new boxer he was up against the european champ he showed a lot of guts and even he couldve pulled off an upset the first two rounds he fought well in the third he missed a lot of upper cuts then the opponents coach must have told him to dodge that in the fourth round and in the fourth round jeetu himself shouldve swapped straight punches for hooks because he was missing the latter
6200068 then we will discuss how we can tackle the cuban boxer he will need a lot of aggressive counterpunches and have a lot of stamina because cuban boxers are very strong in this department

6200088 a ton of reasons gary at the time of the honey moon i was afraid that if i did it you would have thought you married a slut all i could think about was looking up into your eyes as the bartender screwed me and seeing your disgust there was no way i was going to throw my marriage away on my honey moon

6200094 that was over ten years ago since then ive seen you swap tongues with guys under the mistletoe at christmas parties and some of the dances youve done with guys at parties looked more like acts of sex than dancing and ive never gotten pissed
6200095 and im supposed to gamble my our marriage on your being able to handle my trying a strange cock
6200096 i wish you would it is and always has been my fondest wish to see you with another man even just hearing about it if you feel too nervous to have me there would be good enough
6200097 i really do wish i could believe you gary because ive thought about it ever since you brought it up but as much as id like to do it i will not risk my marriage unless i can be absolutely sure that you can handle it
6200098 well then since we both seem to want it how about we spend some time thinking about how to make it happen lets find a way that you can be sure i can handle it i know i can all we have to do is convince you

6200112 the whole time we had been sitting in his booth talking i had been thinking about your fantasy and i liked the looks of the guy and he seemed real nice so i just let things run to see where they would go
6200113 we got in his car embraced and then started necking like a couple of teenagers he was a pretty good kisser and you know how worked up i can get with a lot of frenching anyway while we were steaming up the windows he got his hand up under my skirt and started rubbing my pussy i spread my legs for him gary i opened myself up for him like an easy slut and he slid two fingers into my pussy

6200157 in het verleden heb ik herhaaldelijk gezegd dat ik bereid was om een stap opzij te zetten als ik daarmee fortis van dienst kon zijn maar het is beter voor de continu teit dat ik blijf
6200158 hij wilde niet noodzakelijk weg maar er was na 26 juni zoveel druk ik noem uitdrukkelijk de pers en enkele belangenverenigingen dat er gezamenlijk is besloten dat hij niet meer kon functioneren hij is het slachtoffer geweest van een nooit geziene campagne tegen fortis
6200159 dit was n van de moeilijkste beslissingen uit mijn hele carri re wetende dat vijftien procent van ons kapitaal kleine belgische beleggers zijn maar we hebben geprobeerd een evenwicht te vinden tussen het belang van de onderneming en het belang van de individuele aandeelhouders

6200183 what i think is kind of a bummer is if i dont play well these three weeks i wont be in the tour championship
6200184 i mean ive had a great year and i think thats not right i dont think thats fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the tour championship but ive kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway i won the memorial and that didnt get me in the u s open
6200185 it looks to me like what i did this whole year didnt matter and i dont think thats right
6200186 i think there should be some kind of system to where it favors the guy thats had a good year
6200187 i think it should favor the guy who has played well throughout the year but its not going to be in effect this year at all i think youll see somebody come deep and out of the pack that could actually win this thing if i understand it correctly i may not understand it correctly i dont know i really dont understand it anyway

6200218 any rulemaking which would require that passenger car tires be labeled to indicate their low rolling resistance or fuel economy characteristics
6200219 in big seizures theres a very strong tendency to ship ivory out of a different country than where its poached its a bit of a red herring
6200220 the methods we developed are very important in that regard because it focuses where the poaching is ongoing
6200221 crime syndicates were targeting specific populations for intense exploitation hitting them hard and fast to satisfy the demands of a particular consignment
6200222 at the time of the analyses authorities thought the ivory came from tanzania and or the democratic republic of the congo our analyses refocused the investigation allowed authorities to point the finger at zambia and get them to do something
6200223 were not in a position given we have 186 countries to oversee to start to pay for their evidence handling on a case by case basis were certainly not a bank
6200224 it is going to happen and it will be one of the great performance motorsports events in the region with programs for everyone ranging from the novice driver to the experienced pro
6200225 in order to devote time to personal and professional pursuits
6200226 even the caribou like to snuggle up to the pipeline
6200227 a lot of that comes from people who dont necessarily like us
6200228 funding and attention to the issue of alcohol sales to underage youth has made a difference
6200229 communities and states need to continue working to prevent sales to underage youth however more resources and attention also need to be focused on preventing alcohol sales to obviously intoxicated patrons
6200230 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6200231 i really hope it will develop into the gold standard technique
6200232 im pretty confident that its one of the better methods out there for testing cartilage health

6200242 despite great expectations and promising results of clinical trials we still lack sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer
6200243 with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious
6200244 i believe the vaccine is a great advance but we have to implement it properly to get the benefits and that hasnt happened
6200245 its good to beat carolina and everybody else all the other national champions
6200246 that says something for the passion of our fans were happy about that
6200247 obviously those two factors made a huge difference in that number
6200248 si stanno cominciando a notare i primi segni di una qualche ritirata in atto
6200249 the level of sacrifice required to qualify for the combat action ribbon by engaging the enemy in combat should warrant the issuance of a corresponding medal
6200250 require no exceptional performance sacrifice or engagement of the enemy
6200251 we constantly review our awards process but do not feel a change of this nature is warranted at this time
6200252 said the 24 year old sailor who asked that his name not be used for fear of retribution
6200253 the navy and marine corps achievement medal and the navy commendation medal those used to mean something not anymore now it just means you didn t catch a social disease while you were here or you re an e 7 who just showed up for work
6200254 we want to give as many people a chance to surrender and start a new page
6200255 most iraqi people just want to live normal and provide for their family
6200256 on the contrary this has given us greater strength to move forward
6200257 even though it was a mistake it shouldn t have happened
6200258 it makes it one of the most difficult provinces to get stability
6200259 i showed that to the governor and he just shook his head
6200260 that s our next hurdle putting face cards on the shiite side
6200261 whatever sect you are it doesn t matter if you are a criminal you will be prosecuted
6200262 it was a watershed event that showed civil authority over security forces
6200263 as far as we re concerned we ve opened the door for people to bring their names forward
6200264 he had a lot of trouble sleeping drank more than he had before he had some you know not fights because he wasn t in a condition to fight but you know he had some incidents
6200265 there was one incident where he stuck up for somebody and you know he got punched in the eye and couldn t do anything about it because he called me late at night and he was getting taken to the hospital for stitches we tried to encourage him to get help
6200266 the more people are in those environments the more likely they are to have some kind of effect most military lawyers when they get a case and they find out their client has been downrange they ask about it
6200267 i feel withdrawn a lot of the time and it s constant problems between my wife and i i just feel alone even when she s there
6200268 when i get put in stressful situations sometimes i just well the two things i pled guilty to
6200269 that s not how somebody should react to a situation like that
6200270 it s cut and dry it s almost like a brand
6200271 plaintiffs and defendants like it because it implies causation and it seems to be something that any of us developed if we were put in that situation
6200272 my hunch is that military juries will be sympathetic to it in a way that civilian juries won t they ll be more familiar with what deployment is like
6200273 the courts have really tightened up the rules on diminished capacity in recent years
6200274 if there is an environment that adds to the stress level they re going to recognize that it can turn into reasonable doubt
6200275 the judge took this fact into consideration when deciding the sentence
6200276 so i think it s a half and half chance if you can present strong and reliable evidence of your mental illness it helps
6200277 our focus is on making sure that any soldier charged with misconduct and there is associated issues stemming from the war zone be it ptsd or tbi traumatic brain injury or other disorders we bring these issues to light for the fact finder
6200278 there is a push from the army for leaders to be aware of ptsd and tbi commanders recognize these issues are relevant and these types of injuries are occurring
6200279 can criminal activity manifest itself as a symptom of ptsd
6200280 yes due to the angry outbursts the aggression the startle response the anxiety the fear involved
6200281 right now were going to go through the details of the decision before making further comment
6200282 programming dedicated primarily to the coverage and celebration of canadian athletes with a particular emphasis on amateur athletes
6200283 its a bit of a compromise and i think its not unreasonable
6200284 i think its a win win cbcs going be able to do what they said they want to do which is celebrate amateur sports and canadian athletes and athletics and not basically just be a second network for cbc to run live sporting events all day long
6200285 expects the cbc to abide by its commitment to broadcast 80 per cent canadian content in each broadcast year
6200286 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6200287 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6200288 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6200289 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6200290 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long
6200291 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6200292 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6200293 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6200294 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6200295 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6200296 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6200297 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6200298 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6200299 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6200300 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6200301 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps that we are taking today never before in our history as a province have we been prepared to take these important steps toward self reliance
6200302 this is hardly a giveaway you cant work above 100 per cent capacity
6200303 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6200304 chevrons participation in the hebron project gives our company a strategic platform for growth on the east coast of canada where we are exploring for impact sized resources in the orphan basin and have a major financial interest in the hibernia offshore oil project
6200305 i find the ethical considerations of supervised injections to be profoundly disturbing
6200306 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethic of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its all right to allow someone to overdose under their care
6200307 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the distribution of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed if this were done in a doctors office the provincial college of physicians would rightly be investigating
6200308 we know that if people have a safe place that they can talk to people that they eventually will come off drugs they eventually will get help and that they dont die
6200309 this guy clement is insulting physicians and the nurses that are working hard in the trenches of helping people get off drugs
6200310 already there are people saying injection sites are not enough that government should give out heroin for free others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs
6200311 palliative care for the dying insite offers no hope it is a surrender to a culture of disease and death
6200312 the appeal of the foolhardy court ruling for an indefinite drug law exemption for insite is a must the governments appeal and continued efforts to stop using tax money to keep addicts is the right responsible and compassionate approach
6200313 it is unbelievable that any helping professional could support the idea of keeping addicts addicts this is not ethical nor is it compassionate
6200314 dont the addicts deserve an opportunity to become healthy and productive citizens
6200315 it is just as serious to kill a 10 year old child
6200316 f rst og fremmest er jeg glad for at f 100 kampe det er selvf lgelig fede re hvis man vinder kampen jeg synes vi spiller en rigtig god f rste halv leg og i anden halvleg ser vi s hvorfor spanierne er blevet europames tre der er ingen tvivl om at de spil ler ualmindelig godt og vi spiller d rligere det h rer jo sammen

6200330 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten i can only take you so seriously
6200331 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6200332 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6200333 i love the smell of unit testing in the morning you know one time we had a function recursed for 12 hours when it was all over i walked up we didnt find one of em not one stinkin assertion failure the smell you know that stale pizza smell the whole workstation smelled like victory someday this code cycles gonna end
6200334 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6200335 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6200336 i think the people of california are sending to sacramento plenty of dollars 130 some billions of dollars they are sending every year for us to function if we cannot function with that money then there is something wrong with the system rather than with the people i dont want to go back and ask them for any tax increases they deserve better than that
6200337 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not a another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology

6200355 customers find mobile broadband easy to use and install but transmission speeds and to a lesser extent network coverage reduce the initial enjoyment of getting up and running it is in these areas that fixed isps have a distinct advantage and need to concentrate their marketing effort to minimise customer loss

6200507 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
6200508 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6200509 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a barrel of oil
6200510 we reiterate that fundamentals in the oil market suggest a return to a rising oil price environment
6200511 consumers can take some solace in the sell off but there are more supportive factors down the road here
6200512 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6200513 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6200514 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6200515 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6200516 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6200517 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6200518 from a consumer standpoint more and more of these feed costs are going to be passed on and that means higher prices at the supermarket

6200579 no hay duda de que la campa a para desacreditar a obama est dando resultados a mccain en este momento es un retroceso significativo para obama
6200580 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6200581 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6200582 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6200583 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6200584 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6200585 speaking to a cuban american audience in miami in august 2007 he said
6200586 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
6200587 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning

6200589 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6200590 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
6200591 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
6200592 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation we can turned out sic the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
6200593 im proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of doctor martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination
6200594 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6200595 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6200596 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6200597 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6200598 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose any serious threat to us
6200599 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
6200600 given the situation on the ground i think if we had our troops out in four years that would be an extraordinary accomplishment
6200601 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
6200602 what the world should interpret is my consistent position which is i believe in trade
6200603 i just want to make sure that the rules of the road apply to everybody and they are fair and that they reflect the interests of workers and not just corporate profits
6200604 i said well i would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al qaeda if they were in iraq so ya know this is how politics works mccain thought that he could make a clever point by saying well let me give you some news barack al qaeda is in iraq like i wasnt reading the papers like i like i didnt know what was going on
6200605 well first of all i do know that al qaeda is in iraq thats why ive said we should continue to strike al qaeda targets but i have some news for john mccain and that is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq
6200606 i intend to bring it to an end so that we can actually start going after al qaeda in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place thats the news john mccain
6200607 we started to see that virtualization was beginning to build more of an ecosystem and a landscape shift across many different facets of technology and business capability we saw it transcending into a paradigm shift allowing us to enter what we would consider a whole new era of computing namely service oriented computing
6200608 the goal was to leverage virtualization to build a much higher level of abstraction from the bits and bytes the luns the packet sizes into something that could really talk about the business capabilities users needed to achieve and how much money they were essentially willing to afford for those capabilities

6200734 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6200735 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

6200755 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

6200888 if the person in california would have looked at the photograph that we e mailed them they could have very clearly seen that this was not that individual
6200889 the officers on our end did everything they possibly could to try to get information from california to confirm or deny that this was the person they had stopped

6200901 eventually one worked but it took me 25 minutes so thats where the idea came from to put them all in one easy place for everyone to share
6200902 the site evolved just from a very basic website listing the discounts that i use to find and now the big retailers are working with us and sending us discounts direct they really want to be promoted in the site

6200916 unfortunately the fraud gangs are very good at tricking customers out of their log on details and one of the ways to combat that is to bring in a one time only password

6201067 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6201068 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 complete inventory of all e mails
6201069 its designed to make a copy of data at a specific point in time
6201070 data is backed up on a daily weekly and monthly basis as part of a disaster recovery strategy to ensure to protect the organization from data loss
6201071 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten i can only take you so seriously
6201072 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6201073 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6201074 these terrorist invaders want war go and give death to the invaders
6201075 whenever something goes wrong they dont threaten the soldiers or president arroyo
6201076 we are the ones who are threatened shot or set on fire
6201077 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6201078 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them
6201079 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit

6201102 what bad boy rockers did you have on your wall as a tennager
6201103 none i had doogie howser on my wall he was 16 years old and a successful dr can you imagine a junior in highschool with such job stability
6201104 hmm yes i did have balthazar getty from lord of the flies on my wall as well he was very cute and a decent actor but it was important he had a back up plan so as a getty i figured wed never go hungry i also used to make my girlfriends fill their tanks at the getty station instead of the mobil thinking i was helping him out
6201105 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6201106 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6201107 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6201108 the actions of the current prime minister show signs of high treason and political corruption
6201109 we are handing over materials in our possession to the security forces for a detailed examination
6201110 concerning the tensions between ukraine and the black sea fleet i think that the ukrainian authorities should behave in a more responsible way and not lead ukraine into military conflicts
6201111 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6201112 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6201113 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6201114 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6201115 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6201116 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption
6201117 we want to see on the ground the delivery of results
6201118 so sold out that microsoft japan actually put out an official statement about the situation in the land of the rising sun apologizing for the lack of consoles since demand has eclipsed supply microsofts supply has gone totally dry the company is ramping up production and the console will not be shipped to stores until next month
6201119 for many of our pacific island neighbours climate change is a current and unfolding threat to their physical survival
6201120 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6201121 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6201122 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6201123 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
6201124 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
6201125 president mwanawasa was a true servant of the people who served this country with dignity and honor
6201126 we have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country
6201127 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6201128 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development
6201129 he attached great importance to zambias relations with china and did a lot for the friendly cooperation between the two countries
6201130 we categorically reject that any sudanese be tried outside sudan we will never surrender any citizen to be tried abroad
6201131 the attempt to use the so called international justice against the country is an attempt to encourage rebel groups opposing peace to continue destruction and destabilisation to topple the regime in sudan
6201132 its own judicial institutions and is capable of trying anyone who violates justice
6201133 we will not hand over any sudanese citizen no matter what pressure there is even if we have to go to war
6201134 we are ready for war against the superpowers in order to protect sudanese citizens
6201135 that the suffering in darfur must definitely stop that human rights must be respected and that the sudanese government should make great efforts to that end
6201136 i dont think it was that ragey but its all a matter of perspective i guess
6201137 modernboys moderngirls rock out like the devil has taken them over the band sound like a southern fried white stripes
6201138 if mbmgs name isnt on everyones lips in the coming months theres definitely something wrong with the world
6201139 all of the songs feel fully realized with the band sporting a sound that s alternately jangly creepy a confident release that could easily bring bigger things

6201288 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
6201289 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
6201290 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees

6201300 desert tortoise populations in some areas have declined by as much as 90 since the 1980s and the mojave population is listed as threatened

6201305 werent interfering with tv channels which is sort of our point
6201306 these mics were broadcasting at much higher volumes than a broadband device would with no interference
6201307 although other devices have apparently been operating in their bands for years broadcasters have not objected to the very scenario they claim would justify prohibiting personal portable white space operations
6201308 broadcasters have for years acquiesced to these types of co channel operations
6201309 in our view theres a huge difference between wireless microphones and the unlicensed white space devices proposed by google and microsoft
6201310 by contrast the proposed white space devices would be mass produced and potentially operated by millions of untrained consumers in unlimited locations
6201311 hence under this scenario we believe the interference implications and threat to clear television pictures would increase exponentially

6201343 we are right on track with where we were last year with occupancy and left to lease even our down markets were not as down in the second quarter this year as those of our competitors
6201344 effective revenue management strategy backed up by a solid system forces a management process that prevents over correcting in leaner times it has helped us in boom times too when managers might have been content with good occupancy and perhaps were slow to push rents higher
6201345 the b product is still a fairly safe place to be even though were seeing rent growth flatten in some markets
6201346 we are carefully watching all our markets continuing to do acquisitions and working to maximize occupancy and maximize revenue
6201347 an important value of using lease rent optimization technology is that it requires we track competitors and watch our renewals more carefully so we can generate daily rents more in tune with our markets it also stabilizes our renewal pace
6201348 people mistakenly believe that when you implement a revenue management system you flip a few switches and everyone turns off their brains
6201349 laramars pricing optimization system requires that our entire team be more engaged with the market and our strategies on a daily basis
6201350 we track our results every year against industry advisers reit indexes and have consistently beat the reit revenue growth numbers every year

6201527 piata s a maturizat si oamenii prefera sa inchirieze acum in detrimentul cumpararii deoarece si au dat seama ca locuintele din perioada ceausista sunt supraevaluate si asteapta scaderea preturilor un apartament cu doua camere din titan ar trebui sa coste undeva la 40 000 50 000 de euro nu 100 000 cat era la inceputul anului
6201528 in aceste conditii si pe baza datelor anterioare putem aprecia ca tendinta crescatoare a chiriilor se va pastra dupa cele doua luni de varf traditionale septembrie si octombrie va urma o scadere moderata dar preturile se vor stabiliza la un nivel superior celui actual
6201529 cu siguranta ca diversificarea ofertei si conditii mai usoare de creditare vor pune presiune pe piata de inchiriere in prezent normele de creditare includ noi conditii de risc in timp ce costurile ascunse ale unor banci tin o buna parte din populatie departe de credite

6201561 este vorba de numai cateva saptamani si nu se poate vorbi de o cuantificare a unor sume toate platile vor fi reluate dupa ce vor fi imbunatatite procedurile tehnice semnalate de comisia europeana

6201563 pe piata locala au aparut specializarile pe distributie si logistica si in cativa ani vom ajunge ca in vest unde doar 20 30 din cifra de afaceri va veni din transport restul fiind distributia
6201564 flota a crescut pe de o parte in perioada 2004 2006 cand licentele de transport care reglementau intrarea in uniunea europeana au determinat mai multe companii sa si achizitioneze camioane mai performante euro 3 totodata cresterea economiei iar mai apoi intrarea in uniunea europeana au adus cresterea volumului de transport si implicit noi investitii in flota pe de alta parte incepand cu anul trecut companiile acceseaza mai usor piete aditionale fiind liber sa transporte intre doua tari membre ue
6201565 presiunea asupra tarifelor percepute la transport odata cu aderarea romaniei la ue si concurenta puternica mai ales din partea transportatorilor din ungaria cehia polonia slovacia este insotita acum de presiunea venita pe costuri din cresterea pretului barilului de petrol in acelasi timp operatori logistici de calibru fie din olanda sau germania si intr o oarecare masura operatori romani evadeaza din cercul vicios al luptei pe pret si evolueaza calitativ ca prestatori de servicii aditionale sau superioare

6201567 documento de marco conceptual y enfoque curricular en cultura c vica de paz
6201568 estamos discutiendo la ley 1565 que est a punto de fenecer y la implementaci n de una nueva ley nosotros no queremos caer en otro fracaso sino aportar desde abajo a cualquier nueva ley que pudieran implementar este es un trabajo valioso porque nos va a permitir apoyar a cualquier ley en el marco de paz y de valores en la implementaci n de una verdadera educaci n para todos los ciudadanos
6201569 de nuestras unidades educativas hemos sacado esta propuesta y hemos visto que cultura c vica de paz trabaje como un transversal para que todo maestro pueda aplicar en las diferentes reas de la educaci n
6201570 entonces la idea es que de una vez se realice y se presente esta curr cula en cultura c vica de paz a fin de hacerla aprobar de una vez para que de aqu a un a o ya tener todo y empezar a trabajar en todo el distrito
6201571 estamos en un panorama de conflictos bastante fuerte esa crisis de conflictividad que est marcando nuestro pa s por el separatismo regional principalmente merece ser trabajado desde las bases es decir desde las unidades educativas porque ellas no pueden quedar al margen de estos conflictos pues son entes multiplicadores de la paz esa es la idea
6201572 ne asteptam in continuare la un deficit de cont curent de circa 14 din pib in 2008 pentru a pastra acest trend favorabil este esential sa nu asistam la o noua apreciere nefundamentata a leului in conditiile in care cresterea salariilor peste productivitate duce la pierdere de competitivitate iar recenta majorare a dobanzii de politica monetara poate contribui la aceasta
6201573 exista o corelatie foarte puternica intre exporturile noastre catre zona euro si productia industriala din zona euro
6201574 cel mai mare risc de accelerare a deficitului de cont curent ramane insa incetinirea cresterii exporturilor catre ue vizibila in ultimele luni de la 20 8 in februarie la 16 8 in iunie

6201633 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6201634 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6201635 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6201636 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6201637 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6201638 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6201639 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6201640 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6201641 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6201642 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6201643 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6201644 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6201645 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6201646 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
6201647 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
6201648 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
6201649 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
6201650 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6201651 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6201652 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6201653 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6201654 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6201655 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6201656 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6201657 they want to know what were going to do about it
6201658 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6201659 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6201660 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6201661 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6201662 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6201663 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6201664 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6201665 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6201666 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6201667 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6201668 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6201669 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6201670 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6201671 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6201672 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6201673 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6201674 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6201675 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6201676 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6201677 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6201678 i live here on less than a dollar a month

6201680 just a quiet place just a basic neighborhood nothing much going on
6201681 from what ive been told theres a dead body somebody got killed just up the street
6201682 she asked people to please keep it down and the girl said please help me my boyfriend dj has been stabbed
6201683 this isnt the type of place where this would happen
6201684 its important that the elections law focus on elections not on attempting to use this legislation to solve a difficult and much more complicated problem
6201685 special constables and police support volunteers are a vital part of our modern police service
6201686 every day of the week specials are making a real difference responding to peoples concerns and making communities safer places to live the funding i am announcing today will ensure that the special constabulary can grow and continue their outstanding work
6201687 the nine new regional coordinators will drive forward a more targeted approach to the recruitment and development of special constables
6201688 feeling stuck or trapped a mix of emotions all painfully intense wish it would stop and give me a rest mind never turns off
6201689 slowed down responses near paralysis psychic energy throttled back to zero
6201690 as an instrument registering minute by minute degrees of it own suffering
6201691 the diabolical discomfort of being imprisoned in a fiercely overheated room
6201692 it is too often the quality of happiness that you feel at every moment its fragility while depression seems when you are in it to be a state that will never pass even if you accept that moods change that whatever you feel today will be different from tomorrow you cannot relax into happiness as you can into sadness for me sadness always has been and still is a more powerful feeling when i am happy i feel slightly distracted by happiness as though it fails to use some part of my mind and brain that wants the exercise
6201693 i believe it is a certain fact that most of the philosophers who have gone before us have been overthrown by the greatness of their genius i have noticed in the writings of the french mystics and in those of our fanatics here that when they give a history of the situation of their souls they mention a coldness and desertion of the spirit which frequently returns and some of them at the beginning have been tormented with it many years
6201694 sometimes i think i was just not made to be a happy person and that i should stop trying to be one not to settle for depressed sad etc but just something in between
6201695 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6201696 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6201697 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6201698 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6201699 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6201700 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6201701 it took some reflection it took an awful lot of discussion but the encouragement and the support seems to be there
6201702 i worked hard all last summer most of last year to prepare for a nomination which was held in the fall so my passion was certainly in seeking the job

6201705 las evacuaciones son voluntarias y mucha gente prefiere no dejar sus casas y pertenencias pero estamos recomendando que se vayan si las aguas siguen subiendo
6201706 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6201707 i want you to go to the window open it stick your head out and yell im as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore
6201708 its not just the housing picture that one has to fathom but its also public policy what is the government going to do
6201709 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6201710 will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists
6201711 relations with the vatican are constantly improving we can say that there are big developments
6201712 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6201713 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver

6201723 we dont think we have the right kind of tools to help decision makers plan for the future
6201724 one of the challenges we face is to make the case that while we are in a period of warming we should not expect every year to be the warmest year on record
6201725 is this how my life ends i have lost my mother and i am helping another person who is dying are you really going to let this happen to me at a time like this am i next on the list
6201726 jesus i need you now you have got to help me

6201737 the case managers will take the primary responsibility and will communicate with the family or significant other on changes that may occur in someones health status
6201738 i hid near him if i feel frightened ill always run to him tonys a friendly giant but i wouldnt mess with him
6201739 we set in a little bit more defensively once we made that adjustment we played much better
6201740 our strength comes in waves in the second third and fourth quarters

6201743 as a working mother of two school aged children and a former teacher i know first hand how difficult it is to successfully manage peak planning times especially the back to school season
6201744 our goal at centerd is to extend a planning lifeline to parents so that they feel less overwhelmed and more empowered to effectively organize and manage all of their activities be they family or professional big or small
6201745 every day i hear from moms confirming that they feel overwhelmed with the amount of activities they have to organize during the school year
6201746 not only do they have to stay on top of their own familys activities but many of them are also required to volunteer at their school and help plan events for their kids groups its great that companies like centerd are coming to the rescue and helping busy parents plan and organize complex group events that require a lot of time and volunteer coordination

6201758 theres definitely a broad consensus among our clients that there may need to be some concessions on saps piece but its also important to understand what value they may receive thats a fair discussion
6201759 some are definitely not enthused about a forced march and not thrilled about the level of service theyre already getting the flip side is some customers dont mind this hike because theyre going to get every penny out of it
6201760 werent interfering with tv channels which is sort of our point
6201761 these mics were broadcasting at much higher volumes than a broadband device would with no interference
6201762 although other devices have apparently been operating in their bands for years broadcasters have not objected to the very scenario they claim would justify prohibiting personal portable white space operations
6201763 broadcasters have for years acquiesced to these types of co channel operations
6201764 in our view theres a huge difference between wireless microphones and the unlicensed white space devices proposed by google and microsoft
6201765 by contrast the proposed white space devices would be mass produced and potentially operated by millions of untrained consumers in unlimited locations
6201766 hence under this scenario we believe the interference implications and threat to clear television pictures would increase exponentially
6201767 if men are not funny then they are thought of as just being not funny where as if you are a woman and youre not funny its because you are a women
6201768 i did a big show before the festival in front of 1 300 people in ealing and it was a typical lager fuelled friday humour crowd so when i came on they heckled me and the men kept talking to each other and ignoring me but finally i won them round
6201769 i didnt know i had a voicemail from the awards so i wondered what special thing i had done when i received about 18 texts today saying congratulations
6201770 i was so excited when i found out and was stunned
6201771 i will be nervous on the night but its just amazing to be shortlisted and we are all very different comedians so its is very important to keep in mind that whomever wins its not a reflection on the others
6201772 it was getting to the end of the decade and people were saying are women just not funny as for years they havent been on the shortlist
6201773 sarah is pure female stand up she is very brave and pippa doesnt have a promoter
6201774 i am very excited about the shortlist and will be very excited to hear the result on saturday night
6201775 there has been too much emphasis on why women dont do well in the awards it is nice to have a mixture
6201776 we just want to see the best acts gender is irrelevant when i go to a show

6201830 in terms of the outlook for the current financial year the board is of the view that the short term macro economic conditions in new zealand and internationally remain challenging

6201833 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of web 2 0
6201834 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6201835 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6201836 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6201837 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6201838 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6201839 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6201840 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6201841 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet
6201842 there never has been any 3d graphics in this space before and we think it opens up some dramatic new opportunities

6201846 i think one of the things that people forget about is we are not very monolithic as a party we really want to show some of that
6201847 we provide compelling evidence that at least one common variant in the slco1b1 gene substantially alters the risk of zocor induced myopathy

6201851 it could be that we have an advantage because of our starting five four play in the nba hernandez said it means experience to play against kobe bryant and those players we played in las vegas and you have to play a different type of basketball we have players accustomed to that we will try to adjust to that
6201852 nocioni asked to come out of the game and for a player like nocioni to ask to be changed he must have felt an acute pain
6201853 regarding carlos delfino he plays his best games when games are more heated
6201854 i am very glad because my players participated in the best games of the tournament said yannakis whose team had to win a spot in beijing via the fiba olympic qualifying tournament in july
6201855 when you wear the usa jersey a lot is expected
6201856 youre supposed to win gold medals so to miss out on an opportunity to do that was just very very disappointing
6201857 it was protocol to go up there and get it
6201858 but i didnt want it i honestly have no idea where that medal is i respect what it stands for but i only like gold medals
6201859 when we do it sucks really bad i dont know any other way to describe it it leaves a really really bad taste in our mouths and feeling in our stomachs
6201860 and whether or not we were on that world championship roster weve all experienced something close to that over the past four years weve all lost more games as a group than we had in a long time
6201861 i think that the rest of the world gained a lot of confidence when they saw that we could lose
6201862 wow the united states lost now they think they have a way in
6201863 thats the only reason why were here we want to end up repeating for that gold medal at the end of this tournament
6201864 we lost to russia thats pretty much been the motivation all along
6201865 its tough for us to even have that one blemish on our record
6201866 but its actually good for us in a way because well continue to use it as motivation maybe were more hungry because of it the last time we were out on the floor competing in a big game we lost and now that were back competing on a big stage that last loss is in the back of our minds
6201867 sometimes losses turn out to be the biggest win in a lot of ways because you learn more from them and they can really motivate you
6201868 i always say that that was the best thing that could happen to us wed been riding a high for so long it shows you that any given night if you dont bring your a game the world is good enough to beat you
6201869 thats the one thing thats in the back of our minds were not the world champions we have to go get it
6201870 if you look back at the history weve won the gold medal in the past three olympics but the competition has gotten much closer you go back to every olympics and the games have gotten closer and closer in the medal round and its always russia australia usa we know that they are right there breathing down our neck
6201871 weve beaten brazil weve beaten australia weve beaten china before
6201872 but the competition out there is getting better we cant take any game or any opponent for granted
6201873 were going to come ready to play no matter who it is
6201874 but especially because its russia theres no extra incentive needed except for the history we have im excited about putting ourselves in a place to get what we want which is a gold medal
6201875 theres no denying that we lost at the world championships
6201876 of course we werent at full strength but we lost nonetheless and were gonna have to come out and play hard even though the rest of the world is getting better we still feel like were the best in the world
6201877 we went down to brazil and we brought back a bronze medal that is unacceptable to all of us
6201878 we really should be targeting and prioritizing the younger girls 12 year olds prior to sexual activity
6201879 we used mathematical models to simulate the natural history of the disease
6201880 then superimposed these strategies whether they be screening hpv vaccine or a combination of both
6201881 we found the vaccine up to the age of 18 was consistently favorable
6201882 up to age 21 was favorable under generous assumptions about its efficacy up to age 26 was consistently unattractive in terms of cost effectiveness
6201883 we had the momentum and we ran away with it
6201884 i thought theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6201885 and he came up when we needed it the most right at the start of the second half
6201886 so we are just going to continue to apply pressure for 40 minutes and try to wear you down
6201887 and we are deep enough and talented enough where we can wear teams down on both ends of the court
6201888 we all want revenge on that game thats the game that we want to have i think they want to see us too i dont think theyre going to back away from us
6201889 we are very fortunate to sign a player of theos caliber
6201890 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the front court while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players
6201891 we are happy with the result said gasol the most valuable player of the 2006 fiba world championship who played his 100th game for spain
6201892 i expected us to come out with the defensive intensity that we started with today gasol said if we do that it means that we take away the pressure from us it gives us an advantage i m happy that we are in the semi finals but we still have two games left to play we need to be intense from the start as we were today
6201893 a los que cumplan los vamos a ascender y vamos a destinar recursos para darles est mulos econ micos y a los que incumplan los vamos a dar de baja y a sancionar

6201896 apple to attract more business software developers while android will become the favorite platform of phone manufacturers
6201897 apples distribution and promotion through its app store will dwarf anything most developers could achieve on their own with lower development costs better distribution and kleiner perkins 100 million venture fund ready to trade cash for success money not features will drive developers to the iphone platform despite apples restrictions and a 30 cut of application revenue
6201898 with no centralized distribution or marketing portal only software developers really wanting to push the envelope on handset design and user interfaces will jump on the android bandwagon
6201899 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6201900 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a barrel of oil
6201901 we reiterate that fundamentals in the oil market suggest a return to a rising oil price environment
6201902 consumers can take some solace in the sell off but there are more supportive factors down the road here
6201903 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6201904 these firms are licenses broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments
6201905 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6201906 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6201907 luego de que le dije al abogado que ya no requer a de sus servicios pues llegu a un acuerdo con jenni me ha estado llamando
6201908 this is the definitive expression of the partnership between aston martin and jaeger lecoultre im delighted that we have been able to premiere this technology in such an elegant solution it is the first time horology and automotive engineering have been combined in this way
6201909 obviously we feel like we havent talked to everybody who knew her
6201910 the forensic evidence is telling us it was a homicide
6201911 we dont want to focus directly on him we want to make sure we focus on every angle
6201912 we close west mountain at night especially the summit because we dont want anyone hanging out there
6201913 as the virtualization market continues to grow it is critical that our partners can explain the business rationale behind their technology decisions
6201914 avnets services help partners do just that by mapping virtualization solutions to company objectives and creating a formal business case around the investment
6201915 sun servers are ideal platforms for customers looking to virtualize their datacenter
6201916 with avnets assessment services and other demand generating activities our partners will be better positioned to help customers take advantage of suns virtualization capabilities
6201917 adding a virtual security solution like reflex vsm to our technology portfolio offers our partners further opportunities to deliver complete virtualized data center solutions that are more secure and at a lower total cost of ownership
6201918 as adoption of virtualization accelerates for next generation dynamic data centers organizations understand the urgent need to visualize secure
6201919 there are few more sought after groups for conventions by cities and hotels than 4 000 law professors
6201920 we are thrilled that aals has agreed to honor the boycott that californians against hate and our allies called for one month ago
6201921 theyre ensuring that not one additional penny goes to support these discriminatory moves
6201922 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6201923 arsenal is known for playing technical and skillful football and has a young but experienced squad

6201925 while these extras may offer variety and entertainment for some consumers they are also the subject of ongoing complaints
6201926 the accc is particularly concerned over what it considers is the failure of certain advertisements to adequately disclose the costs and ongoing nature of the services offered
6201927 the guy came out and made the best olympics of my lifetime

6201933 every day that goes by beyond the deadline of noon yesterday monday is a day that we see russia not living up to its word
6201934 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
6201935 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
6201936 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
6201937 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
6201938 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
6201939 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
6201940 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
6201941 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
6201942 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6201943 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
6201944 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
6201945 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
6201946 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
6201947 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
6201948 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
6201949 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
6201950 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
6201951 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
6201952 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
6201953 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
6201954 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
6201955 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
6201956 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
6201957 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
6201958 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
6201959 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
6201960 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
6201961 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
6201962 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
6201963 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
6201964 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
6201965 large scale efforts to manage the environment have a decidedly mixed record of success
6201966 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6201967 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6201968 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6201969 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6201970 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6201971 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms

6201983 after i make it ill sit down with it and let it talk to me things dont always turn out the way you plan so sometimes your materials take you for a trip and youre just following and doing what it tells you to do and if youre lucky itll tell you whats on its mind
6201984 a survey released this week by the canadian medical association found nearly half the population thinks people use the term mental illness as an excuse for bad behaviour

6202059 we are right on track with where we were last year with occupancy and left to lease even our down markets were not as down in the second quarter this year as those of our competitors
6202060 effective revenue management strategy backed up by a solid system forces a management process that prevents over correcting in leaner times it has helped us in boom times too when managers might have been content with good occupancy and perhaps were slow to push rents higher
6202061 the b product is still a fairly safe place to be even though were seeing rent growth flatten in some markets

6202233 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6202234 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6202235 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
6202236 help from security researchers in the form of usable bug reports and responsible time lines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible our vulnerability bulletins will credit responsible reporters of any flaws
6202237 a beta test by any other name is still a beta test

6202247 every single one of us has a certain amount of power residing in our mouth and in our tongues with the words that we can release to other people
6202248 death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit
6202249 there is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword but the tongue of the wise promotes health the truthful lip shall be established forever but a lying tongue is but for a moment
6202250 keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking guile depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it
6202251 the mouth of the righteous is a well of life but violence covers the mouth of the wicked
6202252 a soft answer turns away wrath but a harsh word stirs up anger the tongue of the wise uses knowledge rightly but the mouth of fools pours forth foolishness

6202479 the guy who has been the catalyst is led australia with 20 points while reserve glen saville added 13 points andrew bogut had just four points before leaving in the second half after reinjuring his balky left ankle
6202480 i think every time the united states takes one of those quick threes it helps australias defense
6202481 smart decision by kobe bryant looked like he was going to take the three david anderson on the closeout could not play with that type of quickness and kobe with a brilliant play
6202482 we felt that in this game that they were going to live and die by the three pointer they made a couple we had a couple of defensive breakdowns but we took care of it thats the beauty of this team on the fly we can solve problems without having to call timeouts communication is a big weapon for us nobody is afraid to talk to one another because we all respect one another
6202483 this is where you have to keep your poise worthington comes into the game hes a guy who has no value to the australians except maybe to get one of the better american players thrown out
6202484 bryant shot 17 37 459 from three point range last summer when team usa went 10 0 en route to winning the gold medal in the fiba americas tournament and he shot 7 19 368 from three point range when team usa went 5 0 during their pre olympic exhibition tour that adds up to 24 56 429 three point shooting during his 15 fiba games prior to the olympics bryant shot 361 from the 23 9 nba three point distance last season and is a 340 career nba three point shooter in other words at some point he is going to have a 6 8 game from the three point line and by the end of the olympics his three point shooting percentage will be around its normal level
6202485 the three point line now in fiba play thats where i shoot fadeaways from

6202611 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 1030 hours
6202612 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
6202613 a former lawyer mwanawasa was regarded as one of the africas most progressive leaders
6202614 his efforts to tackle corruption helped win zambia widespread debt relief
6202615 beyond zambia he became best known as a vocal and rare african critic of the zimbabwean president robert mugabe leading to strained relations between the southern african neighbors
6202616 a crowd clapped and cheered as president levy mwanawasa rose from the water in an outdoor baptistery behind a baptist seminary chapel building in lusaka zambias capital
6202617 this baptism was an incredible occasion for the baptist witness to many people who we have not had in church before
6202618 our excitement and prayers increased when he returned to church again and kept coming whenever he was in the country
6202619 the impact is not just in zambia this could have an impact on an international level
6202620 he could impact a lot of leaders he is in a position of influence and people need encouragement
6202621 the church is one of the biggest helpers of government in the fight against hiv aids

6202654 youre in here does it look like a nuisance you see any drugs being sold
6202655 we received some tips from citizens and a couple other sources that there was drug activity going on around the vicinity of the gameroom
6202656 the drug activity might be outside it probably is outside if they made 11 or 12 arrests or whatever they didnt make them in here and they hadnt arrested nobody in this place
6202657 none of the actual buys took place inside the establishment
6202658 im told that people basically came from inside and in several instances came from the inside of the building and the buys took place somewhere else

6202689 masons guide for daily living in it masonry is a search after light
6202690 every masonic lodge is a temple of religion and its teachings are instruction in religion masonry like all religions all the mysteries hermeticism and alchemy conceals its secrets from all except the adepts and sages or the elect and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead to conceal the truth which it calls light from them and to draw them away from it the truth must be kept secret and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason every mans conception of god must be proportioned to his mental cultivation and intellectual powers and moral excellence god is as man conceives him the reflected image of man himself
6202691 the true name of satan the kabalists say is that of yahveh reversed for satan is not a black god lucifer the light bearer strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of darkness lucifer the son of the morning is it he who bears the light doubt it not
6202692 the blue degrees are but the outer court or portico of the temple part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations it is not intended that he shall understand them but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them their true explication is reserved for the adepts the princes of masonry it is well enough for the mass of those called masons to imagine that all is contained in the blue degrees and whoso attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain
6202693 with tongue and pen with all our open and secret influences with the purse and if need be with the sword
6202694 we must allow all of the federations to continue just as they are with their systems their central authorities and diverse modes of correspondence between high grades of the same rite organized as they are at present but we must create a super rite which will remain unknown to which we will call those masons of high degree whom we shall select with regard to our brothers in masonry these men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy through this supreme rite we will govern all freemasonry which will become the one international center the more powerful because its direction will be unknown
6202695 the first world war must be brought about in order to permit the illuminati to overthrow the power of the czars in russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic communism
6202696 the second world war must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the fascists and the political zionists this war must be brought about so that nazism is destroyed and that the political zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of israel in palestine during the second world war international communism must become strong enough in order to balance christendom which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm
6202697 the third world war must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the

6202716 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states

6202725 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
6202726 but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
6202727 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
6202728 never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization
6202729 the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the central asian region and the caspian sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of kuwait the gulf of mexico or the north sea
6202730 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last
6202731 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
6202732 the last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic shift in world affairs for the first time ever a non eurasian power has emerged not only as a key arbiter of eurasian power relations but also as the worlds paramount power the defeat and collapse of the soviet union was the final step in the rapid ascendance of a western hemisphere power the united states as the sole and indeed the first truly global power
6202733 but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
6202734 the attitude of the american public toward the external projection of american power has been much more ambivalent the public supported americas engagement in world war ii largely because of the shock effect of the japanese attack on pearl harbor
6202735 for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia now a non eurasian power is preeminent in eurasia and americas global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained
6202736 americas withdrawal from the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival would produce massive international instability it would prompt global anarchy
6202737 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical eurasia is the globes largest continent and is geopolitically axial a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the worlds gnp and about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
6202738 it is also a fact that america is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad this limits the use of americas power especially its capacity for military intimidation never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization
6202739 two basic steps are thus required first to identify the geostrategically dynamic eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them second to formulate specific u s policies to offset co opt and or control the above
6202740 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
6202741 henceforth the united states may have to determine how to cope with regional coalitions that seek to push america out of eurasia thereby threatening americas status as a global power
6202742 uzbekistan nationally the most vital and the most populous of the central asian states represents the major obstacle to any renewed russian control over the region its independence is critical to the survival of the other central asian states and it is the least vulnerable to russian pressures
6202743 moreover they the central asian republics are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors namely russia turkey and iran with china also signaling an increasing political interest in the region but the eurasian balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region in addition to important minerals including gold
6202744 the worlds energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades estimates by the u s department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015 with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the far east the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the central asian region and the caspian sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of kuwait the gulf of mexico or the north sea
6202745 uzbekistan is in fact the prime candidate for regional leadership in central asia
6202746 once pipelines to the area have been developed turkmenistans truly vast natural gas reserves augur a prosperous future for the countrys people
6202747 in fact an islamic revival already abetted from the outside not only by iran but also by saudi arabia is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms determined to oppose any reintegration under russian and hence infidel control
6202748 for pakistan the primary interest is to gain geostrategic depth through political influence in afghanistan and to deny to iran the exercise of such influence in afghanistan and tajikistan and to benefit eventually from any pipeline construction linking central asia with the arabian sea
6202749 turkmenistan has been actively exploring the construction of a new pipeline through afghanistan and pakistan to the arabian sea
6202750 it follows that americas primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it
6202751 chinas growing economic presence in the region and its political stake in the areas independence are also congruent with americas interests
6202752 america is now the only global superpower and eurasia is the globes central arena hence what happens to the distribution of power on the eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to americas global primacy and to americas historical legacy
6202753 without sustained and directed american involvement before long the forces of global disorder could come to dominate the world scene and the possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical tensions not only of todays eurasia but of the world more generally
6202754 with warning signs on the horizon across europe and asia any successful american policy must focus on eurasia as a whole and be guided by a geostrategic design
6202755 that puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge americas primacy
6202756 the most immediate task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the united states from eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role
6202757 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last
6202758 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6202759 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6202760 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6202761 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6202762 while our business is strong in many markets issues at a major customer have caused orders from this customer to be lower than expected in q4 and into q2 of our fy09 accordingly we are reducing our financial targets for the quarter and the year we are also taking the necessary steps to control costs including workforce reductions as we continue to closely monitor the financial and operational status of the major customer even excluding orders for this customer our business looks strong for fy09 we are working hard to deliver profitability in 2009 based on business in hand and we believe that our cost cutting efforts will make this possible while not jeopardizing our ability to grow the business or invest in new product development
6202763 our retail business remains a challenge and will continue to have issues for a year or two service comps are a barometer as to the health of our business as nearly seventy percent of our revenues come from services third and fourth quarter same store service sales were the best we have reported in eight years regis is well positioned and i am more bullish today for the long term than i have been in over four years we are in the quintessential replenishment business offering affordable services and products our strategy of moderately increasing service prices is working and we plan to continue this strategy for the next several years however in the near term my optimism has to be moderated by the current state of the economy which is adversely impacting consumer related businesses we are no exception as our current quarter to date same store sales are down slightly
6202764 reflecting continued strong demand for our products and services across all business lines despite the current economic environment we are reaffirming our fiscal 2009 earnings per share guidance which represents estimated growth of 14 to 35 percent over fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share
6202765 we are committed to minimizing the customer downtime associated with the product reliability issues that we are encountering and as a result we are going to great lengths to ease the burden on our customers and remain true to the candela brand we expect the remainder of the calendar year to be challenging as we work through these issues and absorb the financial impact while navigating the weaker north american market however because we expect our litigation expenses to decline we expect to return to profitability in the first calendar quarter of 2009
6202766 our board of directors remains committed to capital preservation during these times of challenging industry conditions and as a sign of that commitment unanimously elected to forego payment to serve on the board the decision to suspend dividends was not taken lightly especially given sbkcs history of continuous quarterly dividend payments for over eleven years however we believe maintaining a strong capital position is a priority at this time and eliminating our dividend will improve our capital position by conserving approximately 1 0 million of capital per quarter
6202767 these orders were secured by our fisher klosterman ceco abatement effox h m white flextor and kirk amp blum subsidiaries they involve projects for the chemical refining ethanol power automotive and steel industries the largest of the orders is in excess of 2 million and involves equipment for a new automotive manufacturing facility in the southeastern united states
6202768 looking ahead to the third quarter of 2008 we expect conditions within chinas real estate market to remain challenging compared to the second quarter real estate transaction volumes for july and august in most leading cities will likely show bigger year on year decline this is because july and august of 2007 saw unusually strong transaction activities at the peak of the real estate market boom the 2008 beijing olympic games may have also caused a temporary slowdown in real estate transactions however we are seeing that many developers have adjusted their sales strategy in preparation for the peak season that traditionally begins in september by placing a sharp focus on increasing sales volumes and cash flows this trend combined with our continued belief that the long term fundamental demand for real estate in china remains strong provides compelling reasons for transaction volumes to rebound starting in september
6202769 orders for semiconductor equipment continue reflect the pronounced cutback in capital expenditures this year and are at the lowest levels since november of 2003
6202770 while chip makers remain attentive to cost controls this remains a highly cyclic industry factory utilization levels unit demand growth and planned fab projects suggest that new investment activity will resume in 2009

6202817 while oil may continue to sell off few expect it to fall much below 100 levels considered extremely high only a few short months ago
6202818 more consolidation in the gold market looks necessary and a weekly close above 850 will be needed prior to the primary trend reasserting itself
6202819 the important short term influences on gold will be whether the dollar can keep strengthening and whether oil prices continue to fall
6202820 however it is likely that the important fundamental long term drivers of increasing macroeconomic and systemic risk as seen in the fresh fears regarding the financial system yesterday and geopolitical risk

6202838 we also note that because consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice providers consistent with federal policy may block transmissions of illegal content e g child pornography or transmissions that violate copyright law to the extent however that providers choose to utilize practices that are not application or content neutral the risk to the open nature of the internet is particularly acute and the danger of network management practices being used to further anticompetitive ends is strong

6202859 this is just a processing center nobody will sleep here
6202860 i spend quite a lot of time studying data and keeping fit between races
6202861 the recent break gave me an opportunity to get away from that and focus on recharging my batteries
6202862 but going to a new circuit doesnt really change anything we have done some preparation work back at the factory but everybody is in the same situation our main focus will be to get a good baseline during the three free practice sessions
6202863 of course i want to be at the next games when i was in athens i looked forward to coming to beijing when youve been to one you want to go to the next you kind of catch the bug
6202864 vicky will be 19 in 2012 so its a possibility ohuruogu said shell be better than me thats what they say but i wasnt running at her age
6202865 i think that in order to dominate the 400m you have to be able to run low 48sec said johnson christines not the fastest out there so i dont think shes going to be able to dominate if other people run what theyre capable of
6202866 go out and run a fast time id have to have a good motivation she said you cant just tell me to go out and run i was hoping id get the british record in the final but i was a bit far off
6202867 i think it will come a lot of it is about confidence my races are touch and go my perfect race here was still the semi final it was controlled even if it was not as fast as the final
6202868 i think realistically its something ive got to put up with whether i like it or not
6202869 its not something i let get to me too much because my job as an athlete is to keep on performing and thats what im going to do
6202870 im not expecting people to forget but its important that i keep doing what i like doing working honestly thats what i believe in it doesnt bother me too much any more neither it seems does the controversy surrounding her eligibility for the role as the so called poster girl of 2012 ive not heard much about that she said either way the olympics are going to be in my town im going to be happy and im going to be there whether you like it or not i enjoy going out and running and anything else is a bonus
6202871 me and keri anne and becky were just mates we went on holiday together last year and now weve all three got olympic medals its just mental
6202872 i worked hard for this i dont want a free pass
6202873 its about being able to sprint the last 400 metres
6202874 a lot of things happened out there that i wouldnt do because its unsportsmanlike
6202875 when i got out at the end i couldnt move id given everything
6202876 yeah id hoped for top five maybe i should be disappointed but i did my best and you cant do better than that
6202877 amir will be ready for a world title in three or four fights
6202878 at that point he will beat one of the world champions but i still wouldnt put him in with the likes of pacquiao but in a year to 18 months time he will be ready for anybody he has as much natural talent as anyone i have worked with he has all the tools to make it to the top he is a very exciting fighter
6202879 its not just about winning the world title its about winning it and staying there as a world champion
6202880 you see kids stop all the time on the way back from school longing to have a go
6202881 it would need insurance and supervision but what a great facility it would be cycling is a brilliant option put down your guns and knives and get on your bikes
6202882 it is a life skill every bit as much as swimming which is on the curriculum more kids bike than swim it also helps tackle fitness issues such as obesity
6202883 before we came to beijing i refused to give a medal target he said all we could do was complete our preparations as well as possible the moment i knew we had got everything right was on the first night when young steven burke delivered a time of 4min 22sec in the individual pursuit a few minutes later chris hoy and the team sprint team smashed through the 43 seconds barrier in qualifying i looked at coach shane sutton and we just knew that we were right on it
6202884 so many teams have raised their level our backs were up against the wall and we produced a world record to qualify we then bypassed 3min 54sec altogether to go to 3 53 for a second world record in the final to produce that in competition was extraordinary
6202885 young riders like geraint thomas and ed clancy have been great for the squad they are so aggressive and fearless they want to batter the opposition
6202886 we will go for a medal or nothing mentality and we have to be brutally honest with each other we do really tell the truth warts and all to one another
6202887 the night before the games started we had a meeting of all the coaches and i asked if there was any stone we had left unturned we all agreed that there wasnt and that whatever happened next was down to the riders in the event they have done the team and themselves proud

6202890 you think the president of the university is gonna open a beer hall in his house do you think the coach of the baseball team or football team will open it up they should raise their standards and think that drinking is not part of college life everybody has responsibility on this and drinking at universities isnt something you should be proud of you dont send your son or daughter to learn how to drink at universities you send em for an education
6202891 students at colleges and universities across the country and unfortunately at many high schools are already drinking despite the fact that the lawful age is 21
6202892 there is a real argument that needs to be considered about whether it would be safer for them to drink lawfully on campus where responsible use of alcohol could be modeled
6202893 ive seen many people who lost their family life because their father or mother drank
6202894 chaput is one of the most respected leaders of the catholic church in america
6202895 his record is a strong commitment to social and economic justice and the principles of the catholic faith hes also a strong patriot
6202896 pro life democrats who are proud catholics like myself feel this is an insult to our values the party should be aware there are strong pro life people who are politically successful
6202897 im happy to see they are having prayer at their sessions and they have a right to choose whom they want to do that
6202898 hopefully they will know being catholic is more foundational to their identity than anything else
6202899 render unto caesar serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
6202900 to convince people they should not be embarrassed at being catholic and not buy the supposedly american notion that people should shelve their faith when they enter the public square
6202901 i am tired of people telling religious folks to be quiet in the public square because of constitutional questions of separation of church and state

6202910 this case was never about discrimination against patients on the basis of sexual choices it was about discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
6202911 physicians of course must treat all patients with compassion and respect regardless of the belief systems or sexual norms of the patients but tolerance is a two way street we must also respect the right of healthcare professionals to make decisions based on ethical standards
6202912 this decision reaches beyond the medical profession taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
6202913 neither physician hospital nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of personally held moral principles
6202914 if the courts are going to decree that only a certain type of physician may practice in california the net result is that patients will have decreased access to physicians
6202915 this case starkly demonstrates the take no prisoners approach of the gay rights movement
6202916 they will not stop until they have silenced or bankrupted every voice of conscience who disagrees with them in light of this and similar rulings pji is redoubling its efforts to defend people of faith who will not compromise their moral values

6203052 this type of regulation does nothing to improve health care in our state it just further restricts a womans ability to make decisions about her own future
6203053 proactive step making sure that proper safety requirements are in place if a woman experiences complications after an abortion
6203054 it is just as serious to kill a 10 year old child
6203055 how can i comment when a mother loses her child
6203056 this person i cannot even say his name does not have a heart
6203057 he has a stone where his heart should be and he has rotten watermelon for brains my son was all heart and brains and he used them for good he was devoted to his mother his father his sisters
6203058 he has destroyed our lives and i hope someone will destroy his
6203059 its been 1 302 days without henry his father doesnt remember things and i dont know how many times hes said was that henry on the phone i have to say no hes never going to call us again it has been hell for us

6203070 i want to assure our shareholders that were working actively with our bankers and advisors to determine the next steps to address enhancement of our share price
6203071 ive never done that if i am a follower of christ i should know what he says about prayer
6203072 prayer is not monologue but dialogue gods voice is its most essential part listening to gods voice is the secret of the assurance that he will listen to mine
6203073 it is only when we know that we are powerless that we are prepared to listen to jesus christ and to do what he says
6203074 a child is never shy before his mother and a child of god is conscious of his worthiness namely his entire dependence
6203075 dear god please give us a good day tomorrow so grandpa and i dont have to fish in the rain
6203076 we can be tired weary and emotionally distraught but after spending time alone with god we find that he injects into our bodies energy power and strength
6203077 learn to worship god as the god who does wonders who wishes to prove in you that he can do something supernatural and divine
6203078 the greatest thing anyone can do for god and man is pray it is not the only thing but it is the chief thing the great people of earth today are the people who pray i do not mean those who talk about prayer nor those who say they believe in prayer nor yet those who can explain about prayer but i mean those people who take time to pray
6203079 god will never tell us to do something that gratifies the flesh
6203080 pursuing prayer is prayer on a mission it is diligent fervent constant persevering determined and convinced
6203081 if bible christianity is to survive the present world upheaval we shall need to have a fresh revelation of the greatness and the beauty of jesus he alone can raise our cold hearts to rapture and restore again the art of true worship
6203082 the point to remember is that all our circumstances are in the hands of god the purpose of prayer is to reveal the presence of god equally present at all times and in every condition
6203083 it matters little what form of prayer we adopt or how many words we use what matters is the faith which lays hold on god knowing that he knows our needs before we even ask him that is what gives christian prayer its boundless confidence and its joyous certainty
6203084 prayer for jesus christ formed the brackets in which he accomplished his earthly work
6203085 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates

6203092 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6203093 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6203094 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
6203095 help from in the form of usable bug reports and responsible time lines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible our vulnerability bulletins will credit responsible reporters of any flaws
6203096 a beta test by any other name is still a beta test
6203097 its a wise practice for google emphasizing that android is going to be solid and stable is important to google particularly because we are seeing a version one release and we know that version one releases come with their own set of challenges
6203098 obviously how apple tests its products and the forum in which it tests its products is somewhat different than what google is doing here

6203104 we have never been a band to write the same record twice and we have never enjoyed records that are one single and 11 worse versions of the same song this record is the most diverse thing we have done to date every song is different and brings something new to the overall experience of the cd when you look back to all the classic records of our time they are full of all kinds of different songs vulgar display of power just wouldnt be the same without this love and hollow our record is a breath of fresh air in a scene that is turning stale

6203137 the leadership and organizational structure over athletics financial operations show signs of being overextended at a time when the football program is undergoing rapid growth and success
6203138 theyre basically diverting funds that were sold as sponsorships to pay for other things that are not on the books of the university this is not the right way to spend public money the money should come to the university and then be allocated from there its inappropriate

6203167 you learn what moves you can make and when you can make them
6203168 its basically managing risk risk versus reward every lap every turn youve got to be aggressive and take some opportunities but at the same time its a small race track and accidents happen and they happen often
6203169 i hit the wall a lot in qualifying and the race
6203170 we need to do a better job in qualifying because if you start in the back those guys are on you in no time
6203171 theyre all over you before you even get into a rhythm and you fall a lap down you cant fall a lap down at bristol now that its been repaved when youre trying to pass somebody you can go high or low and make room for yourself

6203178 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently under way what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
6203179 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any real sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan
6203180 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of components the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province
6203181 finding one man intent on remaining hidden within a province measuring more than 22 500 sq km is no easy feat
6203182 conducting an operation to capture him without loss of life is even more difficult and the success of this operation speaks volumes for the inherent capability within the sotg australias special forces with support from the afghan national army and international security assistance force have refined the process of identifying those in oruzgan who continue to wage their campaign of terror

6203199 while minimizing exposure to placebo in this population of children
6203200 more patients treated with adalimumab than patients treated with placebo had acr pedi 30 50 70 or 90 responses in both the methotrexate stratum and the stratum not receiving methotrexate
6203201 after 104 weeks of treatment 40 of patients had an acr 100 response
6203202 patients underwent randomization within each stratum but not across strata
6203203 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6203204 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6203205 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6203206 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6203207 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6203208 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6203209 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6203210 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6203211 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6203212 shit dude i didnt mean that young how the fuck am i going to explain this

6203218 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6203219 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6203220 so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6203221 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is

6203229 the all saved freak band is a different kettle of fish at once more powerful and more disturbing and a reminder of how apocalyptic convictions christian or otherwise can go sour the band began when a drugged out chicago guitarist named joe markko moved to ohio where he met a fiery street pastor named larry hill convinced that the chinese and or russians were coming hill set himself up as patriarch of an isolated survivalist christian commune replete with guns and goats when he performed hill wore a wide amish hat and a priests habit and he sang to hector and convert

6203231 there is a real fire in the belly natalie desperately wants the gold medal
6203232 they started the competition a little flat but have really picked things up
6203233 if michael phelps can win eight gold medals why cant usa softball
6203234 thats what olympic competition is about its about giving the people watching at home chills
6203235 were hitting on all cylinders were resilient we never say never well continue fighting until the last out
6203236 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6203237 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6203238 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6203239 ohh there are a million ways to stop a caster from casting
6203240 nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news which obeys its own special laws
6203241 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6203242 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6203243 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6203244 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6203245 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6203246 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6203247 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6203248 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6203249 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6203250 probably just looking for the celebrity with the biggest ass
6203251 independent of the shooting war on drugs there is the problem of institutions being infiltrated by criminals and corrupted
6203252 impunity is in view of everyone day after day we all see it even to the point of smiling ironically or shrugging our shoulders
6203253 america has been in mexicos shoes flush with the bounty of illegal liquor sales organized crime thoroughly penetrated the u s justice system during prohibition as long as americans willingly bury mexican drug traffickers in greenbacks progress in constraining the trade is likely to be limited
6203254 you cant implificate me this time im up to my floppy ears in afghanistan trying to pacificate those presidentless folks over there
6203255 shoot i concoctified katrina to guarantee me one more term in office i did not have sex with that woman ms nature im still experimentating on a secret mass amnesia event that will allow me to sorta reintroducify myself as the next american messiah that way i can get reelected all over gain for the first time ive codenamed the project operation forget me not no wait operation forget me no wait oh just forget it
6203256 the hardest thing for a first time candidate to do unless hes already particularly well known in the community for something hes done is to build name id
6203257 dont have to go through the months and months and months of introducing themselves to voters
6203258 an important thing to realize i think is that youre not starting necessarily from where you finished last cycle
6203259 the mistake a candidate can make who got very close last cycle is to assume they start at that point and all they need to do is make up for the 1 000 votes or the 3 000 votes or whatever it is theyre short
6203260 it might be easier to start off with a blank slate than to start off with a guy whos got very high negatives
6203261 theres nothing that will teach you to deal with the media better than dealing with the media you learn that its a bleeping hot stove and it will burn you if you put your hand on it
6203262 the issue matrix is so different this time around and i believe it certainly plays to my strength
6203263 last time kagen ran against the establishment and now he is the establishment
6203264 its kind of like a team that made it to the super bowl and loses but they have that experience of going very far and the next time theyre going to win it
6203265 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6203266 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost

6203270 by design torrent tracking sites are the equivalent of commercial emporiums for infringing content
6203271 the downloading and uploading of different pieces of a content file from many other users simultaneously
6203272 i wrote isohunt when i was in school it kind of grew from a hobby to business eventually i didnt have time for school
6203273 there is no other ruling im aware of in the history of jurisprudence that having a search engine for dot torrent files is legal or not
6203274 there are no copyrighted works touching his sites theyve got to prove a infringement occurred in the united states this isnt grokster or napster there are no copying devices
6203275 der gef llte ranzen sollte am ende nicht mehr als zehn prozent des k rpergewichts des kindes wiegen
6203276 im durchschnitt hatte jeder ranzen ein gewicht das bei 17 2 prozent des k rpergewichts der kinder lag
6203277 das ist die nat rliche reaktion darauf dass sich durch den ranzen der k rperschwerpunkt etwas nach hinten verschiebt
6203278 selbst ein schwererer ranzen wird eine gesunde kindliche wirbels ule nicht sch digen dazu wirkt das gewicht viel zu kurz auf den r cken ein
6203279 selbst bei schlaffer muskulatur wirkt ein ranzen zu kurz auf den r cken ein um die passiven strukturen wie wirbelbogen gelenke b nder und bandscheiben sch digen zu k nnen
6203280 die empfehlung von zehn prozent stammt aus der zeit vor dem ersten weltkrieg sie bezog sich darauf wie schwer der tornister eines rekruten sein durfte damit bei langzeitbelastungen keine muskul ren erm dungen auftraten
6203281 diesen wert auf ranzen und schulkinder anzuwenden ist v llig unrealistisch
6203282 es gibt zudem keinen einzigen beleg daf r dass der r cken eines kindes gesch digt wird wenn es einen schwereren schulranzen tr gt
6203283 ihr haltungs und bewegungsapparat ist daher v llig unzureichend trainiert
6203284 sitzt ein kind dauerhaft nach vorn gebeugt werden vorwiegend die vorderen abschnitte der wirbelk rper belastet dadurch wird ihr wachstum an dieser stelle fr hzeitig gestoppt hinten wachsen die wirbel jedoch weiter dadurch entwickelt sich zunehmend eine rundr ckenform diese haltungsschw che wird schlie lich zu einem haltungsschaden der nicht mehr zu beheben ist
6203285 they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate
6203286 year after year one thing has become clear when women vote women and democrats win
6203287 thats why this study is so important to understanding the messages and issues that will motivate this critical segment of the electorate
6203288 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6203289 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6203290 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6203291 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6203292 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6203293 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6203294 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6203295 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6203296 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6203297 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6203298 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president

6203300 the myth that the apollo moon landings were faked has become part of the cultural fabric

6203302 we dont know for sure but we think that this happened

6203307 a local at risk service demonstrated a lower rate of transition to psychosis 7 when compared with local 22 30 and international 36 50 data in the absence of targeted preventative interventions
6203308 weve got a lot of delegates inspired by the candidate
6203309 many are issue oriented many are generally inspired all carry the same we need change theme
6203310 we had 880 000 democrats vote in the primary thats 280 000 more than before
6203311 goes from college students to senior citizens its a very diverse group some are doing it for the first time
6203312 im fortunate that the first time im going im going to witness history
6203313 we really have a good cross section of people going it says a lot there were a lot of new and young voters in the primary and we dont want to lose them in november we want to keep them engaged
6203314 i think people are ready for change to turn this economy around to end this war
6203315 a sup erb integration of academic and leadership skills a strong sense of personal identity and a sound understanding of global ethics
6203316 there is no virtue in that kind of talk and it should always be discouraged my appeal even then was that responsibility is a significant message but our needs require real government intervention and private sector incentives to address the issues such as unemployment building affordable housing and making educa tion even more affordable which really was my point it was a very painful period for me to have gone through that
6203317 hes free to express himself and it does not bother our relationship as father and son at all he was taught to give his opinion in our house hold and he did it in love hes tough hes smart he has a future in politics he didnt want the impression to be that that my faux pas was his faux pas because it is not i respect his right to express himself
6203318 i think we have an outstanding candidate we have the burden now to fully register and vote there are still maybe six to eight million blacks unregistered who should not miss this hour this opportunity now that we have a who lets focus on the what
6203319 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6203320 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6203321 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6203322 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6203323 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6203324 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6203325 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6203326 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6203327 the important thing is not to win but to take part
6203328 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6203329 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6203330 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6203331 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6203332 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6203333 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6203334 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6203335 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6203336 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6203337 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6203338 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6203339 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6203340 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6203341 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6203342 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6203343 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6203344 sometimes when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all theyve got and win just one for the gipper
6203345 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6203346 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6203347 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6203348 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
6203349 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6203350 is it doesnt have any real distinct tonality to it its pleasant to listen to its an voice
6203351 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6203352 with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to off shore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama
6203353 this election cycle they are asking me to sound less like an announcer and more like a real person
6203354 it often feels like there is sort of more colloquial language like when i say things like is this really his plan
6203355 the sort of straight authoritarian announcer sometimes is still appropriate but a lot of times it will be noise or wallpaper to people
6203356 and i invented the remote control too another round of this and ill sell my television
6203357 dah darkies is coming to get yah women yah people of de fox network arise dis is prez mcsame tellin yah all dat de women will be takken by de darkier dats all
6203358 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6203359 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6203360 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6203361 but she made it very clear shes really not counting on it and she was urging all of her supporters to get beyond the speculation
6203362 it would be such a shocker at this point because so many people have written it off
6203363 im not saying its what he would do but if he has quietly kept her in the mix it would have a powerful effect to kind of come out of the blue
6203364 my life my death my prayers and my sacrafices are all for the sake of allah the creator the most merciful
6203365 puzzzles in a uneccesary cryptic fashion that boogles ye mind matey
6203366 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keep on skyrocketing
6203367 ive heard a rumor that youre going to pick a pro life vp is that true
6203368 not talking about the process of the vice presidential situation
6203369 i believe that life applies to those that are not born as well as those that are born
6203370 in the past youve alienated a great deal of conservatives who believe that conservative principles are always the answer by stepping across the aisle
6203371 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can actually rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone who will cause us to want to stay home perhaps
6203372 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6203373 while john mccain wants to give big corporations and oil companies hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks hes offering nothing to 100 million americans
6203374 obama will provide a 1 000 tax break for 95 of workers and their families and not raise taxes on families making less the 250 000 a year
6203375 americas business taxes are the second highest in the world and that is driving american jobs overseas said mccain spokesman tucker bounds
6203376 so while american families are hurting and jobs are becoming scarce barack obama is pushing for billions in higher taxes its a recipe for economic disaster
6203377 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6203378 yet again john mccain makes another false low road attack while hes offering just more of the same bush economics that have failed us for eight years
6203379 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6203380 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6203381 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6203382 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6203383 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6203384 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future

6203389 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
6203390 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
6203391 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
6203392 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
6203393 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
6203394 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6203395 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6203396 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6203397 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6203398 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6203399 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6203400 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6203401 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6203402 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6203403 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6203404 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6203405 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6203406 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
6203407 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
6203408 take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict
6203409 its not enough for the next president to commit again to trying
6203410 to muster the political will for an intensive effort that brings the parties together hammers out their differences and brings about an agreement
6203411 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6203412 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6203413 obama campaign officials never bought the argument that clinton was the second choice of edwards voters immediately after edwards dropped out of the race at the end of january obama won 11 straight contests in a row

6203416 clinton exploded demanding to know why the campaign wasnt on the attack solis doyle was put on a plane to iowa the next day to oversee the closing weeks within hours of the call the panicked staff produced a blistering attack on obama for what it characterized as evidence of his overweening lust for power he had written a kindergarten essay titled i want to become president the campaign was mocked for weeks
6203417 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that

6203419 praying for a deluge to drown out barack obama at the democratic national convention in two weeks time
6203420 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
6203421 no one has been found guilty of anything lets not trash the constitution
6203422 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely antiwar ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul

6203424 when ms hunter her baby and the youngs moved to california around the end of last year they all initially lived in the same residence according to an associate of mr young and mr edwards
6203425 but the arrangement strained relationships and ms hunter moved into a different residence which cost about 6 000 a month in rent
6203426 there is no longer this widespread belief among the wise guys and gals of both parties that were all just sitting around waiting for this race to break in obamas direction the polls as well as the money race suggest otherwise
6203427 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
6203428 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
6203429 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
6203430 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
6203431 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
6203432 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
6203433 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
6203434 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
6203435 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6203436 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6203437 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6203438 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6203439 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6203440 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6203441 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6203442 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
6203443 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
6203444 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
6203445 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
6203446 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6203447 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite

6203471 discussed the negotiable issues public action committees were formed for all of these issues without exception
6203472 i do not think this year we will reach to an agreement with the israelis for several reasons the first of which is the negotiating process is difficult second these days the israeli side is concerned with its internal problems
6203473 we not accept less than a palestinian state with the 1967 borders with east jerusalem as its capital we will unless a just solution of the issue of the refugees based on the international resolutions and the right of return
6203474 discussed the negotiable issues public action committees were formed for all of these issues without exception
6203475 we can not face the challenges while coup and division are still going on
6203476 we do not deny that there is reason for disagreement but the hamas movement had committed grotesque crimes against palestinians in the gaza strip and against fatah members it never happened that a palestinian would kill another in the same way hamas did in killing the palestinians and stripped them of their resistance arms and force them and their families out of the gaza strip the one who used to do so is the israeli occupation
6203477 we with a national dialogue based on dealing with the problems from their roots we do not want fragile dialogue that will increase the random of the palestinian situation we want a real dialogue that would eliminate division from the palestinian body
6203478 we as palestinians have to make honest efforts to bring success to the egyptian efforts aiming at bridging the rift among palestinians
6203479 we demand the release of the palestinian leaderships without discrimination
6203480 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you

6203482 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines

6203484 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6203485 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6203486 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6203487 they told me there are going to be resources here
6203488 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6203489 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6203490 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6203491 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6203492 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6203493 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6203494 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6203495 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6203496 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6203497 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6203498 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6203499 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6203500 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6203501 we are in ohio in a significant way with a full operational staff with offices all across the state
6203502 weve been running television ads now for i believe seven weeks we view ohio as a very important part of our puzzle to get enough electoral votes to win the presidency for barack
6203503 there is no question that ohios electoral votes are critical to that victory
6203504 its always a major battleground state its really no different this year
6203505 ive been engaged in a lot of presidential campaigns during my life i have never seen a presidential campaign in ohio come anywhere close to where this campaign is organizationally and in terms of having actual man and woman power in the field

6203511 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
6203512 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
6203513 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
6203514 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
6203515 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
6203516 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
6203517 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
6203518 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
6203519 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
6203520 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
6203521 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
6203522 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
6203523 gamle fotoalbums med billeder fra fortiden hvad skal jeg med dem
6203524 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
6203525 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
6203526 china believes all countries while adhering to their international obligations of nuclear non proliferation has the right of peaceful use of nuclear energy and to carry out international cooperation in this regard
6203527 switzerland is in favour of india developing its civilian nuclear energy switzerland depends on nuclear power for 30 of its energy needs increasingly there is a realisation that the world has to depend on nuclear energy if they have to solve the problem of global warming europe is also realising it
6203528 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6203529 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6203530 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6203531 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6203532 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6203533 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6203534 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6203535 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6203536 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6203537 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6203538 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6203539 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

6203542 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community

6203545 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6203546 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6203547 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6203548 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6203549 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6203550 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6203551 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6203552 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6203553 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6203554 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6203555 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6203556 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6203557 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6203558 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6203559 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory

6203561 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6203562 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her

6203567 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6203568 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6203569 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6203570 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6203571 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6203572 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6203573 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6203574 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6203575 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

6203858 the kind you have never had before in your life
6203859 if we knew she had this before it ruptured we often can treat these minimally invasively
6203860 we can access the artery via a catheter that we thread through the groin and go all the way up to the brain when it gets to the brain we pass tiny little coils made of platinum to seal the aneurysm
6203861 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them

6203868 the statehood green party not the democratic or republican parties stands with the people of washington dc in our demand for the real citizenship democratic self government and full representation in congress that all other americans enjoy
6203869 were dismayed that democrats dcs largest political party have abandoned the goal of statehood
6203870 we dispute ms nortons assertion that dc is not ready for statehood and were unhappy that ms nortons submission to the democratic platform draft omits mention of statehood were as ready for statehood as everyone else in the us who already lives in a state
6203871 unlike the 2004 democratic platform the 2008 draft doesnt even endorse democratic self government the draft says we deserve the benefits of full citizenship especially the vote that are accorded to citizens of every state without explaining what these things mean or how theyre to be achieved its like saying every child deserves to be educated but refusing to endorse public schools especially the vote is even more ambiguous we already have the right to vote for president for our local elected officials and for our nonvoting delegate to the house but were still being under the boot of congress
6203872 talking points quotes on dc voting rights bill dc statehood and democracy
6203873 we support statehood for the district of columbia the residents of d c must have the same rights and representation as all other us citizens
6203874 our civil rights leaders sacrificed too much over the years for us to tolerate denial to the nearly 600 000 residents of our nations capital of the benefits of full citizenship especially the vote that are accorded to citizens of every state
6203875 as we encourage democracy around the world we must extend democracy here at home we support equal rights to democratic self government and congressional representation for the citizens of our nations capital

6203923 werent interfering with tv channels which is sort of our point
6203924 these mics were broadcasting at much higher volumes than a broadband device would with no interference
6203925 although other devices have apparently been operating in their bands for years broadcasters have not objected to the very scenario they claim would justify prohibiting personal portable white space operations
6203926 broadcasters have for years acquiesced to these types of co channel operations
6203927 in our view theres a huge difference between wireless microphones and the unlicensed white space devices proposed by google and microsoft
6203928 by contrast the proposed white space devices would be mass produced and potentially operated by millions of untrained consumers in unlimited locations
6203929 hence under this scenario we believe the interference implications and threat to clear television pictures would increase exponentially
6203930 it may be the beginning of a trend but it may also be a bad sign

6203954 if a building can contribute just a 5 increase in worker productivity that increase goes a long way toward the building actually paying for itself

6204474 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6204475 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6204476 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6204477 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6204478 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6204479 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6204481 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6204482 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6204483 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6204484 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6204485 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6204486 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6204487 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6204488 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6204489 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6204490 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6204491 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6204492 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6204493 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6204494 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6204495 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6204496 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6204497 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6204498 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6204499 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6204500 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6204501 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6204502 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6204503 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6204504 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6204505 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6204506 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6204507 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6204509 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6204510 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6204511 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6204512 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6204513 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6204514 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6204515 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6204516 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6204519 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6204520 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6204521 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6204522 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6204523 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6204524 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6204525 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6204526 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6204527 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6204528 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6204529 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6204530 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6204531 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6204532 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6204533 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6204534 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6204535 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6204536 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6204537 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6204538 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6204539 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6204540 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6204541 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6204542 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6204543 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6204544 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6204545 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6204546 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6204547 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6204548 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6204549 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6204550 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6204551 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6204552 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6204553 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6204554 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6204555 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6204556 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6204557 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6204558 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6204559 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6204560 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6204561 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6204562 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6204563 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6204564 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6204565 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6204583 joe liebermans a united states senator and hes been very solid on the issue of terrorism

6204586 senator what role would you play in a mccain administration
6204587 im going to be a senator because i love it
6204588 where did this come from i thought this had long been put to bed
6204589 but i honestly dont think that joe lieberman will be the vice presidential choice
6204590 i dont think it would help mccain win the election but id like to see it happen
6204591 mccain is already on the fence with the republican base

6204669 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6204670 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6204671 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6204672 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6204673 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6204674 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6204675 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6204676 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6204677 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6204678 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6204679 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6204680 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6204681 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6204682 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6204683 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6204684 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6204685 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6204686 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6204687 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6204688 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6204689 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6204690 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6204691 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6204723 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6204724 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6204725 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6204726 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6204727 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6204753 there are a number of people still frustrated that sen hillary clinton d ny got a bad deal this year

6204775 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6204776 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6204777 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today

6204811 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6204812 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6204813 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6204814 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6204815 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6204816 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6204817 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6204818 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6204819 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6204820 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6204821 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6204822 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6204823 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6204824 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6204825 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6204826 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

6204830 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6204831 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6204832 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6204833 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6204834 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6204835 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6204836 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6204837 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6204838 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6204839 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6204840 it is very important that we ensure the public has a reasonable amount of time to provide input on our proposed changes to school board governance
6204841 because of vacations and summer schedules we decided our deadline may be difficult for some groups and individuals to meet

6204846 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6204847 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6204848 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
6204849 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease

6204853 the way we have the plan set up it will keep your rate increase down in 2010 and 11 to 5 percent in each of those years
6204854 the plan at this point is that customers would begin paying 8 percent more for their electric this year 8 percent more next year and then all those payments would be applied to their bills in 2010
6204855 i voted yes for the plan but i voted for the plan because something is better than nothing
6204856 but im very disappointed that we dont have more meaningful solutions on the table
6204857 if theyre having trouble paying their bills now being asked to pay a little extra now to help smooth out the rate increase is just not going to work for them
6204858 were just waiting for the legislature and the puc to let us know what parameters theyd like to see in place

6204860 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6204861 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6204862 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6204863 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6204864 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6204865 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6204866 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6204867 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6204868 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6204869 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6204870 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6204871 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6204872 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6204873 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6204874 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6204875 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6204876 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6204877 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6204878 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6204879 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6204880 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6204881 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6204882 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6204883 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6204884 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6204885 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6204886 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6204887 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6204888 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6204889 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6204890 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6204891 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6204892 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6204893 we started the game well but got too complacent and it backfired when aho made the mistake
6204894 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6204895 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6204896 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6204897 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6204898 as far as records management systems go theres nothing out there has never been anything and this is groundbreaking with respect to providing that kind of information to police officers everywhere
6204899 the pip portal sits among all participants acting as an information search engine and request broker individual agencies decide what information they want to make available to other law enforcement agencies while retaining ownership of the data the portal contains only an index of information and not the contents of an electronic record
6204900 its more about having record management systems that can speak to each other
6204901 when it comes to sharing of information its always a challenge to try and put something together that will serve the needs nationally weve worked with a number of agencies across canada to try and make that happen and in fact it has happened
6204902 weve had cpic for 35 years but it deals more with the hard facts such as if there is a warrant for arrest for a person or if there is a court appearanceb amp there may not be any charges at all
6204903 is the 95 per cent of the data that wasnt being shared
6204904 cpic is not about the same thingb amp thats information thats put on there by police agenciesb amp as a result of some kind of action if you will whereas records management systems are about all the information that police officers collect in the course of a day
6204905 pip is really targeted to help the front line officer and the investigator know who they are dealing with
6204906 you have everything from very sophisticated offenders who move from one jurisdiction to another to avoid detection or you may get a predator operating in a large geographic area and you want to know what everyone else knowsb amp there may be a situation where one police agency has him stopped for one thing and another police agency has information on him for a completely different thing but when you put it all together it helps the investigator connect the dots it could be everything from organized crime to terrorism

6204915 the device did not operate in terms of transmitting a signal because it found that particular channel was occupied
6204916 there would be zero chance of causing any interference to the signals because in that situation there certainly would not be a transmission of the signal in the first place

6204926 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6204927 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6204928 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6204929 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6204937 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6204938 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6204939 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6204940 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6204941 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6204942 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6204943 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6204944 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6204945 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6204946 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

6204978 food thats contaminated with listeria doesnt always look like its spoiled and the bacteria can also proliferate when its in the fridge

6205026 the valencia street course is new to formula one so this will present many challenges for the teams for bridgestone we have evaluated the track layout and surface and we will bring the softest tyres in our compound range the soft and super soft this is a street course with many corners although we expect quite high speeds to be attained over the course of a lap as with any street course we expect the grip levels from the circuit to improve over the course of the weekend in valencia in august we should see quite high temperatures so teams will have to be vigilant with their tyre management as we have not raced here previously this should be a learning process for everyone involved and strategy decisions over the race weekend will be interesting

6205029 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6205030 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

6205062 when you put all of the information together there is no evidence that statins increase the risk of cancer
6205063 this study should reassure those taking statins that they are not increasing their risk of cancer by trying to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease
6205064 statin therapy despite producing marked reductions in ldl cholesterol is not associated with an increased risk of cancer

6205066 problem property is a property where enforcement action has been repeatedly taken against a found negligent owner of any residential property
6205067 thats what all the wrestling was about not to handcuff the borough and still relieve the anxiety of people living in redevelopment areas
6205068 without the threat of eminent domain the whole borough should be a redevelopment zone
6205069 we need to get areas redeveloped and that is progressing
6205070 it will serve the purpose that were all looking for with that extra paragraph it leaves the borough able to deal with problem properties and also deals with the eminent domain issue
6205071 it is very comforting to see the whole come together to resolve an issue thats been outstanding for several years
6205072 the city prefers to acquire the property through mutually accepted agreement
6205073 however if it is unable to reach a negotiated agreement with the owner at the aforementioned fair market value the city is authorized by law to resort to statutory condemnation proceedings we trust the aforesaid offer of compensation will be acceptable in lieu of condemnation proceedings
6205074 if they do not cooperate this is what could happen
6205075 it never even got to the point that we would invoke
6205076 we cant be afraid to use whatever resources we can to move along the project

6205088 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6205089 will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6205090 a manned plane is sitting on a conveyor belt which has the ability to instantaneously match the speed of the plane but in the opposite direction when the plane throttles up will it be held in place or will it take off
6205091 and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions
6205092 held in place is in reference to the ground its really just simple english and sentence structure but you apparently dont get it this holds true with every version of the myth that has been presented here

6205094 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the frontcourt while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players
6205095 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6205096 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6205097 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6205098 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6205099 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us

6205117 in his campaign four years ago mitch daniels promised to keep our indiana tax dollars here to create jobs for hoosiers however as governor he has done exactly the opposite privatizing and outsourcing billions of dollars worth of work to foreign and out of state companies
6205118 mitch daniels has repeatedly entered into long term contracts without thinking about the impact on our citizens or the states economy and the results have been disastrous
6205119 mitch daniels policies have short changed taxpayers and compromised the safety security and welfare of our citizens while the private companies that were awarded these contacts make huge profits off of our tax dollars
6205120 i believe that money should stay right here in indiana and as governor i will fight to make sure that finally happens
6205121 the governor likes to tell us that privatization saves money or creates efficiencies but to date weve never seen any proof of that
6205122 what we have seen is dismal upkeep of state property poor customer service unnecessary denial of essential services a riot at the new castle prison and the federal government stepping in to halt the rollout of a privatized program
6205123 clearly its time that hoosiers take a serious look at these contracts and the performance of each of these vendors and thats what this group will do
6205124 we will examine all of the contracts the daniels administration has gotten us into and look for ways in which we can better hold these vendors accountable for the service or for ways to cancel agreements that just dont make sense for the state of indiana
6205125 that means we are going to work to create a government that includes everyone and works for everyone that means we are going to use the resources of state government to create economic opportunities right here in indiana we are going to build a government whose main objective will be improving the lives of our citizens instead of making a profit off the backs of working families

6205147 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6205148 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6205149 we take full responsibility and accept the penalties nascar has levied against us today
6205150 we are however disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6205151 they attempted to cheat in the next two seasons by doing what they did in that dyno test
6205152 its worse than cheating in that one race they attempted to cheat for the next whatever session that was going to be before the next dyno session before nascar could prove it
6205153 i almost wish they were just cheating in that one race because i would have felt better about it but what they attempted to do was cheat us for the rest of the season all the way up to probably atlanta of next year before another dyno test was done thats what makes it even worse

6205170 bij god waarde heren en ridders we hebben deze dag wonderen gezien maar ik vermoed dat we voor de avond nog grotere wonderen zullen zien
6205171 sir ik breng u hier een jonge ridder die van koninklijk bloed is en van het geslacht van jozef van arimathea door wie de wonderen van dit hof en van vreemde koninkrijken volledig vervuld zullen worden
6205172 sir u bent van harte welkom en deze jonge ridder met u
6205173 dit is de zetel van sir galahad de hoge prins
6205174 u kunt nu gaan sir want u hebt gedaan wat u was opgedragen en beveel mij aan bij mijn grootvader koning pelleas en bij mijn heer de visserskoning en zeg hem namens mij dat ik hem zal bezoeken zo snel ik kan
6205175 dit is hij die de heilige graal zal verwerven want niemand anders kon hier zitten of het zou hem slecht vergaan
6205176 bij mijn hoofd deze jonge ridder zal grote roem verwerven
6205177 dat sir lancelot hem verwekte bij koning pelleas dochter die hem door een betovering bij haar deed liggen en zijn naam is galahad ik zou hem graag willen zien
6205178 want hij moet wel een edel man zijn zoals zijn vader die hem verwekte dat kan heel de ronde tafel getuigen
6205179 beste neef nu hebben wij sir galahad onder ons de goede ridder die ons allen eer zal aandoen en zowaar ik leef zal hij de heilige graal verwerven net zoals sir lancelot ons heeft gezegd
6205180 sir u bent van harte welkom want u zult vele goede ridders tot de queeste van de heilige graal bewegen en u zal lukken wat vele andere ridders niet tot een eind zullen brengen
6205181 hier is een wonder zo groot als ik ooit zag en waarlijk goede ridders hebben het beproefd en gefaald
6205182 dat is geen wonder want dit is niet hun avontuur maar het mijne en omdat ik zeker was van dit zwaard bracht ik er geen met mij maar slechts de schede die aan mijn zij hangt
6205183 nu heb ik het zwaard dat eens van de goede ridder balin de wilde was en hij was een voortreffelijke ridder door zijn kracht en met dit zwaard doodde hij zijn broeder balan en dat was heel spijtig want hij was een goede ridder en zij brachten elkaar om vanwege de betreurenswaardige slag die balin koning pelleas gaf die nog niet is geheeld noch ooit zal helen totdat ik hem zal genezen
6205184 ach sir lancelot hoe is uw grote staat veranderd sinds vanmorgen
6205185 want vanochtend was u de beste ridder van de wereld maar wie dat nu zou zeggen zou een leugenaar zijn want er is er nu n beter dan u en dat is wel bewezen door het avontuur met het zwaard waar u uw hand niet aan durfde te slaan en dat is er veranderd aan uw naam en uw staat daarom breng ik u in herinnering dat u van nu af niet moet denken dat u de beste ridder van de wereld bent
6205186 ik besef heel goed dat ik nooit n van de besten was
6205187 dat was u en dat bent u nog van alle zondige mannen op de wereld en sire nacien de kluizenaar laat u zeggen dat u de grootste eer te beurt zal vallen die ooit een koning in brittanni te beurt viel en dit is waarom want vandaag zal de heilige graal in uw huis verschijnen en u en heel het genootschap van de ronde tafel spijzigen
6205188 op deze queeste van de heilige graal zult u van de ronde tafel allen vertrekken en ik weet dat ik u nooit meer allen samen zal zien daarom wil ik u nog n keer samen in het veld zien allen bijeen in het veld bij camelot wil ik u nog n keer allen bijeen zien voor een steekspel en een toernooi opdat na uw dood mensen erover zullen spreken dat hier ooit op deze dag zulke goede ridders bijeen waren

6205207 reneau the only person inside the store and who carried a weapon alone made the decision to take keerans life mr wood was outside the store in his brothers truck
6205208 the state argued that he was responsible for keerans murder and portrayed wood as little more than a sap steamrolled by the villainous reneau
6205209 asked on death row last week to identify the shooter reneau had a one word reply me
6205210 prosecutors reversed their strategy arguing that wood deserved to die because hed gotten reneau to do his dirty work
6205211 bowing to mr woods emotional and irrational insistence mr woods appointed lawyers declined to cross examine any witnesses or present any evidence on mr woods behalf
6205212 not only did woods defense withhold from the jury evidence of his troubled youth but they also failed to cross examine any state witnesses including the wildly speculative testimony of dr james grigson derisively known by many including colleagues in the psychiatric community as dr death for predictably offering testimony in capital cases that a defendant would pose a danger to society one of the questions a jury must decide in order to impose a death sentence
6205213 this can mean sentencing someone to death even if he or she had no proven role in a murder
6205214 if in the attempt to carry out a conspiracy to commit one felony another felony is committed by one of the conspirators all conspirators are guilty of the felony actually committed though having no intent to commit it
6205215 conspiracy in fosters case the robberies for which he was the getaway driver would lead to a murder
6205216 they hate on my dad because they say he should have known better are they following the law to the letter or the letter to the law
6205217 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
6205218 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
6205219 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
6205220 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
6205221 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children

6205227 i wanted a ten cow wife so i paid that for her and treated her as a ten cow wife should be treated when she talked to the other women in the village as women do talk and the subject came around to how much each of their husbands had paid for their bride she came to find out that she was worth more than any other woman in all the villages and she began to believe that she was a ten cow wife

6205237 hey fat fuck did you actually see your toes this morning im sure glad i dont get out of breath from getting dressed
6205238 ik wist niet dat jij tegenwoordig met je kut kon praten
6205239 issut wel een nederlander want van niet nederlanders koop ik geen kunst
6205240 maar is hij wel een geboren amsterdammer want van niet geboren amsterdammers koop ik geen kunst
6205241 hij is niet geboren in amsterdam maar kwam vanaf zijn eerste levensjaar naar amsterdam
6205242 daar heb je het al dat dacht ik al aan het werk te zien
6205243 euhh even natellen precies 43 net geworden 30 okt 1985
6205244 dus niet bepaald een jonge vent maar een ouwe lul
6205245 het is wel een vent die zich nog erg jong moet voelen dat kun je aan dat soort schilderijen wel zien zon jonge ietwat jolige sfeer straalt er toch wel vanaf ik koop eigenlijk nooit van die vrolijke schilde rijen ik zie meer in francis bacon alleen is die zo duur tegenwoordig zes miljoen gulden voor een schilderij ik zou dat wel kunnen betalen als ik dat wilde maar ik wil niet ik betaal niet meer dan dui zend gulden voor een schilderij dat is mijn principe
6205246 ik ga al die takkenbossen volgende week bij de contraprestatie inleveren krijg ik zeker veertigdui zend gulden per stuk voor
6205247 het probleem is dat ik uw werk niet echt mooi kan vinden weet u die nieuwe wilden dat is echt mooi geschilderd maar dit heeft niets met de geest van de tijd te maken hier gaat toch helemaal geen kracht van uit weet u ik mis bij u het vitalisme de universele zeggingskracht en het grote gebaar van de werkelijk getalenteerden die het onzichtbare zichtbaar en het zichtbare onzichtbaar willen maken
6205248 maar ik vind u werk dan wel kunstig hoor maar niet bepaald kunst met een grote ka
6205249 daar is wat mij betreft dan ook alles mee gezegd
6205250 en toch was het een hele warme augustusmiddag toen ik de dias voor de schilderijen nam in zand voort
6205251 het is zeker allemaal met van die goedkope kut acrylverf geschilderd
6205252 als ik het acryl vind dan is het ook acryl ik heb niet voor niks vijf jaar op de akademie gezeten
6205253 wat er bepaald wordt bepaal ik zelf met mijn eigen bepaalde paal
6205254 jongen wat lul je nou ik heb op de akademie les gehad van jacob kuiper en die is getrouwd met een dochter van jan sluyters een betere leermeester is er niet die stemt partij van de arbeid
6205255 talent verkrijgt men niet door een huwelijk of door het stemmen op een politieke partij
6205256 je er niet aan af kan zien dat het nederlands realisme is
6205257 als jij het net zo zakelijk had aangepakt als ik zou je nu ook zo wonen
6205258 e n keer ben ik met een vrouw naar bed geweest en dat was heel opwindend maar ik geef toch de voorkeur aan mannen
6205259 joost lag in bed met een vriendin dat was heel normaal bij ons daar keek ik echt niet van op hoor dat kwam zo vaak voor ik bracht ze vaak koffie op bed om bij te komen en dan praatten we wat bij het heeft me nooit veel kunnen schelen als joost een ander neukte hij wilde een tijd geleden plotseling heel vaak naar de hoeren ga dan naar de hoeren zei ik maar lul er niet zo veel over het lijkt wel alsof je eigenlijk niet wilt anders zou je er niet zoveel over lullen doe het of doe het niet man je hebt geld genoeg om tien keer op een dag naar de hoeren te gaan ga als je zo nodig moet mij maakt het al lang niks meer uit toen hij terug kwam was ik best wel nieuwsgierig en ik vroeg hoe was het bij de hoer en hij kwam met zon raar verhaal dat ik dacht is het wel waar wat hij allemaal vertelt volgens hem kwam hij bij een hoer op het oude kerksplein binnen en die zei gelijk tegen hem stop m dr in ik ben zo geil
6205260 nee die heeft hij niet in zijn binnenzak hij heeft een kleine diplomatenkoffer het lijkt heel officieel voor zijn werk die neemt hij overal mee naar toe maar daar zit niets in dat een diplomaat nodig heeft maar wel vol met tepelklemmen zweepjes riemen en kettingen jarretelles slipjes bustehouders dildos en vibrators
6205261 in ieder geval moest joost met die kaars te keer gaan in dat mens en haar een paar verchroomde zware amerikaanse tepelklemmen aan zetten hij vindt dat nu eenmaal leuk zulke buitenschoolse aktiviteiten
6205262 mila heeft een prima oog voor mannen die super kunnen neuken en daar hoor jij niet bij
6205263 jahaha als je het mystiek wil zien of het is gewoon instinct iedere man stinkt er tot nu toe in ik trek nu eenmaal altijd een beetje verknipte beschadigde zielige lullige mannen uit de goot aan die met echtelijke problemen of zwaar in de financi le moeilijkheden zitten en die wil ik dan voor ze oplos sen maar dan wordt het altijd neuken heel vaak loopt het allemaal verkeerd af verschillende hebben na afloop wel een zelfmoordpoging gedaan meestal mislukte dat maar bij een jongen is het laatst nog gelukt ook er was helemaal niets aan de hand het ging lekker tussen ons vooral in bed voor de rest niet voor de rest gaat het eigenlijk nooit goed ik ging even een uurtje weg boodschappen doen z es flesjes grolsch gehaald en een flink stuk rooie libanon dus de dag kon niet meer stuk kom ik met een prima humeur thuis en ja hoor daar hing meneer doodleuk te bengelen met zijn strot aan een stuk van mijn nieuwe waslijn in het trapportaal nou die waslijn kon ik gelijk ook niet meer gebruiken want dat doe je niet als normaal mens
6205264 nou niks toen want er was geen toen meer voor die jongen die had zijn toen al gehad die zijn toe komst was voor goed verleden tijd het had allemaal toch niet direkt haast hij was al morsdood paars met zijn tong uit zijn bek dus ik ben eerst een stick gaan roken om bij te komen dat had jij toch ook gedaan in mijn geval of niet soms het vreemde was dat hij daar hing met een stijve lul waarvoor dat nou nodig was zon pretje lijkt het me niet om je bij je strot op te hangen en hij had zijn broek on der gepist en gescheten dat rook je op meters afstand daarna heb ik gewoon de politie gebeld ik was heel kalm ze kwamen met een grote kartonnen doos sneden hem los en kieperden hem zo in die doos ze maakten er nog geintjes over ik heb nog steeds een foto van hem
6205265 ik heb je in de nieuwe spiegelstraat nog een keer gezien met een grote man met een zwarte baard en een kapiteinspet hij was minstens een kop groter dan jij
6205266 weet je nog dat hij in zon rare indiase witte jurk met een kralenketting als student rond liep hij kwam wekelijks bij mij langs om een pijp hasj te roken als ina naar een cursus was hij kwam altijd met die ongebakken slappe deegsliert arie visser die simon vinkenoog adept hij begon al gauw net zo slap dat maffe hippietaaltje na te lullen van simon die akela van dat groepje mafketeliaanse stuff kikkers arie is nou helemaal hooked en jat po ziebundels bij de atheneumboekhandel petra laat hem maar zijn gang gaan omdat hij een gevoelige dichter is en die mogen zoveel jatten als ze willen na afloop van de rooksesies zette ik altijd de ramen wijd open om de hasjdampen te laten vervliegen ina had een hekel aan hasjrokers ik eigenlijk ook maar je moest als kunstschilder per slot van rekening ergens bij horen
6205267 wil je het nou nog horen van die vrouw of niet
6205268 ik zette de broodjes en de koffie neer op bed en toen zei joost doe niet zo lullig kom nou ook in bed anders vat je nog kou op je borsten en dan zijn we verder van huis
6205269 ik ging gewoon naast haar liggen kauwde op een bruin puntbroodje en dronk een kopje koffie om een beetje in een sentimental mood te komen
6205270 jahahaha met het woord kruis had het in elk geval wel heel veel te maken maar met puzzelen bepaald niet
6205271 wist je trouwens dat ik nog een abortus heb laten doen als gevolg van een avondje met een haagse post redakteur
6205272 nou ik hoor de hele dag in de drukkerij moeilijke verhalen van moeilijke mensen waarbij nooit iets gemakkelijk gaat of ze hebben stront met hun wijf of met de ambtenarij nooit loopt er bij die artiesten iets echt helemaal jofel altijd zit drwel een haar in hun soep of voelen ze zich miskend of ze komen met onvoorstelbaare moeilijk drukproblemen die ik niet kan oplossen maar waarvan zij bij hoog en laag volhouden dat het toch moet kunnen alhoewel ze dr geen moer verstand van hebben of ze hebben voor de zoveelste keer weer eens geen poen om hun rekening aan mij te kunnen betalen en komt het volgende week met sint juttemis wel en dan wil ik in mijn schaarse vrije tijd weet je wel niet te veel problemen van anderen aan mijn kop hebben weet je wel ik word gewoon goed ziek van die verhalen van bukowski echt ziek
6205273 dan moet je vrouwen van bukowski eens lezen dat is veel minder cru ik heb het net uit achter el kaar uitgelezen en nu is ina het ook aan het lezen
6205274 goed hans een stukje taart hans ik kan je er niet mee laten zitten hans
6205275 en noem me geen freddie hansje anders ga ik onmiddellijk uit bukowski citeren hansje en dan word je pas goed ziek hansje
6205276 vijf en twintig jaar geleden was ik al lang de tel kwijt
6205277 je kon toen nog geen zakje patates of een kop koffie kopen zo arm was je en je was zo ondervoed en wanhopig dat je dank zij je te lage bloeddruk nauwelijks een stijve lul kon fokken
6205278 die bekendheid van mij valt misschien wel heel erg tegen
6205279 dat die bekendheid zonder korte lul misschien erg tegen valt
6205280 nou moet je niet zo raar zitten lullen want iedereen die ik tegenkom kent je ze praten allemaal over je en niet altijd even gunstig maar wel met respekt

6205333 its just the fact that so many people have so many cars you take a rowhouse that used to have one car now they have three cars it has a big impact on the parking situation
6205334 this seems like the most logical solution to our problem ultimately the people in butchers hill will be the ones to decide
6205335 i think its desperately needed we have issues you can spend up to 45 minutes a night parking around here
6205336 its important that we do get a petition where neighbors sign off that they are in support of this request thats when we determine that this area is feasible

6205338 the gay rights activist peter tatchell claims the vatican is promoting
6205339 arguably the most famous convert to catholicism in victorian england newman was originally an anglican clergyman who spearheaded the oxford movement which attempted bring the church of england back to what he viewed as its catholic origins
6205340 newman repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to be buried next to his life long partner ambrose st john no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes the re burial has only one aim in mind to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating catholic church
6205341 now cardinal newmans great friendship with ambrose st john is being slyly suggested as evidence of his being subject to a disordered sexuality the utter absurdity of this idea speaks for itself
6205342 on august 11 this year on the 118th anniversary of the death of newman the government gave permission for the cardinals remains to be transferred from rednal into a sarcophagus that will stand between marble columns opposite the holy souls altar in the oratory church in edgbaston
6205343 there is little doubt that newman and st john were gay and had a loving long term same sex relation ship it is impossible to know whether this relationship involved sex it is conceivable that both men had a gay orientation but chose to abstain from sex abstinence does not alter a persons sexual orientation

6205381 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6205382 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6205383 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
6205384 help from in the form of usable bug reports and responsible time lines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible our vulnerability bulletins will credit responsible reporters of any flaws
6205385 a beta test by any other name is still a beta test
6205386 its a wise practice for google emphasizing that android is going to be solid and stable is important to google particularly because we are seeing a version one release and we know that version one releases come with their own set of challenges
6205387 obviously how apple tests its products and the forum in which it tests its products is somewhat different than what google is doing here

6205393 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
6205394 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u

6205409 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6205410 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6205411 these yopd patients have significant family work and financial responsibilities and they are experiencing non motor symptoms that disrupt their everyday life
6205412 as more and more patients share this kind of information we hope to illuminate the differences between these two types of the disease
6205413 although its too early to say what might be causing these differences we would suggest that neurologists need to pay more attention to the non motor symptoms in young onset pd patients as they might appear more often than in more typical pd

6205422 the officers and board of directors are the determining bodies on the interpretation of the rules and regulation with all decisions being final
6205423 the officers and board members need not converse or otherwise meet with anyone unless the meetings are civil and respectful nor will anyone be expected to respond to persons who are harassing intimidating and or threatening
6205424 you might walk on someone elses garden or walk on the wrong paths
6205425 it has to be one of the officers of the board
6205426 well because they we its its the boards thing thats thats what they would do its not for our members to do
6205427 ill drive you back out i dont want to get in trouble
6205428 you know why because youre a fake and a fraud and an imposter
6205429 if anything goes missing you will be blamed for it and you will pay a 300 fine

6205446 essendo in grave carenza di risorse la lega pone il problema di cominciare a considerare anche quelle aree in cui in autostrada si viaggia gratis in alcune zone non ha senso che si viaggi gratuitamente
6205447 non mi faccia entrare nel particolare risponde castelli perch queste notizie bisogna darle un po alla volta altrimenti salta fuori un caos diciamo che un tema che bisogna cominciare a porsi sono perfettamente in sintonia con il ministro matteoli che dice che ormai di infrastrutture a spese esclusivamente dello stato non se ne possono pi fare vengono costruite in project financing e quindi esigono un pedaggio
6205448 visto che c una grave carenza di risorse bisogna andare a prenderle dove ci sono ormai prosegue castelli nellintervista ci sono aree dove la gente pu tranquillamente permettersi di pagare il pedaggio e siccome sono opere che costano enormemente credo che un contributo da parte di chi le usa sia giusto
6205449 ci sono grossi problemi legati alla presenza asfissiante della mafia che effettivamente rende difficile la vita a quelle aziende che vogliono operare senza sottostare ai taglieggiamenti
6205450 i milanesi pagano la tangenziale i romani invece non pagano il raccordo anulare
6205451 condivido pienamente le parole del ministro altero matteoli spiega all ansa castelli impensabile finanziarie le infrastrutture con denaro pubblico non pagare il pedaggio divenuto un privilegio anacronistico che il paese non si pu pi permettere inoltre per la realizzazione delle opere previsto il project financing e questo presuppone il pagamento del pedaggio
6205452 un tema sul tappeto ineludibile abbiamo allo studio varie soluzioni
6205453 assolutamente esclusa lidea che si possa pagare il pedaggio sul gra il sottosegretario castelli non conosce gli esatti termini della questione infatti il gra che gestito dallanas e non dalle autostrade ha da sempre avuto una funzione di unico collegamento urbano tra le diverse vie consolari e di conseguenza non pu essere considerata unautostrada dallutilizzo facoltativo e quindi sottoponibile a pedaggio

6205476 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6205477 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve

6205487 if men are not funny then they are thought of as just being not funny where as if you are a woman and youre not funny its because you are a women
6205488 i did a big show before the festival in front of 1 300 people in ealing and it was a typical lager fuelled friday humour crowd so when i came on they heckled me and the men kept talking to each other and ignoring me but finally i won them round

6205490 i was so excited when i found out and was stunned
6205491 i will be nervous on the night but its just amazing to be shortlisted and we are all very different comedians so its is very important to keep in mind that whomever wins its not a reflection on the others
6205492 it was getting to the end of the decade and people were saying are women just not funny as for years they havent been on the shortlist

6205497 in terms of the outlook for the current financial year the board is of the view that the short term macro economic conditions in new zealand and internationally remain challenging

6205500 i think in respect of georgia its very significant that in may nato committed not just to georgia but also to the ukraine that they would join other formerly so called captive states of the former warsaw pact in nato and what were going to agree today is a special mechanism that will bind nato and georgia together a nato and georgia commission that will take forward that commitment to georgian membership
6205501 we must make clear that georgias aspiration to be a member of nato remains alive and well the alliance should offer georgia a clear pathway to membership

6205614 there was around 35 000 people in the stadium and more watching on tv i really enjoyed it i also got to go along to wrestlemania which was mind blowing because i got to chat one on one with some big names like triple h he was a really down to earth guy and it was great to meet him because he is one of my heroes hes also built very big like me and gave me plenty of good advice i know its going to take time to get there but im determined to make it in wwe

6205616 amanta prietenului lui videanu s a culcat cu mine stiind ca are sida
6205617 in timp ce era amanta lui beyer prietenul lui adriean videanu ea s a culcat si cu mine stiind ca are sida
6205618 o stiu din 2006 nu mi a spus ca are sida am aflat intamplator dupa ce am intretinut de mai multe ori raporturi sexuale cu ea totul a plecat dupa ce m a imbolnavit de sifilis a recunoscut intr un tarziu ca a fost depistata si cu hiv de cand am aflat asta traiesc un cosmar sunt nevoit sa fac analize periodice ceea ce m a adus intr o stare cumplita de stres
6205619 am pierdut tot acum vreau sa se faca dreptate ca nu cumva si alti barbati sa pateasca ce am patit eu
6205620 anul acesta am avut mult de furca cu locuitorii din auckland care doreau ca autoritatile sa nu ne mai acorde aprobare pentru ineditul nostru miting am fost tarat luni bune prin tribunale dar am biruit judecatorul nicola mathers a respins solicitarea grupului de 1 000 de pudici care voiau sa ne vaduveasca de un spectacol pe cinste
6205621 judecatorul a avut dreptate in fond nu facem decat sa expunem niste sani iar legea din noua zeelanda le permite femeilor sa isi arate bustul gol in public daca vor la fel ca si barbatii
6205622 de la dorinta la infaptuire este drum lung daca se va intampla va voi spune
6205623 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6205624 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6205625 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6205626 i have been a dolly fan all of my life shes a wonderful woman i really connect with her music i cant think of a better role model for my children
6205627 she has this great sweet personality but shes also strong and wise
6205628 what we are going to do is have tom get his knee cleaned up a little bit more preventative than anything else
6205629 hopefully its nothing serious and can alleviate some of the swelling and the pain and hopefully he is ready to go by the first game
6205630 its 150 million the companies that we invest in are stage agnostic which means they can be napkins they can be pre ipos they can be anything in between the range of the first round is typically somewhere from 500 000 to 3 or 4 million the fund itself is co managed by rbc venture partners and jla venture partners its a traditional venture fund so it is not grants its not like the facebook allocations where guys walk in to a giant atm they get 250 000 and go off to do their thing its not that at all its one of the key messages that probably isnt getting out there as well as id like it to
6205631 personally im hopeful that some developers are going to take a giant step backwards get in a nice easy chair put their feet up and say okay lets pretend that weve got a blank sheet of paper and lets pretend that the device is going to have unlimited bandwidth unlimited memory and an amazing functional keyboard and be a functional device that people will just love and carry with them everywhere
6205632 the limited partners rbc which is first and foremost a bank and its a big bank and its a big financial services institution there is incredible value for guys doing mobile applications to find out that their mobile applications dont work in an enterprise environment you also look at thompson reuters thompson reuters is a huge huge media conglomerate and services organization so when youre doing things and your application is about rendering content and looking at ways to deliver content and better ways to get feedback from people using your content there isnt any better player in the world than thompson reuters to start talking to about those applications and services you have research in motion which is a limited partner naturally theres a big wall that is up and says you dont get a vote theyre just a limited partner so theyre not telling us what to invest in what not to invest in theyre independent and hands off when it comes to that thats not to say we dont pick up the phone and say to them were looking at a company in this particular space what do you think then of course you have us jla as a limited partner and also as a co manager with rbc tech ventures were just nice venture capital guys that know how that whole process works we have lots of our own rolodex people and weve got lots of experience and we already have investments in things like quickplay and blog networks so weve been around the block the block a little bit
6205633 you have to remember one very important thing about venture capital at the end of the day its all about the money there shouldnt be any misunderstanding if there is an amazing opportunity that was an amazing game changing thing for the mobile space and it required lots of money i would sit down with the ifund in a heartbeat some of the mainstream press guys love to create controversy where none exists like the ifund vs the blackberry fund vs the facebook fund vs the starbucks fund vs the macdonalds fund surprise all of the people that are doing this have everything in common its called greed i guarantee if go back and you take a look at whats going on over at the ifund youll find the dramatic draconian you have to do it this way it can only be for this etc all those requirements are gone the reason those requirements are gone is because the guys running that fund are greedy just like me i believe the right thing to do is to get super good at what you do from solving a particular problem in the mobile space and get it out on as many platforms and to as many customers as possible naturally we want and expect blackberry devices to be an integral part of that business plan because its all about the money
6205634 but it was awful for me to to go through it
6205635 ahaha do you remember when you did said this completely mental thing that was delusional embarrassing explicit scary etc
6205636 the existing stream bank has been impacted by use which is why its distance is less

6205638 two national polls are out today with different pictures of the race although neither of them are particularly good news for barack obama there has also been a series of state polls in the last two days which showed the democrat having difficulty gaining any ground
6205639 a reuters zogby poll conducted aug 14 17 has mccain moving out front 46 percent to 41 percent with 13 percent undecided the margin of error is 3 points last month obama had led by 7 points
6205640 these two polls come on the heels of yesterdays los angeles times bloomberg survey that had obama and mccain in a statistical tie with obama ahead 45 percent to 43 percent in a survey conducted aug 15 18 the margin of error was 3 points
6205641 its important that the elections law focus on elections not on attempting to use this legislation to solve a difficult and much more complicated problem
6205642 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6205643 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6205644 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6205645 are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the is on a weekly basis
6205646 ii voi raspunde si lui tata daca se ia de dinamo
6205647 ii voi raspunde si lui tata daca se va lua vreodata de dinamo nu voi accepta niciodata insulte la adresa echipei mele
6205648 intr adevar am auzit ca domnul taher a ajutat pe dinamo in momente dificile impreuna cu dumitru dragomir si cu mircea lucescu deocamdata eu sunt la dinamo el este la rapid pe mine nu ma amendeaza nimeni doar suporterii ma pot amenda

6205651 what we show in this paper is kind of a big shock we show that brown fat is derived from a muscle like cell and that brown fat and white fat are completely different
6205652 what it means is that muscle cells are precursor cells to brown fat cells
6205653 lo que hemos hecho nosotros es viabilizar el camino que esto se discuta r pidamente en el pleno y en su momento se pronunciar entonces el parlamento tiene su independencia es aut nomo y por eso es que hemos tomado esta decisi n
6205654 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6205655 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this

6205657 are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the is on a weekly basis
6205658 one can see that barack obama was already starting to think about issues of poverty and race in a political context
6205659 he mentions the race card rev wright his absent father and his white grandmother all issues that would become oh so relevant here in 2008 it was also rather tragic to hear him mention his mother since we know she would succumb to ovarian cancer later that year
6205660 fascinating to see how many themes remain the same and how even at that young age obama seems preternaturally composed its also striking to me given how so many have raised questions about his membership in tucc that his determination to confront racial polarization and his cultural centrism as well as liberal politics have always been front and center
6205661 and a great warrior from an unknown village will save the world from the great evil

6205671 i hope that there are not people in russia who are hankering for the days of u s soviet confrontation because they are over
6205672 what the secretary general was referring to is fulminating about how youre going to attack poland because there are 10 interceptors aimed at long range threats of the future from countries like iran when youve been offered all kinds of measures to demonstrate
6205673 they russia must know that the united states would never permit an attack on the territory of an ally under article 5

6205675 with apple shapes where people tend to have large waists with skinny legs and hips the risk of high cholesterol and heart disease is higher what weve found is that the fat tissue that lines the abdomen the adipose fat is high in the inflammatory markers that lead to heart and cholesterol problems
6205676 as women age their cholesterol profile changes because as estrogen levels go down the hdl or good cholesterol also goes down and the ldl or the bad cholesterol goes up
6205677 in men the low testosterone levels that sometimes occur in 50s and 60s can increase the risk for heart disease pre diabetes and insulin resistance
6205678 during this time we also see an increase in abdominal fat so its actually the opposite of women where we see a decrease in estrogen causing an increase in adipose fat
6205679 nu stiu daca mai am sau nu capace dar daca ziceti voi va cred
6205680 she was really kind to me i didnt really talk to many of the people on bobby but lindsay and i got along really well then when they were struggling to find the character to play opposite her in i know who killed me lindsay suggested me i met with the producers and got the part it seemed to be a pretty good role and the cast was great but lindsay was going through a lot of personal things in the media and there was a lot of pressure on her shes a tremendous talent but she was very young and she was basically carrying this multi million movie ive got nothing bad to say about lindsay she helped me buy my house

6205710 we believed so far that they have used technology minimally to reduce chances of getting caught however the accused from vadodara have told us that some of the details used in the written material were typed on the computer and the formula for making bombs was carried in a storage device

6205730 en momentos en que suben los precios de la energ a el ctrica el agua potable la bencina y los alimentos a m me parece grave que aparezca la c mara aunque sea legal o tradicional aument ndose esta asignaci n pese a que los diputados trabajen mucho creo que se deben dar se ales concretas y eso significa no subir estos recursos
6205731 eso extenderse a todos los sueldos altos de la administraci n p blica de ministros subsecretarios intendentes o parlamentarios ya que hemos llegado a un nivel de diferencia en la escala de salarios muy grande y abismante
6205732 hay una diferencia de 20 veces en los sueldos de un secretario de estado o parlamentario con un funcionario p blico grado 24 28 que saca 130 140 mil pesos mensuales creo que es el momento de dar se ales en el pa s y por eso digo no a esta asignaci n

6205750 i just dont know how you square the philosophical differences
6205751 im a platform kind of guy and i would encourage the mccain camp to be cognizant of the pro life position for the base and especially for the people who are doing the get out the vote work for us
6205752 but its one of the fundamental foundations of the party i would encourage the mccain camp to be aware of who were going to have working in the vineyards i understand its probably sexy to look at other alternatives and see what they bring to the table but at the same time im a business guy and were talking about customers youve got to have volunteers and the vice presidential pick will be crucial

6205758 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6205759 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6205760 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6205761 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6205762 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6205763 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6205764 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6205765 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed

6205767 la visi n general es que hay varias dimensiones en las que los juegos tienen efectos
6205768 esto significa que los juegos no son buenos o malos sino poderosas herramientas educativas que tienen diversos efectos que podr amos no esperar de ellos
6205769 jugar con videojuegos puede mejorar las habilidades cognitivas y perceptivas
6205770 ciertos tipos de videojuegos pueden tener efectos beneficiosos mejorando la destreza de los jugadores as como su capacidad para resolver problemas atributos que se han mostrado tiles no solo para los estudiantes sino tambi n para los cirujanos
6205771 his length for his position extreme speed proficient ballhandling and superb body control in the lane allow him to make plays most players cant even think about making you also have to love his upside he improved over the summer as a shooter and defender and he also proved that he is a winner and not just a talent
6205772 looking at the impact that great point guards such as steve nash chris paul and derrick rose are having on the game at the pro and college level it only makes sense for wall to be the no 1 prospect
6205773 regardless of where he goes to school id be surprised if he didnt average at least 15 points per game i wouldnt be surprised if he averaged more than 20 points per game he also has the ability to be a lockdown defender
6205774 bradleys defense certainly weighs in heavily in his ranking in its simplest form the game breaks down to scoring and not letting your opposition score bradley has a pretty good handle on dominating his man on both sides of the ball
6205775 snaer simply did it all in vegas and with a competitive attitude that bordered on nasty
6205776 we just hadnt seen that from him we knew he could score but we werent aware of his competitive instinct and his all around game now we know his capabilities
6205777 yarou impressed us out of the gates when we watched him in april
6205778 then when we saw him outplay demarcus cousins on memorial day weekend we knew he was definitely a five star candidate his aggressive post play impressive physique and the athleticism that we saw at the end of the summer in vegas convinced us that he is a five star prospect
6205779 he has exceptional balance explosive athleticism strong hands and a motor that doesnt stop on his rebounding alone he will make a living playing the game but he also has impressive upside as an offensive player
6205780 the kids who know theyre probably going to see only one snap a year they love coming out here and playing the role players know its their job to do certain things whether its being a blocking dummy or whatever they love it because its a great program and everyone loves coach specht
6205781 they want to be a part of something bigger than themselves
6205782 we put a lot of young players at second and third string last year so they got to see a lot of snaps in the games where we were up a lot we have a little experience from that but weve been learning quickly everybody has been stepping up real quick some players were studying playbooks months before practice ever started we were ready to go we knew what we had to do
6205783 the big thing is every one of our players knows what to do every play
6205784 were going to be very disciplined weve got so many good players who just havent had a chance to play we had so many good seniors last year they didnt have a chance to play this year is their shot and theyre going to take advantage of it
6205785 with their experience and what they can give to the young guys they played in all the big games last year they have an edge which they help teach the inexperienced players
6205786 thats tremendous especially when one of them is your linebacker the captain of your defense and one of them is your quarterback the captain of your offense thats very important and weve been real fortunate to have those guys back
6205787 everybody around here thinks i should have my head examined but why do we do this
6205788 our kids are going to improve because of the level of competition thats what were trying to tell the kids whatever you do in life youd better surround yourself with people who are better than you and smarter than you because theyll make you better we play teams from five states this year i dont know how many high schools in the country are playing five states every time i rattle that off i think i might have to have my head examined
6205789 we are super excited to put up this new song vacuity from the way of all flesh

6205797 gregory peck once said that the secret of film acting is complete candour with the audience when you let them see the real you and this perfectly captures the essence of gabriel in his many roles and makes him an ideal choice for this new prestigious award

6205803 its no wonder that the phone companies and their lobbyists have raised and contributed millions to senator mccain
6205804 he has gotten too close to the lobbyists for industries over which he has had regulatory power trust buster teddy roosevelt whom mccain calls a hero would be rolling in his grave

6205807 a dangerous condition was created by water pouring out of a spa shower onto a marble floor located in the spa and salon area of the hotel
6205808 a hotel employee briefly instructed plaintiff in the operation of the shower the shower was so negligently designed and inadequately drained that when plaintiff turned it on the water poured out of the shower area onto the surface of the marble floor outside which guests necessarily had to traverse to enter and exit the shower

6205815 he actually came up to the car that i was in and was complaining and was saying how disgusting it was then he goes and reaches to grab one of the girls and when she pushes him away he punches her in the face

6205824 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
6205825 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
6205826 its about the old west and horses and sheriffs and going and getting the bad guys its not a racist thing or about lynching
6205827 take all the rope in texas find a tall oak tree

6205829 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
6205830 thus saith the lord god it shall also come to pass that at the same time shall things come into thy mind and thou shalt think an evil thought
6205831 and thou shalt say i will go up to the land of unwalled villages i will go to them that are at rest that dwell safely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates
6205832 to take a spoil and to take a prey to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations which have gotten cattle and goods that dwell in the midst of the land

6205838 a hunger that cant be satisfied an anger that cant be settled
6205839 of course this movie is haunted yet again by the wendigo my beloved wendigo which has done untold damage to my career in my endless attempts to portray it
6205840 wendigos are people who have crossed that invisible but fatal barrier that divides the natural from the supernatural north
6205841 savage and formidable potencies lurking behind the souls of men not evil perhaps in themselves yet instinctively hostile to humanity as it exists
6205842 nothing between the earth and sky is bad but there are spirits that should be feared
6205843 closely wedded to the idea of an unseen world constantly pressing on ours
6205844 laws you cannot know legends you cannot believe and a force you cannot fight
6205845 the younger man understood that in a hinterland of this size there might well be depths of wood that would never in the life of the world be known or trodden
6205846 most vulnerable points moreover are said to be the feet and the eyes the feet you see for the lust of wandering and the eyes for the lust of beauty the poor beggar goes at such a dreadful speed that he bleeds beneath the eyes and his feet burn
6205847 its kind of the most traditional version of the wendigo tale
6205848 panic of the wilderness the power of untamed distance the enticement of the desolation that destroys
6205849 very simply i grew up in new england and the winters in vermont visiting family and friends made a deep impression on me got to my soul same with the wendigo
6205850 it can grow tall as the trees and still it aches with hunger
6205851 an eco horror film and a creature film and a ghost story and a cautionary tale
6205852 what if our guilt started manifesting itself in this dark north of the arctic where you imagine you could see things with the northern lights to help you
6205853 but thats always the way when civilized men come into the wilderness theyre all crazy as hell
6205854 were grave robbers theyre coming out of the ground ghosts
6205855 the presentiment of a nameless doom lurked ill concealed behind every detail of what had happened
6205856 he was tough but then a good soldier ought to be
6205857 this country is stretching out its arms and consuming all it can we merely follow
6205858 what i love about the wendigo is that there are so many ways to tell that story
6205859 we learned really early after the wendigo episode dont mount creatures you cant afford to produce theyre just gonna look stupid
6205860 thats it youre just going to leave me hanging like this
6205861 well ok but do you really want to discuss it in this forum
6205862 no its just that i saw you have some frustration
6205863 yeah i could see it some kind of deep frustration like something isnt progressing as it should or isnt going the right way
6205864 sometimes you scare me with how well you read this stuff
6205865 ett jos sit rupeaisi vain pokkana julkaisemaan niin sit v hitellen tottuisikin siihen milt kuulostaa

6205867 nothing inspired me to start a film in the intervening period besides i decided to dabble in television and establish my company
6205868 i was completely disillusioned i took failure to my heart but with the passage of time i realized that one should never take failure to heart or success to head
6205869 its not its a modern day fantasy adventure let me clarify we havent copied the west or the east its an original concept very indian at heart a desi film but presented in a contemporary format
6205870 ive grown up on popular indian cinema and having grown up in a family environment youll see a lot of familial bonding in drona the bonding between jaya aunty jaya bachchan and abhishek on screen is terrific its an extension of what theyre in real life in fact jaya aunty is the trump card of my film the real usp and as a director i must add that its one of her finest works ever

6205880 a number of our players perform consistently well in online events such as the leocop but with limited exposure to live play their successes do not translate well in the live arena it is our hope that this event will be a solution to that problem
6205881 the weekend should give our players the tools and confidence they require to adapt and maximise elements of their online game to suit a live game and ultimately to win

6205899 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6205900 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6205901 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
6205902 help from in the form of usable bug reports and responsible time lines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible our vulnerability bulletins will credit responsible reporters of any flaws
6205903 a beta test by any other name is still a beta test
6205904 its a wise practice for google emphasizing that android is going to be solid and stable is important to google particularly because we are seeing a version one release and we know that version one releases come with their own set of challenges
6205905 obviously how apple tests its products and the forum in which it tests its products is somewhat different than what google is doing here
6205906 how horrible fantastic incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing
6205907 how important wmfe is to the arts community and that we shouldnt be punished for actions we didnt control
6205908 algum dia ter uma volta do nsync eu n o acho que o tempo seja agora talvez em alguns anos pela estrada quando todos j tivermos tido a chance de realizar nossos planos individuais n s nos reuniremos como grupo e faremos mais m sica

6205912 information on the number of people involved is not yet available but spanair is doing everything possible to help the spanish authorities at this difficult time
6205913 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6205914 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
6205915 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your heads to be professional
6205916 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the the world here we are fighting against terrorism
6205917 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6205918 and unless we do that we will continue to suffer

6205920 if you have been diagnosed as dying you have a right to ask questions and a right to have them answered

6205922 what they dont need is another governmental intrusion into the relationship between themselves and their doctor
6205923 its the closest thing to hell ive seen the corpses were boiling everything was burning there was nothing left that resembled a plane it was in pieces its a miracle anyone survived
6205924 i was on the runway and i could see the cloud of smoke the whole field erupted in flames over an area of about 1km square
6205925 the rescue workers couldnt get to the plane because of the fire engulfing the whole fuselage
6205926 this was a fairly elderly aircraft but saying that there are many of them flying
6205927 ive been trying phone them but they just dont answer i just dont know if they were on it
6205928 they were very dear friends and they would have put into effect immediately the full emergency evacuation system if they had been in a position to do so
6205929 we had just landed at barajas and were taxiing to terminal 4 when my wife pointed out a ball of flames at the end of the runway
6205930 at first i thought it was just landing but then i saw that it abruptly changed direction to the right and the wing seemed to hit the ground it seemed to break apart with a large explosion
6205931 i saw it take off and it climbed to about 200 metres when flames appeared in the engine it then crashed to the ground and disappeared from view in a hollow past the end of the runway
6205932 we extend deep condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the crash we stand ready to provide technical assistance
6205933 the cool thing about lifestreaming is you get to gaze into people to learn a lot that you might not otherwise know about them
6205934 you get an idea about whats going with their lives in a way that you dont have to interact but you build all this knowledge and information
6205935 one thing weve discovered is that email is not the perfect medium for every kind of conversation
6205936 if you are sharing funny links of good videos or an interesting article email turns out not to be the best way to share those it can pile up and you start to feel guilty and anxious and not sure if youre ever going to catch up
6205937 there are a lot of us though who find great value in this ongoing noise it helps us get to know people who would otherwise be just acquaintances it makes us feel closer to the people we care for but in whose lives were not able to participate as closely as wed like
6205938 people will become comfortable with the idea of sharing things more often
6205939 part of it is explaining the product to people better
6205940 we hired a summer intern that will be working on a number of videos taking people through what is friendfeed and why it can be relevant to them and how to use it
6205941 we are in an unprecedented phase when all the big companies are racing each other to see who can open up the fastest
6205942 if your mom is hanging out at the same club that youre going to what do you do you find a cooler club
6205943 moms are now on facebook so kids will move on
6205944 we are starting to see a shift where its not really a decision of whether to join you have to decide not to join
6205945 its getting so easy to the point it is ubiquitous
6205946 our second quarter performance is a milestone for salesforce com
6205947 were thinking about the way that we gather information and make it available to investors
6205948 absolutely your starting quarterback has to be ready for the first regular season game
6205949 with the guys that have played as long as he has played you are not quite as concerned about their minutes in the preseason
6205950 now i want him to feel better thats my main concern but as far as not playing or not getting enough reps i dont worry about that too much
6205951 were going to take it a day at a time and just see how he feels
6205952 i felt fine if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much
6205953 were resting this up and treating this thing and well see how it goes
6205954 sayin1 more thing u should call his cell more too just to sya i love u or b4 u go to bed or even when u wake uhp guys llove that
6205955 of course we must think about the safety car for our tactics more than we usually do
6205956 all of those platforms have been part of the discussion but at this point i don t have anything to announce
6205957 there are no approved plans for u s ship involvement at this point
6205958 are we prudently planning yes we have been considering all options
6205959 i am an adult and you are a child and our relationship was wrong
6205960 i cannot express how much admiration i have for these men and women
6205961 it s a kind of suffering and hardship i ve never experienced in my life and never will
6205962 it s not what they teach us about what troops do
6205963 it s the wisdom we learn about the hope the passion i think they have a lot to teach us about humanity
6205964 it s not meant to be school people have a good time it just turns into a really amazing conversation
6205965 the word in the office was that these troops have earned the right to say whatever they wanted to say
6205966 once they re given the opportunity they write phenomenal pieces
6205967 marines who after a couple of beers admit they write poetry
6205968 we re setting up a display in the commissary this saturday from 11 to 3 to explain how the program earns money for our school
6205969 last year we used the money to help fund programs like math night out our science exposition and field day events
6205970 republicans must step out of their ideological corner on the right and democrats must step out of their ideological corner on the left
6205971 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6205972 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6205973 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that
6205974 its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6205975 its his anatomy hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart
6205976 and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see people enjoying themselves having a good time and he recognized the responsibility of seizing the moment and he did it
6205977 i told myself if im going to get this record its going to be here because the track is really fast
6205978 i told myself im going to go out there and give it my all and i went out there and just left everything on the track
6205979 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
6205980 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
6205981 se eu for pensar assim n o fa o nada
6205982 its really raw and unfiltered not run through a committee of 12 people who need to approve what you say its the real deal
6205983 i knew an advertiser would pull out but i think advertisers are beginning to understand that people come to my web site because i do that the reason i have eyeballs is because of my irreverence

6206009 man this isnt the way i wanted to go home with a medal
6206010 i would love to have crossed the line in the third place position because i looked at the replay and i dont feel like it gave spearmon an advantage i feel like he was deserving of the third place position
6206011 i was tall when i was little says bolt in trelawny parish on the north shore of jamaica an hours drive from the vacation resorts of montego bay and ocho rios he loved to play cricket with his friends and if he was talented he was also a little lazy
6206012 good tv poor sportsmanship said nbc analyst and four time olympic
6206013 he realizes that these kind of opportunities dont come along very often
6206014 i told myself im going to leave everything on the track i did just that
6206015 get in his head collins said even before bolt won the 100 meters long time los angeles based track agent
6206016 sprinters are too nice now they need to get in bolts face and intimidate him
6206017 all these other guys have these serious faces says simms
6206018 usain is just laughing and chilling im telling you the guy is just different
6206019 thats the big difference between this race and michael johnsons race said former british olympic sprinter
6206020 michael was under pressure from ato and frankie usain was all alone
6206021 i hear he looked impressive but i didnt really get to see hes 6 foot 5 and he runs like hes 5 9 he ran 9 6 in the 100 celebrating at 70 meters and hes been a 200 400 runner in the past when he got in the 200 meters here you knew he was going to run something very fast
6206022 i was saying i look cool that guy looks fast
6206023 he will play as much as we need to have him play
6206024 the thinking is that kyle has had 42 starts and we have a good idea of what he is and what hes been we need to find out more about troy smith he needs those reps he needs them against a defense in a third preseason game where theyre game planning him a little bit and well see how he does
6206025 no i say that because i am confident in what i can do and what i will do
6206026 obviously being a young player i havent had that much time on the field im very very thankful for the situation and the opportunity and im grateful for everything to come
6206027 anytime passes are in the game plan you want to try to hit them all but nothing is perfect when you get out there on the football field this is still the preseason weve still got a long way to go

6206031 its important now to find compounds that can be used in imaging because the earlier clinicians can detect the disease the better the chances are that a drug will halt disease progression while patients still have strong cognitive abilities
6206032 when we added these compounds to the reaction their interaction with the tau protein inhibited filaments from forming which could be valuable for therapeutics because it would prevent the formation of tau tangles some people think if we clear away the pathology seen in diseased brains that might alleviate symptoms of alzheimers disease

6206041 we are trying our best to come out of this critical situation without any damage to afghanistan and the taliban
6206042 it would be best if the arrest or killing of any hvt high value target were announced on 26 27 or 28 july

6206089 sembrava una serata strana iniziata bene poi loro hanno trovato due gol uno abbastanza fortunosamente poi la voglia di far bene ci ha dato una carica in pi e alla fine potevamo anche vincere e stata una bella partita peccato per il terreno di gioco non proprio regolare noi abbiamo tanti giocatori tecnici ma tutto sommato abbiamo onorato la maglia

6206101 in addition it also helps air force schools maintain enough seats for future training needs
6206102 afpc has the capability to cancel a training line number up to 24 hours prior to class start date wed prefer to have at least 10 duty days advanced notice as this would allow us time to re advertise the opening to the rest of the career field and find another individual to attend

6206122 the amazing race asia is a mega production and we have only been able to create this world world class production because of the faith of our valuable partners many like sony electronics asia pacific caltex nokia and standard chartered bank are long time supporters of asian franchise and we are proud to bring in our new partners singha corporation and maskargo to the race
6206123 america owes the men and women of the vfw a debt that could really never be repaid

6206125 i want to thank the members of the armed forces that are here today
6206126 there is no greater honor than being the commander in chief of the united states military and im proud to be in your presence
6206127 who served in distant lands should have to live without shelter in the land they fought to defend

6206131 all i remember is that i saw the flash and i pulled him to get him out of the way of the blast thats all i remember
6206132 a piece of shrapnel had taken out my seat where i was sitting it probably would have killed me
6206133 i went to disneyland and the cannons starting firing off the ship
6206134 and here i am low crawling across the ground knowing full well that im in disneyland but my bodys reacting
6206135 to get back into the work force and be able to see that i can succeed and that what i wrote down on my resume is true and that i can do it and i have a lot to offer has really decreased stress
6206136 to overcome those obstacles and being able to be out in the work force has really helped emphasize that i can do it and i can succeed
6206137 we cant lose their productivity we cant lose their skills we cant lose their value to society
6206138 these are human beings that deserve the opportunity to continue doing what it is they want to do which is to continue to be productive in society
6206139 an initiative like this is terribly important because if youre going to have one in five veterans coming home with this theyre just not people we can afford to forget or lose
6206140 they didnt forget us they did their job and we cant forget them
6206141 what labor is trying is to do in my judgment is help employers understand that if you support the employee hell perk back up again
6206142 its a bit like being on team with a good coach youve got a good coach that performer somehow finds an extra amount of energy an extra effort america supports you freedom walk
6206143 sometimes were out doing combat patrols in the morning or afternoon and that night we might be doing a raid with the iraqi army to take bad guys off the street

6206148 were keeping the pressure on the enemy and as weve done so weve defended this homeland
6206149 and we owe them something more the tools necessary to be able to do their job
6206150 we have used all these tools to stop new attacks
6206151 and i am pleased to report to the american people that these tools will be available for future administrations to protect the american people for years to come
6206152 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6206153 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6206154 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6206155 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6206156 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6206157 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6206158 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture u s agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6206159 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6206160 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6206161 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done
6206162 a productive society that can govern and provide services to its people as well as develop a gross national product
6206163 that does not come overnight thats an institutional change that will take some time
6206164 it is hard to describe the pride i had in the company and the overwhelming thanks of the soldiers
6206165 were very proud of our employees and their involvement in the support of the troops
6206166 the people and the management are outstanding and truly make working here enjoyable
6206167 i have been provided the opportunity to make a difference in the operation direction and success of the company
6206168 i think its pretty simple certainly its a tremendous sacrifice for the national guard and the disruption that they have in their life to go and fight for our freedom
6206169 theyre sacrificing so much we can sacrifice just a little to support them
6206170 life isnt about the amount of breaths you take its about the moments that take your breath away

6206174 many students and parents dont realize that federal loans are available regardless of income and they are a good deal especially in this volatile environment
6206175 different states have different aid programs that serve people in different ways

6206180 sometimes its not really your fault if someone is right behind you and you get snapped anyway
6206181 were going to move them to intersections that have higher rates of accidents
6206182 were not trying to be secretive or anything like that
6206183 were just trying to put them in the right locations
6206184 i think they could move them around a little bit and keep people guessing
6206185 i know where the ones are around my job but ill be on the lookout knowing there are some new ones
6206186 i used to often lie to myself about money id buy things on the credit card without checking balances or considering the consequences believing it wasnt that big of a deal or that i could easily afford it later sometimes id figure out my complete financial state know on some level that it was atrocious but tell myself that it wasnt bad and that i had things under control here are some of the tactics i used to overcome that tendency to deceive myself about my financial state without these tactics it would have been much more difficult to turn my financial life around

6206188 are you curious about how much you could be trading off for convenience and a bit of enjoyment the answer may astound you what ive done is a simple exercise that shows what would happen if we seriously account for the common money drains that besiege our budget when taken into totality our vices habits impulse purchases and daily fixes can amount to some huge numbers
6206189 snowflaking is a debt repayment process popularized by paid twice it involves not just designating a certain extra amount to be paid towards a loan every month a debt snowball but finding little ways to earn or save more money which can then be applied to the debt
6206190 apparently more and more americans are switching to scooters and light motorcycles these days in the bigger cities scooter riders can be easily spotted making their way through traffic both cheaper and faster ive been riding a scooter for half a year now and i must say i feel reborn i cant even fathom how i didnt make the switch to one of these vehicles sooner ive experienced something similar to a religious epiphany and im intent on promoting my recent new revelation to the masses
6206191 i like the idea of bartering the sharing of resources you have something i need and i have something you need so lets make a trade
6206192 i began doing online surveys about one year ago so far i have made over 125 and i am always joining new sites the average online survey pays anywhere between 3 to 5 dollars and takes about 20 minutes to complete this comes out to 9 to 15 an hour although doing online surveys is not going to allow you to quit your day job it can be a source of 20 to 30 a month

6206214 it is difficult to think of anything more depressing than a conference of female historians or more irrelevant to the future of the discipline of history none of these figures has ever appeared in any work on early modern history that i have ever read or is likely to figure on any reading list i see historians are and should be concerned with the past of humanity with men and women old and young alike being female is not a prerequisite for such studies and womens history like the histories of gender sexuality and the family is a transient ephemeral phenomenon

6206216 dolf zillmann asserts that extensive viewing of pornographic material produces many
6206217 it is like a raging storm destroying individuals and families utterly ruining what was once wholesome and beautiful suffice it to say that all who are involved become victims children are exploited and their lives are severely damaged the minds of youth become warped with false concepts continued exposure leads to addiction that is almost impossible to break men so very many find they cannot leave it alone their energies and their interests are consumed in their dead end pursuit of this raw and sleazy fare
6206218 pornography consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts from the intimacy of the partners in order to display them deliberately to third parties it offends against chastity because it perverts the conjugal act the intimate giving of spouses to each other it does grave injury to the dignity of its participants actors vendors the public since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others it immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy world it is a grave offense civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of pornographic materials
6206219 other feminists support unregulated access to pornography some describe themselves as
6206220 its a far different criticism to note that porn is sexist so are all commercial media thats like tasting several glasses of salt water and insisting only one of them is salty the only difference with porn is that it is people making love and we live in a world that cannot tolerate that image
6206221 a pastor and founder of xxxchurch com a web site promoting a religious view on pornography

6206223 thus the covenant that god made with the jewish people through moses remains eternally valid for them
6206224 to the jewish people whom god first chose to hear his word belong the sonship the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and of their race according to the flesh is the christ rom 9 4 5 cf ccc no 839
6206225 gal 5 4 to claim that anyone even just the jews can be saved through the law is to deny the holy catholic faith
6206226 catholics understand that all previous covenants that god made with the jewish people have been fulfilled in jesus christ through the new covenant established through his sacrificial death on the cross the prior version of the text might be understood to imply that one of the former covenants imparts salvation without the mediation of christ whom christians believe to be the universal savior of all people

6206294 in big seizures theres a very strong tendency to ship ivory out of a different country than where its poached its a bit of a red herring
6206295 the methods we developed are very important in that regard because it focuses where the poaching is ongoing
6206296 crime syndicates were targeting specific populations for intense exploitation hitting them hard and fast to satisfy the demands of a particular consignment
6206297 at the time of the analyses authorities thought the ivory came from tanzania and or the democratic republic of the congo our analyses refocused the investigation allowed authorities to point the finger at zambia and get them to do something

6206301 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
6206302 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans

6206318 i have just been told that arsenal are as well interested but my position is clear i want to start the season with everton
6206319 what rennes are currently offering me is far behind my demands both clubs have to find an agreement to help me leave
6206320 im aware that my directors have declared i wont leave but its just a means to make my price higher i understand their position and i would do the same
6206321 its politics regarding what ive heard i know general manager pierre dreossi is ready to let me leave from my part i dont want to play for rennes anymore
6206322 personnaly i dont worry because english clubs have the resources to sign me when they really want a player they are ready to spent whatever amount
6206323 im hopeful it will be done by next week that kind of opportunity only happens once everton offer me 1 5 million 1 2 million whereas i dont earn the half of it at rennes
6206324 even if i owe everything to this club rennes i have a family to feed regardless the challenge which is very interesting
6206325 microsoft is under tremendous market pressure from customers to enable interoperability with open source solutions their partnership with novell enables them to accomplish that within the framework of what microsoft views as appropriate intellectual property practices
6206326 if you look at the two fastest server operating systems youll see windows and linux microsoft figures there is going to be so much linux in use it had better get involved
6206327 theres a lot of linux out there much more than microsoft generally signals publicly and their customers are using it so its important that microsoft have a good interoperability story on that front linking up with a linux vendor is a good way to do that
6206328 novell is a relatively weak player in the linux market and therefore more malleable they also have a good partner channel and partners tend to be more opportunistic than vendors themselves so microsoft could realize some incidental sales through that channel
6206329 time has indicated that this partnership is good for both companies
6206330 novell has received a healthy boost in its linux revenue thanks in large part to the microsoft suse linux subscriptions both companies have leveraged the linux windows harmony story to gain significant new customers microsoft has managed to attach its name and potentially software to enterprise linux adoption
6206331 microsoft gains more indirectly as it enables them to pursue interoperability within their ip framework approach overall however microsoft gains more since this helps them shore up their formidable revenue base which dwarfs novells
6206332 customers win two ways for those that work with novell this is good since technical interoperability and direct partnership help them use novell better other open source companies customers also benefit since much of the work done in collaboration between novell and microsoft also applies to other open source products
6206333 customers are pretty much the reason for this so they do end up winning and not just novell microsoft customers but linux windows and multi os users too
6206334 whats key to this relationship is that to take advantage of it customers must be using or considering microsoft software
6206335 so microsoft learns about some of the challenges that customers face what workloads theyre using linux for and which theyre using microsoft for
6206336 while you can get numbers for the number of servers that go out with linux on them or red hats license revenues a great many customers simply download the product and in many cases install it multiple times

6206440 these students are a significant segment of the economy and an important part of the business
6206441 we need to be creative to stand out to this important audience to speak in a way that is relevant to them
6206442 the place i belong most in the world is israel
6206443 dallas was definitely the rock n roll capital of the world during ozzfest

6206446 she said they could see the fire and then it was not even a minute or so they heard something blow up
6206447 they were about 200 meters in the air and then they were landing but not crashing they were landing like little by little it was not like they fell down suddenly
6206448 an individual who is more personally comfortable with blacks than with whites on an individual level need not hold political ideologies which support the separation of blacks and whites on a community level
6206449 whites at princeton it often seems as if to them she will always be black first
6206450 if those whites at princeton really saw michelle as one who always would be black first it seems that she gave them that impression
6206451 by actually working with the black lower class or within their communities as a result of their ideologies a separationist may better understand the desperation of their situation and feel more hopeless about a resolution as opposed to an integrationist who is ignorant to their plight
6206452 further integration and or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society never becoming a full participant
6206453 when i first heard about the possibility of being allowed to protest i was very happy my issue could be resolved but it turned out all to be cheating i feel stuck in my heart
6206454 what the two old ladies did is nowhere near that
6206455 we are a communist society with the people the leaders and owners but basic citizens rights cannot even be realized today how sad it is the way things are is the opposite of the people oriented ideology of the country when it was founded
6206456 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones as well as the permit application process were no more than a show
6206457 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
6206458 the ioc is keen to see those questions answered by the relevant authorities
6206459 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6206460 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6206461 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threat from countries like iran or from north korea
6206462 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
6206463 who has good intentions towards us and towards the western world
6206464 he added spirit to the sport he danced for us in the introduction he danced for us at the end he put on a show to me i feel like him and athletics is like michael phelps and swimming he raised the bar for us in athletics

6206466 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6206467 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6206468 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6206469 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6206470 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6206471 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6206472 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6206473 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6206474 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6206475 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6206476 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6206477 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6206478 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
6206479 illegal file sharing is a very serious issue resulting in millions of pounds of losses to copyright owners
6206480 it really is a new world out there and its time the new reality was accepted for what it is
6206481 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6206482 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
6206483 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
6206484 this will be viewed as ebay continues to push paypal down everyones throat

6206486 its very important to stay involved with school not only with the teachers backgrounds but that parents get involved as well
6206487 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
6206488 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
6206489 once in a while you can get shown the light
6206490 its hard to guess where your life is going to be after something like this happens
6206491 but sometimes in an effort to save time you can do things that might slow you down
6206492 last year we saw a substantial increase in participation in the performance contest as we collected over 130 samples
6206493 while weather conditions have been inconsistent across the region we are hoping for a strong level of participation with many quality samples submitted for this years contest
6206494 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6206495 these firms are licenses broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments

6206501 gas electric retro mini would start off with fiats 900cc two cylinder engine hooked up to a battery pack and backed up by a start stop ignition system and a dual clutch transmission
6206502 we can anticipate that it will slow down however if supplies of good quality wheat materialize from other countries
6206503 all eyes are on the australian crop which will be harvested in december
6206504 it is off to a better start than the drought induced crop of the last two years
6206505 if australia has a large crop our sales in southern asia will be negatively affected
6206506 if the russian and black sea crop is big that affects sales to the middle east and caribbean where the black sea has a huge freight advantage
6206507 millers ive talked to have been milling 2008 wheat for the last several weeks everyone is happy
6206508 last year we had too low protein and the year before too high protein
6206509 its back to a normal wheat crop and millers are generally very pleased

6206511 underachievement the tallest blade of grass is the first to be cut by the lawnmower
6206512 we want all our personnel to know that health and security are the companys highest priorities
6206513 we are working with the algerian authorities to ensure the safety of our staff
6206514 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6206515 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6206516 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the
6206517 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6206518 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures
6206519 the uk united kingdom government fully supports the government of algeria in its fight against terrorism and condemns the attacks that have taken place in algeria in the last two days
6206520 i think theres going to be a groundswell of support for mccain
6206521 i think a lot of hillary supporters are going to be for mccain
6206522 youd have to say to yourself this is in fact world war iii
6206523 i might consider it i dont think its necessary but i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally could serve
6206524 i have just been told that arsenal are as well interested but my position is clear i want to start the season with everton
6206525 what rennes are currently offering me is far behind my demands both clubs have to find an agreement to help me leave
6206526 im aware that my directors have declared i wont leave but its just a means to make my price higher i understand their position and i would do the same
6206527 its politics regarding what ive heard i know general manager pierre dreossi is ready to let me leave from my part i dont want to play for rennes anymore
6206528 personnaly i dont worry because english clubs have the resources to sign me when they really want a player they are ready to spent whatever amount
6206529 im hopeful it will be done by next week that kind of opportunity only happens once everton offer me 1 5 million 1 2 million whereas i dont earn the half of it at rennes
6206530 even if i owe everything to this club rennes i have a family to feed regardless the challenge which is very interesting
6206531 the passing and the movement was very i mean we looked confident on the ball we looked like we were going to go on and score a few goals but the second half the game was just a lottery and the main thing was we didnt get any injuries
6206532 all week in training we had looked really good and i think everyone was looking forward to the game and after the first half an hour we all thought this was going to be really good so we could set a marker down for the group stages
6206533 no everyone just wanted the game played obviously the situation over there is very difficult so there was a doubt that it would go ahead but play the game is the most important thing and no matter where it is on the first half tonight we have shown we are ready for it
6206534 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

6206541 its true as state officials are saying that we have not seen what they call substantial job erosion but we are nevertheless seeing erosion in iowas job fortunes
6206542 these numbers today actually are a little better than what the state reported last month but its hard to get around the fact that theyre not good as the unemployment rate shows
6206543 it makes sense that as the state suggests business disruptions due to flooding are partly to blame for that increase so we dont know how lasting an impact we will see
6206544 it is notable that the last time the jobless rate was at 4 3 percent in august 2005 the rate was steadily coming down in iowa what weve been seeing in iowa in recent months is a steady rise in the unemployment rate which was 3 4 percent as recently as march
6206545 jobs actually declined in five of those 12 months so we are looking for some stability that may be difficult to find in these months following the floods
6206546 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6206547 i know a trail thats a dirt road thats mostly in the shade and itll be just a short walk
6206548 britney spears was the epitome of the california girl as she walked out of the surf in a white bikini
6206549 there arent enough black voters in missouri for barack obama to win it if he cant make things more competitive among white voters

6206559 when you look at all of the statin trials together what they show is there is no overall effect on cancer either increasing it or preventing it
6206560 although the absolute risk of esrd in women who have had preeclampsia is low preeclampsia is a marker for an increased risk of subsequent esrd
6206561 the association was stronger if the preeclamptic pregnancy resulted in a low birth weight or preterm infant
6206562 campbells light touch with the art beautiful yet often disturbing watercolors proves supple and fluid enough to convey scenes of whimsy and scenes of horror this might just be my favorite campbell yet i cant recommend it highly enough
6206563 you will love rediscovering the joy of a wild adventure comic that you cant stop reading you will love laughing at each inevitable change of fortune that makes leotards life so amazing so remarkable you will love once again letting eddie and dan best take hold of your consciousness and imagination and turn them inside out and upside down on the wildest ride youll find in comics this year
6206564 campbells artwork meanwhile is beyond beauty his color work here crosses styles and genres and employs some brilliant panel placement as well
6206565 eddie campbells books are becoming with each passing year more stunning
6206566 first second has made a name for itself by producing quality material but this book outdoes all of its previous endeavors
6206567 its a fine eddie campbell book in the style that no one else could replicate and a joy to read
6206568 restaurants have put items out there that will please a kids palette but with very little concern about nutritional content
6206569 well i notice that theres a very set regiment almost for what foods are available
6206570 generally its macaroni and cheese chicken fingers french fries a pizza slice spaghetti with sauce
6206571 what youll often see at restaurants are the favorite kid foods on the menu which may not be the healthiest choices
6206572 these restaurants have put items out there that will please a kids palette but with very little concern about nutritional content
6206573 when we do go out were very concerned about eating healthy
6206574 however we never think to gravitate outside the choices that are offered us
6206575 we are enslaved by speed and have all succumbed to the same insidious virus fast life which disrupts our habits pervades the privacy of our homes and forces us to eat fast foods our defense should begin at the table with slow food let us rediscover the flavors and savors of regional cooking and banish the degrading effects of fast food slow food guarantees a better future
6206576 its not really as stressful as school can be but its a challenge
6206577 my mom wakes me up at about ten and i have breakfast and they i start my reading for an hour and then i work on my math book like three or four pages a day
6206578 theres a lot of pressure on kids a lot of pressure on parents a lot of pressure on teachers that im not so sure is really so good for the kids or even necessarily for learning
6206579 its not just content that we need to drum into their heads and skills but we really need kids to have experiences theres a lot of incidental learning that goes on by having experiences other than homework
6206580 it helps him to review what he learned the previous year
6206581 and it makes the transition into the school year so much easier
6206582 you know sometimes it does get frustrating im like why do i always have to have people help me read over what ive written
6206583 bad grades and i remember being able to read but not understand or even remember what i read
6206584 i practice a lot with reading just reading different things and understanding
6206585 if you can get in there early enough you can help the other areas of the brain be retrained just as a natural course of learning to read and avoid the dyslexia completely
6206586 we know that there are changes that take place through different kinds of educational experiences
6206587 if you notice other youngsters are picking up sound and letter relationships much quicker than your child is
6206588 if there is something intense that can catch children at an early age with this disability i think that would be a great thing
6206589 i certainly think parents are misled many time by their youngsters
6206590 me and my friends we always sneak into r rated movies
6206591 i got a ticket to a different movie and then i went into the other one five minutes after the movie starts
6206592 there was a huge group of people and i just got in the middle and we all huddled through
6206593 you are really engaged in that movie you are sort of there
6206594 i dont know because we might think thats cool and stuff i dont know and start doing that kind of stuff
6206595 you basically say for a while now youre not going to be able to go to the movies independently or to the mall

6206697 when you look at all of the statin trials together what they show is there is no overall effect on cancer either increasing it or preventing it
6206698 we found a very interesting thing which is that in those studies the lower the ldl level the higher the risk of cancer it was a pretty strong effect
6206699 there was about a three fold increase in cancer going from the highest
6206700 statins on average lowered ldl by about 40 points so if statins did cause cancer that 40 point drop in ldl cholesterol should have produced eight more cancers
6206701 so in the statin group we would expect to see 20 cancers per thousand person years per thousand people per year instead what we found was 12 7 which was the exact same as in placebo patients

6206719 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6206720 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6206721 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6206722 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124

6206785 new jersey realtors use technology to simplify the home buying and selling process and make it more convenient for their clients

6206800 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6206801 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6206802 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6206803 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6206804 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6206805 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6206806 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed
6206807 watching television can slow the development of children under three even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them

6206815 with the tomato issue in the united states it went on for three or four months
6206816 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6206817 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6206818 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised

6206820 a year and a half ago there was huge sentiment that the chinese market was going to run until the olympics and then you needed to watch out it ran so fast that people started saying maybe weve gotten carried away with china
6206821 the selling started feeding on itself and now theres just this huge pullback

6206893 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6206894 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6206895 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat

6206906 acredit vamos que o pedido de adiamento poderia acontecer porque a portabilidade provoca mudan as no cen rio competitivo
6206907 o cumprimento do cronograma proposto pela anatel para 2008 e sua extens o para 2009 evidentemente que esse processo pela sua dimens o tem que entrar com os requisitos de padr o de qualidade de servi os definidos e aos quais os clientes est o acostumados caso contr rio as operadoras se tornar o alvo de reclama es sobre a qualidade de atendimento
6206908 o adiamento ou n o vai depender das justificativas apresentadas mas acredito que a anatel n o queira postergar o cronograma
6206909 its clear to me that if the plaintiff jacob was denied this relief he would suffer irreparable harm
6206910 his condition has already deteriorated significantly in the past year
6206911 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6206912 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6206913 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6206914 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6206915 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124
6206916 its clear that hes getting weaker as it goes on
6206917 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6206918 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e mails

6206921 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten i can only take you so seriously
6206922 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6206923 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6206924 avoiding foreclosure not only strengthens local neighborhoods where foreclosures are already driving down property values it makes good business sense this is a win win program all around
6206925 does collingwood need 50 to save his place 100 150
6206926 software is being seen as an inhibitors of process and business agility
6206927 the amount of fail on theforum com is reaching epic proportions
6206928 the army has consistently expressed a strong desire to enter into cleanup agreements for its remaining national priorities list sites at fort meade md and redstone arsenal ala
6206929 i love children and i think i have a lot i can give them
6206930 she was pushed and shoved into areas she should never have been and as a result of that she lost her job
6206931 its pretty challenging for someone to sit there and listen to someone reading something over and over again its pretty difficult
6206932 when web hosting was recently migrated to a new provider
6206933 we think the exposure is minimal but we certainly would not want to risk any of our student information being exposed to a security breach
6206934 were going in and were going to take care of this for these guys
6206935 you are absolutely on point about giving passengers a reason to smile as a number are around me this afternoon
6206936 the purser on this flight just came up to tell me about the happy reactions she has been getting from passengers i get the feeling she doesnt get that too often
6206937 we support most corporate vpns virtual private networks so that passengers can utilize the service in full compliance with their business security requirements in addition we are also working with isps that serve corporations ipass is one that weve announced so that passengers who are required to gain access through that enhanced security service can also use gogo
6206938 we considered a number of different options when we looked at this technology
6206939 the reason we went with aircell is that they offer the most robust option out there the equipment is lightweight equipment so from a fuel perspective were not concerned there
6206940 we think that the satellite based connectivity for us is a more robust experience for our customers
6206941 we believe its more consistent than air to ground we want to test it to see what the customer experience is before we install it on all our aircraft
6206942 the huge issue has been the cost of putting the systems into the planes
6206943 its made it very difficult to have a reasonable expectation to earn money off the system
6206944 i think an awful lot of people will find it attractive twelve dollars for a five hour flight is nothing if it provides sufficiently fast service for people who like to surf the web and arent driven crazy by slow speeds the business traveler doesnt surf the web they want to send and receive e mails its pretty straightforward and you dont need tremendous connectivity to do that
6206945 as we do with other content we provide onboard we trust that our customers will use good judgment and that will prevail
6206946 our flight attendants are pretty well trained to deal with and handle situations where someone is displaying inappropriate content

6206973 microsoft is under tremendous market pressure from customers to enable interoperability with open source solutions their partnership with novell enables them to accomplish that within the framework of what microsoft views as appropriate intellectual property practices
6206974 if you look at the two fastest server operating systems youll see windows and linux microsoft figures there is going to be so much linux in use it had better get involved
6206975 theres a lot of linux out there much more than microsoft generally signals publicly and their customers are using it so its important that microsoft have a good interoperability story on that front linking up with a linux vendor is a good way to do that
6206976 novell is a relatively weak player in the linux market and therefore more malleable they also have a good partner channel and partners tend to be more opportunistic than vendors themselves so microsoft could realize some incidental sales through that channel
6206977 time has indicated that this partnership is good for both companies
6206978 novell has received a healthy boost in its linux revenue thanks in large part to the microsoft suse linux subscriptions both companies have leveraged the linux windows harmony story to gain significant new customers microsoft has managed to attach its name and potentially software to enterprise linux adoption
6206979 microsoft gains more indirectly as it enables them to pursue interoperability within their ip framework approach overall however microsoft gains more since this helps them shore up their formidable revenue base which dwarfs novells
6206980 customers win two ways for those that work with novell this is good since technical interoperability and direct partnership help them use novell better other open source companies customers also benefit since much of the work done in collaboration between novell and microsoft also applies to other open source products
6206981 customers are pretty much the reason for this so they do end up winning and not just novell microsoft customers but linux windows and multi os users too
6206982 whats key to this relationship is that to take advantage of it customers must be using or considering microsoft software
6206983 so microsoft learns about some of the challenges that customers face what workloads theyre using linux for and which theyre using microsoft for
6206984 while you can get numbers for the number of servers that go out with linux on them or red hats license revenues a great many customers simply download the product and in many cases install it multiple times
6206985 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages

6206987 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6206988 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6206989 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6206990 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6206991 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar

6206997 all of our schools are working hard to provide georgias students with a great education
6206998 the results of this years ayp report demonstrate that the focus and hard work are paying off
6206999 these schools have had to raise expectations and improve faster than anyone else
6207000 we need to figure out why this number has gone up and from a state perspective what we can do to help
6207001 we will dig into these numbers and see what the data tells us
6207002 math is an area where we are putting a lot of focus these days and the ayp data shows us why
6207003 it is my hope that congress will embrace the idea of graduated consequences so that a school that missed ayp in just one area is not treated the same as a school that missed it across the board
6207004 our graduation rate is continuing to climb and is at its highest level
6207005 but we will not be satisfied until our graduation rate is 100 percent
6207006 as a state we are focusing on raising our graduation rate like never before and i know we will see this number go up dramatically in the coming years
6207007 is barack obama exaggerating when he compares his campaign to the great progressive moments in us history
6207008 obama really said something like that his campaign is a movement comparable to say the civil rights movement or to second wave feminism or to the labor movement after the industrial revolution if so i had missed it
6207009 any statement from the candidate himself that compared obama 08 to the great movements for freedom and justice in our history would have been quite the controversy what with the mccain camp already mocking his messiah complex and calling him
6207010 do i personally think that obama sees his candidacy as on par with the civil rights movement or revolutionary war soldiers no
6207011 nothing we write is in service of the obama campaign and its goals

6207039 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

6207096 its important now to find compounds that can be used in imaging because the earlier clinicians can detect the disease the better the chances are that a drug will halt disease progression while patients still have strong cognitive abilities
6207097 when we added these compounds to the reaction their interaction with the tau protein inhibited filaments from forming which could be valuable for therapeutics because it would prevent the formation of tau tangles some people think if we clear away the pathology seen in diseased brains that might alleviate symptoms of alzheimers disease

6207099 broadcom is a major supplier of soc solutions for the converter box market and we are very excited to support the nations transition from analog to digital broadcasting by enabling cable stb manufacturers with a leading dta chip

6207101 e mmc nand devices are an effective solution for the needs of many consumer applications like cameras cell phones pdas and automotive infotainment systems as an example a 32gb e mmc can hold 16 000 high resolution digital photos 8 000 songs or up to 20 hours of high definition video
6207102 ultimately because micron manufactures nand we are able to capitalize on our outstanding process technology well established ip and a deep commitment to forwarding nand memory to bring products like this to market in fact we also have the capability to pair e mmc devices with low power dram in multi chip packages mcps ultimately our recent move to the 34nm process was a major accomplishment and these product lines directly benefit from that innovation

6207171 werent interfering with tv channels which is sort of our point
6207172 these mics were broadcasting at much higher volumes than a broadband device would with no interference
6207173 although other devices have apparently been operating in their bands for years broadcasters have not objected to the very scenario they claim would justify prohibiting personal portable white space operations
6207174 broadcasters have for years acquiesced to these types of co channel operations
6207175 in our view theres a huge difference between wireless microphones and the unlicensed white space devices proposed by google and microsoft
6207176 by contrast the proposed white space devices would be mass produced and potentially operated by millions of untrained consumers in unlimited locations
6207177 hence under this scenario we believe the interference implications and threat to clear television pictures would increase exponentially
6207178 tv is a great thing the way it is we dont want to replace tv we want to augment and add value to the tv experience

6207188 if the russia georgia war proves nothing else it is the insanity of giving erratic hotheads in volatile nations the power to drag the united states into war had george w bush prevailed and were georgia in nato u s marines could be fighting russian troops over whose flag should fly over a province of 70 000 south ossetians who prefer russians to georgians

6207218 no everyone just wanted the game played obviously the situation over there is very difficult so there was a doubt that it would go ahead but play the game is the most important thing and no matter where it is on the first half tonight we have shown we are ready for it

6207321 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
6207322 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
6207323 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
6207324 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area
6207325 in a decade we should know a lot more about this population than we do now
6207326 is to understand the origin of comets which are among the most spectacular celestial events but the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed
6207327 in order to really get at the issue is there life out there we have to know the best place to look
6207328 and in the case of europa the best place to look is where cracks on its icy surface are active today
6207329 this research feeds that need that i have as a geologist and as a person to be the explorer to be the adventurer to see things that no one else has seen before and figure out things that no one else has figured out before
6207330 and out in the solar system is a great place to do that because there are some things like the plumes on enceladus that we really are seeing for the very first time
6207331 europa has the potential for something very similar to hydrothermal systems we have here in our oceans
6207332 very ancient organisms that thrive on oxidized metals potentially could be centered on one of these oases formed by heat and metals seeping from cracks in the ocean floor
6207333 we dont walk around on earth with our eyes closed we want to know whats going on why things happen
6207334 its like galileo looking through his telescope all those centuries ago and going gosh whats out there its that same spirit of exploration and i just get a real kick out of that
6207335 its just the glue that holds everything in society together is music so im happy to be a part of that
6207336 we ran a story captioned children pick scrap metal children dodge school to pick scrap metal you know in which we thought we were drawing attention to an issue to show some concern
6207337 it was innocent we were not making any judgment nor assumption but unfortunately police thought it was kind of embarrassing to the state so that was actually what caused the trouble
6207338 you can probably say some of them are in a state of fear because the average journalist in the gambia probably earns less than 100 a month and for them to realize that if i commit a so called offense i will be fined up to 10 000 it kinds of puts some fear into people and obviously will effect the output of their work
6207339 we have been condemning what is going on in the gambia with journalists for years now and fatou jaw mannehs case is just one more case of harassment and personal revenge of president yahya jammeh based on the police and the justice system of the gambia which is completely in his hands
6207340 every year we count dozens of arrests and also dozens of gambian journalists fleeing the country and living in exile
6207341 independent newspapers were attacked by unidentified men and the journalists reported seeing a vehicle with government license plates so we are particularly disturbed and alarmed by these reports which would suggest that these were government sponsored attacks raids against newsrooms
6207342 and essentially the newspapers targeted are known for their critical coverage of the government
6207343 if the government itself is not interested in the protection of journalists
6207344 if top officials are out threatening journalists then it is left for journalists to really guarantee their own protection and thats exactly what the editors of these newspapers and others have told us that they will be hiring security to guarantee their own protection
6207345 absolutely by all accounts it seems that the gloves are coming off
6207346 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6207347 mccain has done what he needs to do with the religious right so he has some latitude now to make a clear appeal to the center and this is part of that
6207348 the parents like the farmers market because its a great environment so its kind of our way of doing something for the public and sort of thanking them for patronizing the farmers market and poplar grove
6207349 as weve seen throughout the primary season technology is playing an increasingly critical role in the electoral process
6207350 microsoft will help ensure that both parties delegates are able to take full advantage of the benefits that todays technologies offer
6207351 this time around we are supplying both parties with some very innovative technology such as interactive displays portable music players and high definition video streaming
6207352 microsofts leadership in software development makes them an ideal partner for the dncc
6207353 microsofts pioneering technology will play an integral role in powering the business of the convention and helping to involve more americans in the convention experience than ever before

6207369 worked with so many huge bands yet hes super down to earth we were recommended to him by our friends in every avenue so if it wasnt for them or naclerio we wouldnt be here signing our contract today
6207370 we go through so many demos and myspace pages each week its amazing we can get anything else done
6207371 luckily i had their cd in my hands that day and i immediately phoned the band directly it took us about a month to work out a deal but i pretty much wanted to sign them the first day i heard them
6207372 you only need to listen to one song once from f15 and you get hooked and start singing the thing all day that is what grabbed me when i was driving home after one listen through and i was singing it i knew we wanted the band
6207373 we have bumper stickers signs and things like that to take home and we want to meet you all
6207374 i think its important to open an office in wilmington all the college kids are swaying more to the democratic side for barack obama because hes a minority in the aspect of everything i think its good to show that republicans can stand and be just as strong as everyone else and that john mccain should be there for next presidency

6207409 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6207410 we knew from x ray data that this black hole was actively swallowing up or accreting material if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds thus the high winds were our smoking gun showing that this black hole is small

6207429 although comcasts terms of use statement may have specified that its broadband internet access service was subject to speed and upstream and downstream rate limitations such vague terms are of no practical utility to the average customer

6207471 a seguito di queste continue insinuazioni mi madre mi ha portato in un centro medico dove sono stato sottoposto al drug test ho fatto il test per dimostrare che non facevo uso di droghe con il risultato davanti mio padre ha continuato a dire che io mi drogo e che il test era stato falsificato questo purtroppo un punto fermo sul quale lui crede di potersi appoggiare per vincere a modo suo questa guerra

6207485 were going against something that we promised were going against our oath were contradicting the constitution in a way
6207486 weve been through this weve been through the things that theyve been through are going through things that theyre facing whether it be not knowing the rights available to them the fact that they can speak their opinion or having trouble getting the proper mental health care weve been through that too and were here for them

6207526 this time the company got a little help from the weak dollar
6207527 the company had strong tailwinds in europe and the asia pacific region
6207528 impressive in light of concerns that a stronger u s dollar would be negative for its international business
6207529 the company remains well positioned for the long term given its leadership in pc notebooks and emerging markets

6207539 the idea of selling the bronze for scrap prices is one where the risk far outweighs the rewards
6207540 anyone involved in such a chain of events risks losing everything and imprisonment for very little return the laws tracking and regulations on this industry are becoming more and more sophisticated
6207541 many people pass it and really believe there is a police officer giving a ticket
6207542 we certainly hope that the wonderful sculpture is returned it means so much to us
6207543 the four point approach works because it gives every person a chance to be listened to giving each a platform to do what they think is vital and important for the downtown
6207544 for the longest time we all waited for a white knight to ride into town and fix the problem but the main street people made us realize that the only way to get it done right was to do it ourselves
6207545 oh yes yes im a huge fan of the moomins have you read the moomins

6207549 we feel that a customer service and support market is a fantastic one and we feel this market is really poised to flip to software as a service that is why we are saying we want to have all of the pieces in place for an absolutely killer offering
6207550 when we look at an acquisition we look at the track record of customer success we look at the technology and we also look at the team
6207551 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6207552 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6207553 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6207554 these people need a new ouija board all these big smart guys forecast there would be an increase of 800 000 barrels its an increase of crude oil of 9 4 million barrels
6207555 my guess is that there is still some suspicion that with at least a partial relationship with u s financials canadian banks are going to have to show some kind of stress some kind of writedown on some of their assets which they havent done so far
6207556 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6207557 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6207558 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6207559 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6207560 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6207561 are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the price of oil is on a weekly basis
6207562 these people need a new ouija board all these big smart guys forecast there would be an increase of 800 000 barrels its an increase of crude oil of 9 4 million barrels

6207573 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
6207574 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
6207575 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
6207576 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
6207577 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6207578 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6207579 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6207580 the steep price of new debt raises the level of difficulty for both institutions in remaining solvent as higher interest rate costs cuts steeply into their operating margins thereby threatening both agencies with even deeper losses in coming quarters
6207581 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates weve also been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6207582 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6207583 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6207584 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6207585 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6207586 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6207587 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6207588 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6207589 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6207590 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6207591 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6207592 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6207593 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6207594 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6207595 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6207596 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6207597 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6207598 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6207599 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6207600 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6207601 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6207602 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6207603 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6207604 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6207605 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6207606 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6207607 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6207608 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6207609 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6207610 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6207611 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6207612 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6207613 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6207614 who are open to doing something on the production side
6207615 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6207616 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6207617 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6207618 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6207619 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6207620 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6207621 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6207622 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6207623 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6207624 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6207625 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6207626 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6207627 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6207628 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6207629 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6207630 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6207631 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6207632 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6207633 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6207634 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6207635 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6207636 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6207637 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6207638 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6207639 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6207640 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6207641 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6207642 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6207643 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6207644 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6207645 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6207646 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6207647 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6207648 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6207649 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6207650 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6207651 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6207652 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6207653 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6207654 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6207655 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

6207664 this is the primary role i want to be on this progression journey invest in me and ill help you along it
6207665 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6207666 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6207667 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6207668 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6207669 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6207670 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6207671 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6207672 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6207673 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6207674 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6207679 bill c 484 endangers abortion rights and womens rights by establishing fetal personhood
6207680 essentially establishes the fetus as a new legal entity a person with the right not to be killed or injured this can endanger abortion rights since anti abortion legislators and lobbyists could cite his bill as authority to introduce restrictions on abortion
6207681 the most deeply worrying aspect of the article is that the public and members of parliament who have an especially important role to play in this debate might not realize the serious errors of law
6207682 bill c 484 does not make the fetus a person
6207683 it does recognize the existence of the fetus as a number of presently existing laws already do including the criminal code and tort law importantly bill c 484 would in fact not affect the law on abortion nor would it criminalize pregnant women for any harm they may cause to their own unborn children
6207684 only about abortion for those abortion rights advocates who are so extreme in their views that they cannot get past their strident ideology to feel any compassion for a woman who is a tragic victim of crime
6207685 robbing women of the added protection in criminal law of bringing their children safely into the world

6207691 this compromise budget puts us on the road to fiscal sanity

6207730 although the absolute risk of esrd in women who have had preeclampsia is low preeclampsia is a marker for an increased risk of subsequent esrd
6207731 the association was stronger if the preeclamptic pregnancy resulted in a low birth weight or preterm infant
6207732 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks

6207758 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and and you should try to reduce that risk
6207759 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant
6207760 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent and diabetes
6207761 indeed the likelihood that did not develop even among women with three previous episodes of preeclampsia was greater than 99 percent
6207762 its critical that doctors and patients understand that there is now a linkage between preeclampsia and esrd for women whove had preeclampsia this is a reason to increase your sensitivity to healthy living and not add to your risk keep your weight down avoid smoking and avoid drinking too much also check for diabetes and blood pressure at least once a year

6207766 its not too much to say that as rockingham county goes so will the election go
6207767 rockingham historically has had a large republican tilt but the republican tilt has gotten smaller and smaller over the past 20 years
6207768 the smaller towns places like auburn and chester tend to be republican towns
6207769 but theyre small and portsmouth as it has become so yuppified over the last couple of decades has become a democratic stronghold and balances out some of the other communities politically
6207770 it has been going democratic but has a lot of republican elected officials at the county level and also theres a split at the legislative level so its a big one for us
6207771 people here are very active and involved in the community so it makes sense

6207775 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of web 2 0
6207776 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6207777 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6207778 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6207779 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6207780 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6207781 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6207782 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6207783 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet
6207784 there never has been any 3d graphics in this space before and we think it opens up some dramatic new opportunities
6207785 i was showing madison the firework show on my phone

6207787 the ones at west point didnt seem to hurt madisons ears
6207788 oh but these were really loud i think they would hurt her ears
6207789 they really had a lot of fireworks at the show
6207790 yeah i really think that they probably spent all the money they made from the game on the fireworks

6207803 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability

6207811 i have made a detailed examination of emmas chest yes chaps eat your hearts out er sorry er and i can conclude that the lumps on emmas chest are in fact modified sudoriferous sweat glands or as they are more commonly reffered to breasts you know bumpers boomers tits boulders
6207812 i can confirm that they are a pleasantly rounded specimen pair with no apparent defects and should last emma for at least the next 70 or more years should she fall pregnant i believe they may produce human milk suitable for any son or daughter she may give birth to
6207813 i now ask the members of the press not to be alarmed by these lumps or to spread any gossip or rumour which may disturb young girls or increase the sales of ok magazine
6207814 of course should similar lumps appear on any boys not resident in thailand please feel free to contact the news of the world and arrange for the acceptance of a large cheque

6207833 its what fuels us i know not all of this team was there but everybody else watched it on tv weve already watched film on that game and i think were a much better team now sometimes losses turn out to be the biggest wins because you can learn more and they can motivate you
6207834 you can see that people are all about winning its never been about the stat sheet or whos got what
6207835 and i told them in our very first meeting that after winning three gold medals i cant remember who led what in any statistics

6207853 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6207854 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6207855 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6208036 we have a destroyed trailer with a lot of burnt contents weve deemed from pictures that the contents arent worth taking to california well stop in wyoming and drop off four of our employees to sift through the contents and well pick up the two truck drivers and take them to sonoma with us
6208037 basically theyll be parts cars for the weekend and well take the two cars that are already there and make them into race cars

6208119 however this does not directly link him with the case in any way after all having a suspicious background or even working for a bogus company is not enough to book anyone for involvement in terror activities

6208143 nationals list incidentally still looks light on women only four rank in the top 24 from which a cabinet would be likely to be drawn

6208152 the error could not have come from confusing the advanced cruise missile with a conventional weapons since no conventional form exists so the munitions airmen should have been easily able to spot the mistake other routine procedures were violated which suggests a rather obvious explanation for the error the military munitions personnel were acting under direct orders though not through the regular chain of military command
6208153 where the warheads are separated from the rest of the weapon and shipped to the energy departments pantex dismantlement facility near amarillo texas

6208184 this action symbolises the determination and steadfast commitment of the tibetan people and our supporters from around the world to achieve freedom and justice for six million tibetans living under the brutal rule of the chinese government
6208185 the chinese government is petrified of these peaceful acts of defiance simply because they represent the true feelings of tibetans inside tibet
6208186 our protests are a reminder to the world of the tragic reality of the chinese governments illegitimate occupation of tibet and the urgent need for the chinese leadership to seek a resolution with the tibetan people

6208199 the injury update is fine but we can only milk that for five minutes max
6208200 we can easily drop 15 every time he demands a trade or bickers with the nfl league office all we can really do right now is pray for a shooting or something preferably with critical injuries that last parts off the record by the way
6208201 unlikely frankly ive seen chads handwriting and its pretty poor
6208202 plus that would give chad time to think about what hes about to say and he might backtrack on some of his more idiotic comments which could really prove fatal to us
6208203 i was concerned chad might have been giving his mouth too much of a
6208204 i think this could be a blessing in disguise just to let chad know his limits when youve been making headlines with every comment for that long you can push yourself beyond what is necessary this could be a good time for chad to step back and reevaluate his goals
6208205 ive been there i know what its like to have your most valuable asset taken out from under you i remember when i got my wisdom teeth removed it was really hard to talk for like two or three days i cant even imagine going four weeks now who wants to hear about how i made pacman my bitch today
6208206 its very realistic that well be paying something related to what we actually do online rather than a flat monthly fee
6208207 if they just send a little e mail they may actually benefit if they watch video online or they use peer to peer applications they may end up paying more
6208208 im online all of the time my instant messenger is always up so i feel like id have really high fees with all of that
6208209 after hearing that i think that is kind of reasonable
6208210 thats a very good idea because i know there are times when im on the internet and it takes an hour not an hour obviously but it takes a long time for a page to load

6208213 there will be no consumer input on how that money gets spent

6208215 our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
6208216 we found that there is indeed an association that the lower the ldl cholesterol the higher the risk of cancer
6208217 despite the ldl lowering capacity of statins however the data are quite reassuring that statins dont increase the risk of cancer
6208218 this raised the obvious question and concern that interventions that lower ldl cholesterol might offset the lowered risk of heart disease by increasing the risk of cancer
6208219 there is a bit of a conundrum because previous studies have looked at whether the use of statins increased the risk of cancer and the answer to that was no so we had a bit of quandary how could it be that low ldl is associated with a higher risk of cancer but statins which lower ldl cholesterol dont seem to cause cancer
6208220 we dont know why its true and we can only speculate about the reason
6208221 people with low levels of ldl also have a low risk of atherosclerosis but its not known if they have low levels of inflammatory reactions thats important because the immune system is part of the surveillance system for ridding the body of cancer your own immune system is trying to find cells that are mutating into cancer cells and get rid of them
6208222 the randomly recruited cohorts in the large statin trials undoubtedly included some subjects who had low ldl levels at the time they entered the study because they already had cancer
6208223 low ldl is the result not the cause of cancer

6208238 frau ist so bl d auf so ein angebot einzugehen
6208239 aber auch die m nner spielen in ihrem konzept korrigieren sie mich eine sehr untergeordnete rolle bei der erziehung wieso sollte das so sein wieso sollten sie sich allein aufreiben m ssen auf dem arbeitsmarkt und mit ihren kindern wenn berhaupt nicht mehr als ein paar worte wechseln k nnen w re das berhaupt im sinne der kinder oder w rden sie nicht um etwas wertvolles beraubt

6208275 soon the solitary protest at kacchi chhawani chowk in paralaysed jammu turns into a mass frenzy as hundreds join him to express solidarity for a cause that has gone far beyond the amarnath land row
6208276 we raised the tricolour and were greeted with bullets they separatists in kashmir hoisted pakistans flag and brought the government to its knees it will not be allowed to continue any more
6208277 we are leaders in ourselves nobody is leading us we are ready to face problems today to ensure a better future for the generations
6208278 kashmir wants freedom we love our country they got everything we were left empty handed
6208279 you dont get promotions on time if you are not from the valley jammu has more population and area but kashmir gets better representation in all government bodies and organisations jammu contributes the most to the states exchequer but kashmir reaps the benefits electricity dues are more in kashmir but jammu faces power cuts
6208280 we have to restore the pride of baba amarnath and that of jammu we are not going to be defeated at the hands of the anti nationals we will be on the roads until the target is achieved
6208281 how can you expect us to fire at them or even wield a lathi when they come with a tricolour in their hands and shout slogans in favour of us
6208282 more than 1 000 government employees of the valley have been accommodated in jammu
6208283 instead of giving them protection the government is providing them buses to leave it has expressed its inability to provide them security
6208284 in july 2007 only 2 000 trucks had taken goods from kashmir whereas in july 2008 the number of trucks was 2 300
6208285 more than 90 truck drivers and cleaners from jammu who had gone to the valley with essential supplies were attacked by separatists
6208286 the attackers have stated that power from the plant should not go out of the valley to the rest of the country
6208287 when she says that kashmir needs azadi from india and india needs azadi from kashmir our response is that india can live without arundhati but not without kashmir
6208288 negotiated settlement on the shri amarnath shrine board land issue
6208289 its omissions and commissions without any clear cut policy direction have led to this current situation and impasse
6208290 more the delay more it will harm the integrity of the country the government must address the nationalist aspirations and not buckle under the pressure of separatists
6208291 the pakistan national assembly resolution demanding plebiscite is totally unacceptable and condemnable when india has not reacted to president musharrafs resignation as it is an internal matter pakistan is expected to reciprocate similarly
6208292 when she says that kashmir needs azadi from india and india needs azadi from kashmir our response is that india can live without arundhati but not without kashmir

6208305 i think he has been quite an effective governor in many areas but at this point in time it is hard to see how he would bring strength to the ticket in the national security area which i think the american public will be looking for in this election
6208306 but it may well be that his achievements as governor which i think are considerable and the high regard in the state for him could offset that
6208307 you would have to concede that having a governor from virginia running on the ticket would be of some help to obama in virginia
6208308 these are traditional voters who tend to favor moderate republican candidates and not ultraconservative republican candidates and i think senator mccain is the type of republican who does very very well out there
6208309 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6208310 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6208311 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years

6208318 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together

6208322 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6208323 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
6208324 help from in the form of usable bug reports and responsible time lines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible our vulnerability bulletins will credit responsible reporters of any flaws
6208325 a beta test by any other name is still a beta test
6208326 its a wise practice for google emphasizing that android is going to be solid and stable is important to google particularly because we are seeing a version one release and we know that version one releases come with their own set of challenges
6208327 obviously how apple tests its products and the forum in which it tests its products is somewhat different than what google is doing here
6208328 when im president there will be a whole lot more like this not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
6208329 we need to drill offshore we need to do it now
6208330 the reality is that senator mccain can visit oil rigs and do photo ops all he wants but it is pretty clear from the policies hes advocating that hes literally over the barrel when it comes to the oil industry
6208331 these sites provide a record for the future about the workings of the government in this day and time
6208332 most government information today is published on the web and not published in paper
6208333 in the past 10 years there has been a radical change in the way that information is published by the government to its constituents
6208334 the majority of information is actually made available through these web sites but they are changing very rapidly as new information is introduced and especially as administration changes occur
6208335 when bush took over the second that he was sworn in the white house web site went from being this massive collection of important links to a picture of bush and his biography and a picture of vice president cheney and his biography
6208336 we dont want to see that happen again its just very important for historys sake that this material is archived the way that the printed material has always been archived

6208344 we are pleased to report that our revenue in the second quarter was within our stated guidance gross margin in the second quarter of 2008 declined as compared to the first quarter of 2008 primarily due to lower capacity utilization in memory final testing and price erosion of dram business flash revenues declined 7 quarter over quarter and contributed to around 29 of our total revenue in q2 down from 32 in the previous quarter in a more positive light among our flash sector mask rom revenues were up 10 quarter over quarter and contributed to 7 of flash revenue mixed signal revenues were also up 11 quarter over quarter and contributed to 8 of our total revenue revenues from our lcd driver ic increased 3 in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2008 reflecting a brief recovery in demand from our customers dram revenues remained relatively flat up 1 in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous quarter
6208345 our capex in the second quarter was us 15 2 million which was down from us 26 2 million in the first quarter of 2008 in july we received the final approval from shanghai government to cut down our capital investment obligation before end of this year to us 130 million we have completed our obligation by investing the remaining us 7 5 million of investment commitment in early august combining our cash position and undrawn credit lines provided by banks we have more than sufficient financial resources to face the debt due in 2008 there is no urgent need for company to raise additional fund in any form from the market
6208346 the overall dram market visibility in following quarters remains limited we do not anticipate the recovery of our dram business due to weaker than expected pc demand we remain cautious on the lcd market due to weak seasonal demand however we still notice better demands from our customers in q4 as compared to q3 in addition gold bumping business will maintain its growth momentum in the second half due to new customer programs mask rom and mixed signal revenues should continue to grow with the increase in demands from customers considering the overall market situation among our product segments we currently expect that q3 revenue to be in the range of approximately us 149 million to us 159 million which is down 6 to flat as compared to q2 and gross margin to be in the range of 2 5 to 5 5 in the current down cycle we are strongly confident in our ability to maintain healthy operations and we plan to continue our disciplined capital expenditures and to strictly focus on cost savings and customer expansion

6208349 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6208350 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6208351 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6208352 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6208353 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6208354 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6208355 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6208356 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6208357 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6208358 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6208359 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6208360 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president

6208369 they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate
6208370 year after year one thing has become clear when women vote women and democrats win
6208371 thats why this study is so important to understanding the messages and issues that will motivate this critical segment of the electorate
6208372 they werent marked on their information about the olympic games but on whether they used persuasive language effectively to make their argument
6208373 when it comes to lost people are obsessed with peeling away the layers and trying to get one step ahead while there are mysteries inside our show and there will certainly be ongoing elements i dont know if it replicates the intrigue lost has
6208374 because its science based taken to the level of science fiction there will never be the werewolf episode
6208375 we will never have a jigsaw man unless there is a scientific explanation which would be a bit of a stretch
6208376 my script has my name printed on it they have to change the letters inside the script to serialize them so they know who leaked it in case it gets out i also had to sign a non disclosure agreement for when i get my script every week

6208397 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6208398 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded remarkable remarkable
6208399 no rational observer can go to iraq and see what we are doing for the last years and say the surge hasnt succeeded

6208404 we need them out here they need to be out here they need to be out here hopefully they will be stronger and ready to come right back tomorrow
6208405 everybody needs to work you need to work with the quarterback you need to be on the field you need to establish some consistency some reliability and that is what we need
6208406 hopefully we can get all of the receivers back and get them healthy just so we can get into the flow of things
6208407 it was a good break but i think mentally it was a little difficult just to deal with not being out there doing stuff i ordinarily do seeing the guys out there working and not being able to help with the reps and stuff that was the difficult part other than that in terms of me being ready for the season i dont think its going to be difficult for me to pick it up
6208408 i dont want to be out for any reason so its kind of tough
6208409 in my mind yeah but coach coughlin wants me to be out there every day
6208410 this is the preseason so im not really stressing right now i want to get the quality reps in working with the blitzes and hot routes and stuff with eli thats the most unfortunate thing just not getting get those quality practice reps
6208411 he is good in the slot running routes running hook routes and doing some good things
6208412 it was my groin first and then i kept practicing and my hamstring started getting really tight up high so it was probably compensating for my groin injury
6208413 its been tough because i felt like ive been doing well and then the groin then the hamstring so it kind of stinks but you fight through it
6208414 i feel like i didnt do anything since i got injured a couple of days into camp
6208415 when this first happened i had to get my rehab in and get out there and get mental reps i feel way better though its just going through an injury im just trying to get back out there its been awhile since ive been out there but i have to get in the swing of things
6208416 i have to take advantage of having those guys around so i can learn from them
6208417 they have been in the nfl for a long time and its good to have two receivers like that to be there critiquing you and knowing that they have been in the same spot as i have
6208418 he did run a little bit faster in the individual stuff
6208419 it just worked out that way there werent a whole lot of passes thrown to be honest with you the numbers might reflect it 15 out of 30 is not the most accurate percentage in the world and we need to get it spread around and get the ball in their hands
6208420 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site here in poland that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6208421 the presence of the patriot battery which will defend our territory and the u s installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement
6208422 for poland and the united states this is just one more example of the deepening of our relations over the last 20 years

6208440 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6208441 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6208442 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6208443 that is the essential role that the democratic change commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations

6208466 there is a concern with all technology keep in mind this is about vision of sight and we really rely on the community and those neighbors need to be aware of that and be our eyes and ears its not just about the cameras
6208467 the median waiting time for elective eye surgery in a public hospital was 69 days which was the longest of any specialty
6208468 we werent able to see why but it might be that there is a shortage of eye surgeons or that other types of surgery are seen to be more urgent
6208469 you should never give up on those who have obsessive compulsive disorder and autism
6208470 it takes time a lot of patience and it takes a while to cope with it dont go down without a fight stay strong
6208471 we realized that we had so many referrals for kids with autism that we wanted to have something amazing to offer
6208472 we use the association for behavior analysis aba methods but we wanted to be out of the box and creative with our program because every child learns differently

6208486 we are currently reviewing their technical and economic terms but not their political component
6208487 did someone within the u s suggest that iraq reach out to russia as a show of good will or did russia want to show that they are indispensable in the middle east that they are a player
6208488 russia wants to go back into areas where it has lost influence
6208489 they might be able to say we are a responsible player that would certainly counter their image over the past two weeks as a force that can do a lot of damage
6208490 the only danger is if there are deals to sell of some of that infrastructure to russia power plants and such
6208491 that would come with greater political influence which would not fit in with our policies in the middle east
6208492 new old world we shouldnt tell iraq anything other than hopefully we can accumulate some of the oil at a discount for our recent infrastructure support

6208533 if you arent doing anything wrong what do you have to hide
6208534 if im not doing anything wrong then you have no cause to watch me
6208535 because the government gets to define whats wrong and they keep changing the definition
6208536 if one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man i would find something in them to have him hanged
6208537 certainly from the looks of this team i expect a lot more than that a fourth place finish its too early for me to get really optimistic but i really like this group they are starting to come together with their own personality and they work extremely hard its all business and i think the senior class is on a mission they had those championships they were used to and we didnt pull that off last year and i know they want to leave here with that they put a lot of work into offseason conditioning and that strength and conditioning stuff is very very demanding i really like the job our strength and conditioning coach brad potts has done and the kids will tell you they feel more athletic leaner stronger and i think its helped our entire athletic department
6208538 everybody talks about the schedule i know marist has a football game prior to playing us so theyll have an advantage by having a game under their belt they have a new stadium and theyve got nothing to lose im not concerned with what we did with them last year or in previous years were concerned about our operation about how we go out and play as a team for four quarters
6208539 well have two weeks and a few days of preseason followed by two weeks and a few days of classes before our first game which is different than in the past but i think thats a positive thing theyll be able to adjust to classes
6208540 i dont like putting undue pressure on any part of our team but certainly our defense is the core of our success offensively i think we have a lot of weapons we have a quarterback who has some experience and now we have to get somebody ready behind him marc quilling saw a lot of time last night at the scrimmage the success of the season is really about our seniors and i think this is a really special group i think we have great leadership by our senior group and our captains joe russo they are two hard working guys who will make sacrifices off the field and will demand that of our players which will be important
6208541 i think what theyve the offense done is gone through the playbook and cleaned it up i think we streamlined it and really did a good job with cleaning some things up we just want to have a balanced offense and be able to adjust to any situation you need to find out who the backup quarterback is going to be and it doesnt help you to hand the ball off all the time i believe in running in the ball and stopping the run but i also believe in moving the ball and that takes a variety of different things and i think we have a lot of great weapons its not all about smashmouth football
6208542 i think we do have a handle on it we had refs in here for five straight days because we want to make sure were adjusted to it the biggest thing i think will be the reduction in the number of plays and the time of the game it will be interesting to see one of the problems youll have is in the long play and getting everyone down there i think more teams will go no huddle because there will be less time for adjustments

6208614 my portrait hung in the university up until the revolution by then the truth of their romance had been reduced to a simple fairy tale and while cinderella and her prince did live happily ever after the point gentlemen is that they lived
6208615 when people think youre dying they listen instead of waiting for their turn to speak
6208616 humans act so strange everything you create is used to destroy
6208617 you know you would be a much more contented pleasant person if you would find ways to occupy your time

6208620 death cannot stop true love all it can do is delay it for a while
6208621 you cant hurt me westley and i are joined by the bonds of love and you cannot track that not with a thousand bloodhounds and you cannot break it not with a thousand swords
6208622 i had to be next to you i was being drawn to you
6208623 i am nothing special just a common man with common thoughts and ive led a common life there are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten but in one respect i have succeeded as gloriously as anyone whos ever lived ive loved another with all my heart and soul and to me this has always been enough
6208624 my dearest allie i couldnt sleep last night because i know that its over between us im not bitter any more because i know that what we had was real and if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives ill smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees learning from each other and growing in love the best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds and thats what youve given me thats what i hope to give to you forever i love you ill be seeing you

6208629 what if your home what if your family what if your dope was on fire
6208630 dear mr vernon we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong but we think youre crazy to make an essay telling you who we think we are you see us as you want to see us in the simplest terms in the most convenient definitions but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain
6208631 does that answer your question sincerely yours the breakfast club
6208632 dear annette i dont know what i could possibly say that would rectify the harm ive caused you the truth of the matter is that being with you was the only time i have ever been happy my whole life has been a joke i prided myself on taking joy in others misery well it finally backfired i succeed in hurting the first person i ever loved enclosed is my most prized possession my journal for a long time i considered it my trophy a sordid collection of my conquests if you really want to know the truth than please read it no more lies please give me another chance im a wreck without you
6208633 you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love well here it is right in front of you and youre going to turn your back on it so i guess were just fucked ill move on but you are going to have to live the rest of your life knowing that youve turned your back on love and that makes you a hypocrite have a nice life
6208634 eat me sebastian its okay for guys like you and court to fuck everyone but when i do it i get dumped for innocent little twits like cecile god forbid i exude confidence and enjoy sex
6208635 i dont know how to make this any clearer to you you mean nothing to me
6208636 silly rabbit my triumph isnt over her its over you
6208637 you were very much in love with her and youre still in love with her but it amused me to make you ashamed of it you gave up on the first person you ever loved because i threatened your reputation dont you get it youre just a toy sebastian a little toy i like to play with and now youve completely blown it with her i think its the saddest thing ive ever heard
6208638 this blog is the real deal typos mistakes and all theres no intermediary or vetting of the posts
6208639 we have folks on the team who will be contributing but were not having any posts written by anyone other than who signs it
6208640 the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
6208641 windows 7 and that all that this team seems intent on doing is re adding the missing bloat

6208644 i have long supported a systematic and streamlined approach to loan modifications to put borrowers into long term sustainable mortgages achieving an improved return for bankers and investors compared to foreclosure
6208645 the program we are announcing today will provide affordable mortgages for eligible borrowers primarily in the so called alt a market
6208646 i doubt the investors at the lower end of the rmbs deal chain will simply agree to be wiped out because the fdic says so
6208647 something tells me investor groups are preparing their legal docs already if so

6208658 the ranger in charge of the program discovered the turtle in the middle of a marijuana field
6208659 growing marijuana on u s park land is never a good idea

6208677 it feels very good but i suspect its because the turnout wasnt the largest so i got a shot at winning and i took it
6208678 considering its my first time running for three weeks im pretty pleased with what i did i guess that with the olympics on tv all the time ive been doing some armchair sports its great for motivation thats for sure
6208679 i compete against myself thats what i like doing but its always great to have people running at about the same pace especially for the first three or four kilometres
6208680 its just a great way to meet people and to stay active
6208681 i did a sub 24 which is good for me
6208682 i just watched the olympics and they did the 10 km in 25 minutes they did double my time basically in double the distance
6208683 its all about the love and everyone has a love for the sport and its kindred spirits all getting together to run its like a little family
6208684 situation because it opens up so many different possibilities and its exciting

6208694 i am extremely excited to have bart join the coaching staff
6208695 he brings an incredible wealth of knowledge and experience on the golf course bart will be an exceptional motivator and mentor for the guys on the team i look forward to working with him to help expand our reach with the spartan mens golf alumni and the entire community of spartans across the country
6208696 when coach puryear extended me the offer to become part of the spartan golf program it was without question my proudest moment as a professional
6208697 having the opportunity to not only be part of michigan state athletics but to also learn from and work side by side with coach puryear is the perfect environment for an assistant coach to have a mentor that has not only accomplished so much in life but one that knows firsthand what it takes to win an ncaa championship is absolutely incredible
6208698 coach sadie had an incredible way of preparing our teams for competition
6208699 our practices were structured in a way where we knew without question that we were working on the right things for our games when it was time to compete the team was always full of confidence and ready to go it was a huge part of the recipe for our success i look very much forward to bringing some of those same techniques to the spartan program
6208700 playing division 1 golf at eastern was an awesome time in my life
6208701 when i look back competing against players like luke donald ben curtis and jon mills created experiences that i draw upon now in my day to day instruction and while improving my own game
6208702 my wife niki our son rory our daughter ryann and i are incredibly excited and very grateful to be part of the michigan state university family
6208703 just like coach puryear my goals here are to help make sure we are by far the most well prepared team in the country i want us to be able to step to the first tee and know in our hearts that we deserve the win more than any of the other teams in the field we will have prepared practiced and trained harder and smarter than all of our competition

6208706 fox has no financial risk here in a movie that could produce revenues for it as such i doubt that fox is going to force warner bros to shelve the movie
6208707 in all likelihood a settlement will be reached whereby warner bros gets to distribute the movie and fox gets a piece of the action
6208708 i assume fox is playing hardball to extract as much money as they can from the project but i cant imagine the movie itself would be blocked i dont know what the evidence is but it sounds like the individual producers are at the crux of the matter
6208709 the bad news is that its going to be an arduous process
6208710 the good news is that fox and warner bros have until march 2009 watchmens current release date to figure it out and come to a settlement

6208716 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones cellphone coverage is tricky
6208717 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
6208718 it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg

6208730 im satisfied with the performance of the chinese players throughout the tournament they do have ups and downs which proves they are still fledging but i believe they gained lots of confidence and experience from the games which will help them go further
6208731 they are very dangerous there are many experienced players in the team the majority of us used to play or play currently in the italian league so it will be a very difficult match
6208732 italy is very good at serving and blocking to play against them we need to show some patience and to be confident in our attack
6208733 i just think adjusting ourselves and staying in peak condition are more important than any improvement right now brazil is one of the most comprehensive teams in the world and we must focus on beating them
6208734 at the end of each set the russians were playing better than us but i will still thank all my players for their efforts in the olympic games and for fighting to the very end
6208735 this was a battle when serbia had momentum we managed to show composure to control that momentum to beat them today was a wonderful achievement although we wont get to enjoy it more because we have to focus on the next matches
6208736 in law school we all learned cases by individuals names
6208737 when these cases were accessible only in specialized legal texts or search engines accessible to legal professionals only or copies could be picked up by making a trip to the basement records room of a court or tribunal the concept of practical obscurity always operated in favour of privacy protection and the need to know principle
6208738 they will go to social network sites see what they can find about your past

6208743 nation state as a fundamental unit of mans organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force international banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state
6208744 the trilateral commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the united states the trilateral commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary intellectual and ecclesiastical

6208747 the new construction report will complement this report allowing the center to provide even greater coverage for our real estate stakeholders and consumers in every corner of the state
6208748 with the help of the home builders association of alabama we plan to look at building permits housing starts new home sales and median new sale costs
6208749 in addition we will provide information on the economic impact of construction in the state employment numbers remodeling information and the price of home building materials and look at the top builders in the state

6208754 we will continue to develop content to keep the report fresh and meaningful and will include statewide economic data and demographic trends that impact the home building industry

6208787 i started the site for a simple reason i felt ill served by the undemocratic gatekeeping mentality so prevalent in our society and at that time we seemed to be on an inexorable march toward war with no avenue for dissent there was an assumption by the powers that be that the rest of the citizen body couldnt think for ourselves that we needed self appointed and so called experts to tell us what to think what to do and what we should or should not know for far too long these gatekeepers controlled the national conversation

6208796 we decided to combine the things we do best lead bike trips and provide great experiences with the critical issues of climate change access to renewable energy bicycle advocacy and how americans are going to address their energy future
6208797 the result is a bicycle philanthropy ride with the added element of an expert speaker series not only will our climate riders pedal they will have the opportunity to learn and engage in the issues

6208841 too often in the past our states failure to respond quickly to fiscal crises has only made our budget problems worse and the solutions weve had to implement more painful
6208842 today we are taking a different approach rather than simply hoping that our struggling economy improves all sides worked together in the spirit of cooperation and took action to reduce spending i want to thank my partners in the legislature for working productively with me during this special session
6208843 while todays agreement represents a positive step forward for fiscal responsibility in state government the looming deficit we face next year will demand even more difficult choices and given the significant continued uncertainty within the economy there are no guarantees that we can avoid additional current year spending reductions if revenues plummet even further i will continue to monitor our states finances carefully and will seek additional action if necessary
6208844 the extraordinary session of the state legislature called by the governor to address the fiscal challenges facing new york has been a success because we have worked together to achieve significant savings in this years budget without raising taxes or negatively impacting vital services that new yorkers rely on i applaud the governor for his leadership in focusing new yorkers on this issue and thank the assembly for their partnership

6208906 these yopd patients have significant family work and financial responsibilities and they are experiencing non motor symptoms that disrupt their everyday life
6208907 as more and more patients share this kind of information we hope to illuminate the differences between these two types of the disease
6208908 although its too early to say what might be causing these differences we would suggest that neurologists need to pay more attention to the non motor symptoms in young onset pd patients as they might appear more often than in more typical pd
6208909 after careful re consideration of the amethyst initiative i am withdrawing my support to lower the drinking age from 21 to 18 morehouse does not condone the misuse or abuse of alcohol or illegal substances while we welcome and encourage spirited public debate about appropriate standards of behavior we do not support policies that would have the effect of encouraging or making it more likely that younger citizens would use alcohol or drugs
6208910 i might consider it i dont think its necessary but i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally could serve
6208911 i have always kind of thought that 18 is usually bombarded with so much freedom already i realize that a lot of them are drinking anyway but i think that would increase the problem
6208912 im not sure that 18 year olds are responsible and mature enough to handle the consequences of being able to drink
6208913 there are going to be people that are drinking at 18 or 19 even if it is against the law
6208914 i think if its legal it wont be as cool as it is if youre young and its illegal
6208915 because when people turn 18 they become adults and we trust them and the drinking age is just another responsibility we take on when we turn 18

6208940 but barack obama had a crucial advantage over his rivals this year the support of the national media especially the three broadcast networks
6208941 at every step of his national political career network reporters showered the illinois senator with glowing media coverage building him up as a political celebrity and exhibiting little interest in investigating his past associations or exploring the controversies that could have threatened his campaign
6208942 when it mattered most as he debuted on the national scene
6208943 this study proves emphatically and without question that the big three networks had a horse in this years democratic primary race and that with their wall to wall 24 hour daily assistance nbc abc and cbs provided sen barack obamas margin of victory
6208944 as the liberal medias ardor with sen hillary clinton evaporated so too did the inevitability of her victory the press fixated their infatuated gazes on sen obama and afforded him the crucial coverage and support he needed to win

6208955 the bush administration appears to have pulled off its latest military fiasco in the caucasus what was supposed to have been a swift and painless takeover of rebellious south ossetia by americas favorite new ally georgia has turned into a disaster that left georgia battered russia enraged and nato badly demoralized not bad for two days work equally important russias vladimir putin swiftly and decisively checkmated the bush administrations clumsy attempt last week to expand us influence into the caucasus and made the americans and their georgian satraps look like fools

6208972 the blue alert program will be a powerful tool that leverages the eyes and ears of many toward the apprehension of criminals who threaten our protectors
6208973 this decision is very disappointing and frankly represents a blind eye by the federal government to the high food prices that texas families are struggling with each day
6208974 the epas decision highlights why congress must act to freeze the corn based ethanol mandate it will allow us to re evaluate the consequences of using food for fuel and reduce increasing grocery grain and feed prices texas will remain a leader as we work to diversify our nations energy supply to include alternative and renewable sources but in the meantime congress must act i will continue to work with senator hutchison to move legislation forward that freezes the national ethanol mandate

6209012 sen sherrod brown and i have introduced legislation to help reduce fatalities in future motorcoach accidents and i urge congress to make this a priority after the august recess so the roads will be safer for everyone
6209013 congress must move quickly to pass comprehensive passenger safety standards for motorcoaches

6209027 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of web 2 0
6209028 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6209029 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6209030 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6209031 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6209032 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6209033 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6209034 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6209035 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet

6209108 i think she did the absolute right thing and she did it the right way
6209109 she underwent lumpectomy and then when she got the information back from the genetic testing she was able to have a little time to discern what this all meant and then she went forward to have the prophylactic mastectomies which are clearly the best treatment to reduce her risk of ever developing breast cancer again by at least 90
6209110 it may not be right for every patient but i think especially if you have this genetic mutation its such a highly active mutation in terms of increasing the risk of breast cancer that its certainly something that i would recommend to one of my family members or to my patients and i do
6209111 because her risk of an additional breast cancer is extremely high in the range of one in two why take a chance
6209112 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6209113 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6209114 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that

6209116 its his anatomy hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart
6209117 and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see people enjoying themselves having a good time and he recognized the responsibility of seizing the moment and he did it
6209118 i told myself if im going to get this record its going to be here because the track is really fast
6209119 i told myself im going to go out there and give it my all and i went out there and just left everything on the track

6209126 im not going to run on the court every five seconds you know what i mean
6209127 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6209128 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6209129 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6209130 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
6209131 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
6209132 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
6209133 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
6209134 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
6209135 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock

6209152 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6209153 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6209154 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6209155 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6209156 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6209157 speaking to a cuban american audience in miami in august 2007 he said
6209158 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation

6209160 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
6209161 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6209162 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
6209163 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
6209164 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation we can turned out sic the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
6209165 im proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of doctor martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination
6209166 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6209167 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6209168 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6209169 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6209170 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose any serious threat to us
6209171 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
6209172 given the situation on the ground i think if we had our troops out in four years that would be an extraordinary accomplishment
6209173 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
6209174 what the world should interpret is my consistent position which is i believe in trade
6209175 i just want to make sure that the rules of the road apply to everybody and they are fair and that they reflect the interests of workers and not just corporate profits
6209176 i said well i would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al qaeda if they were in iraq so ya know this is how politics works mccain thought that he could make a clever point by saying well let me give you some news barack al qaeda is in iraq like i wasnt reading the papers like i like i didnt know what was going on
6209177 well first of all i do know that al qaeda is in iraq thats why ive said we should continue to strike al qaeda targets but i have some news for john mccain and that is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq
6209178 i intend to bring it to an end so that we can actually start going after al qaeda in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place thats the news john mccain
6209179 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
6209180 i will serve out my full six year term you know tim if you get asked enough sooner or later you get weary and you start looking for new ways of saying things but my thinking has not changed
6209181 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
6209182 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage thats what id like to see
6209183 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
6209184 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different but overall the same wealthy interests are funding his campaign as are funding other candidates whether or not they are lobbyists
6209185 a ccording to the center for responsive politics 14 of obamas top 20 contributors employed lobbyists this year spending a total of 16 2 million to influence the federal government in the first six months of 2007
6209186 contrary to the claims of some i have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking but as president of the united states i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interests of the united states
6209187 w ould you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
6209188 i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
6209189 senator youve said before that youd meet with president ahmadinejad
6209190 yeah nothings changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries i find many of president ahmadinejads statements odious and ive said that repeatedly and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that dont have american interests at heart but what i also believe is that as john f kennedy said we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate

6209208 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6209209 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6209210 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose any serious threat to us
6209211 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
6209212 given the situation on the ground i think if we had our troops out in four years that would be an extraordinary accomplishment
6209213 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
6209214 what the world should interpret is my consistent position which is i believe in trade
6209215 i just want to make sure that the rules of the road apply to everybody and they are fair and that they reflect the interests of workers and not just corporate profits
6209216 i said well i would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al qaeda if they were in iraq so ya know this is how politics works mccain thought that he could make a clever point by saying well let me give you some news barack al qaeda is in iraq like i wasnt reading the papers like i like i didnt know what was going on
6209217 well first of all i do know that al qaeda is in iraq thats why ive said we should continue to strike al qaeda targets but i have some news for john mccain and that is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq
6209218 i intend to bring it to an end so that we can actually start going after al qaeda in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place thats the news john mccain
6209219 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
6209220 i will serve out my full six year term you know tim if you get asked enough sooner or later you get weary and you start looking for new ways of saying things but my thinking has not changed
6209221 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
6209222 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage thats what id like to see
6209223 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
6209224 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different but overall the same wealthy interests are funding his campaign as are funding other candidates whether or not they are lobbyists
6209225 a ccording to the center for responsive politics 14 of obamas top 20 contributors employed lobbyists this year spending a total of 16 2 million to influence the federal government in the first six months of 2007
6209226 contrary to the claims of some i have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking but as president of the united states i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interests of the united states
6209227 w ould you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
6209228 i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
6209229 senator youve said before that youd meet with president ahmadinejad
6209230 yeah nothings changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries i find many of president ahmadinejads statements odious and ive said that repeatedly and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that dont have american interests at heart but what i also believe is that as john f kennedy said we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate
6209231 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6209232 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6209233 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6209234 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6209235 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6209236 speaking to a cuban american audience in miami in august 2007 he said
6209237 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
6209238 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6209239 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
6209240 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6209241 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
6209242 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
6209243 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation we can turned out sic the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
6209244 im proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of doctor martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination
6209245 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6209246 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6209247 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6209248 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

6209250 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support

6209285 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6209286 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6209287 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
6209288 help from in the form of usable bug reports and responsible time lines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible our vulnerability bulletins will credit responsible reporters of any flaws
6209289 a beta test by any other name is still a beta test
6209290 its a wise practice for google emphasizing that android is going to be solid and stable is important to google particularly because we are seeing a version one release and we know that version one releases come with their own set of challenges
6209291 obviously how apple tests its products and the forum in which it tests its products is somewhat different than what google is doing here

6209643 trinamul leaders said they had no objections on the mother plant but insisted on returning the 400 acres we explained the difficulties in doing that they told us they would discuss it and join us for talks again with necessary documents

6209680 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
6209681 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
6209682 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
6209683 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth

6209687 text in video explores how through use of the written word in time based media artists make the journey from awe to anger to internal beauty to humor sometimes the integration is implemented purely for the sake of visual beauty sometimes to explore what it means to be a community words are used to convey thought to redefine ways to approach literature and witticisms even to express distaste in a decaying system the participating artists explore various applications of text in video as a vehicle to both deliver and enhance their message
6209688 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6209689 im not sure where the advice is coming on this
6209690 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6209691 im only too happy to have the most rigorous of criteria put in place

6209698 we were thinking who are the experts in recycling who could do it and put the money back in the community
6209699 a lot of local companies dont see the advantage and significance of contributing to the community to donate surplus or donate furnishings when they are refurbishing or closing
6209700 we are here because the georgians are incompetent because their administration collapsed and the town was being looted look at this
6209701 do you think we could leave all this lying around without supervision and let me tell you
6209702 we summoned the israeli foreign minister to moscow and he was told that if he continues to supply arms to the georgians we would continue to supply hezbollah and hamas
6209703 is the stakes involved in this war putin and medvedev were looking for a pretext to invade why
6209704 number one we are a democracy and incarnate an alternative to putinism as an exit from communism
6209705 in the next few years they will make some of the best films using these new techniques
6209706 we have never cut this amount off of a budget without taxing in anyones memory we have never gone into the budget and made these types of cuts in an election year and weve never gone into the budget in august
6209707 he has accomplished what my records have showed has been unprecedented in this state never has a governor brought leaders back to the table during an election year and make cuts where they needed to be made the people of the state should be very proud of our governor as i am and im sure the rest of the leaders are this is a step in the right direction
6209708 falling behind other countries in broadband access public sector innovation and implementation of the latest interactive tools to federal web sites
6209709 lacking a statutory prescription for maintaining electronic records most agencies print and file records as they would paper documents according to a recent investigation by the government accountability office under current regulations nara does not require agencies to maintain records in their native formats so for now many agencies still print e mail messages and file the paper versions although the filing process is relatively easy the practice has a major weakness it eliminates the searchability of digital documents
6209710 i want people to be able to know today this issue is going on today president obama talked about his proposal for 4 000 student college tuition credits its going to be going to this congressional committee these are the key leaders in the house and senate who are going to be deciding on the bill here are the groups that support it you should contact your congressman the more that we can enlist the american people to stay involved thats the only way we can move an agenda forward
6209711 embrace the potential of internet enabled government transparency by reducing the federal role in presenting important government information to citizens
6209712 today government bodies consider their own websites to be a higher priority than technical infrastructures that open up their data for others to use we argue that this understanding is a mistake it would be preferable for government to understand providing reusable data rather than providing websites as the core of its online publishing responsibility rather than struggling as it currently does to design sites that meet each end user need we argue that the executive branch should focus on creating a simple reliable and publicly accessible infrastructure that exposes the underlying data private actors either nonprofit or commercial are better suited to deliver government information to citizens and can constantly create and reshape the tools individuals use to find and leverage public data the best way to ensure that the government allows private parties to compete on equal terms in the provision of government data is to require that federal websites themselves use the same open systems for accessing the underlying data as they make available to the public at large
6209713 a government data provider can provide a digital signature alongside each data item a third party site that presents the data can offer a copy of the signature along with the data allowing the user to verify the authenticity of the data item by verifying the digital signature without needing to visit the government site directly

6209717 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6209718 before the georgia invasion i was against the installation of the missile shield in poland but now after the events there i feel threatened from the east and i dont regret the decision
6209719 parchments and treaties are all very well but we have a history in poland of fighting alone and being left to our own devices by our allies
6209720 then we were stabbed in the back by the soviet union and that determined our fate for 50 years
6209721 were determined this time around to have alliances backed by realities backed by capabilities
6209722 wir werden noch immer von finanzwerten getrieben insbesondere von den unsicherheiten bei fannie und freddie

6209725 against all odds a tibetan has once again raised our outlawed national flag in beijing tonight
6209726 this action symbolises the determination and steadfast commitment of the tibetan people and our supporters from around the world to achieve freedom and justice for six million tibetans living under the brutal rule of the chinese government
6209727 the chinese government is petrified of these peaceful acts of defiance simply because they represent the true feelings of tibetans inside tibet
6209728 our protests are a reminder to the world of the tragic reality of the chinese governments illegitimate occupation of tibet and the urgent need for the chinese leadership to seek a resolution with the tibetan people
6209729 the first syrian russian summit between presidents al assad and medvedev will push cooperation between the two countries forward

6209773 one of the best online resources for education in the humanities
6209774 notification from the neh came out of the blue a complete surprise
6209775 i presume one of the projects friends thought this was a good idea
6209776 edsitement with neh and the verizon foundations thinkfinity as its partners serves as a gateway to the highest quality humanities related educational content on the internet
6209777 it provides a central resource bank for teachers parents and students across the country seeking excellent humanities sites from among the thousands of educational sites now available on the internet edsitement provides lesson plans a special section for educators a monthly calendar this months feature the neh spotlight and a search engine edsitement typically gets more than 400 000 visitors per month
6209778 met the edsitement criteria for intellectual quality content design and most importantly classroom impact
6209779 i researched and eventually published an historicized re edition of mattie griffiths 1856 novel a pseudo slave narrative titled autobiography of a female slave
6209780 i wanted to understand why a white kentucky woman who turned out to be a slave owner would write an antislavery novel in the voice of an enslaved black woman
6209781 the authors biography turned out to be fascinating particularly because she became a respected abolitionist so i realized there was an enormous amount of similar literary research that needed work and i began working in the field
6209782 most often the only piece of antislavery literature students or teachers have encountered is harriet beecher stowes novel uncle toms cabin yet there is a huge body of antislavery literature that had massive distribution
6209783 but most importantly people arent sure whether that essential part of the american dream the idea of we work hard and we sacrifice the next generations going to be a little bit better off than we were people arent sure whether that still holds true
6209784 john mccain has provided honorable service to our country but when it comes to his economic policies he is promising and proposing the same things weve been doing for the last eight years
6209785 weve got to partner with our governors to come up with these plans the way that mark warner did such a wonderful job when he was governor and the way that tim kaine is currently doing such a great job as governor of virginia
6209786 more debt on the backs of your children and grandchildren
6209787 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6209788 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt seem to understand the consequences of an american defeat in iraq how it would risk a wider war and threaten the security of american families
6209789 i am going to end this war but when i bring our troops home they will come home with honor and victory leaving iraq secured as a democratic ally in the arab heartland
6209790 apple sold these devices on the promise that they were twice as fast as the pre existing phones and that they would function suitably or properly on the 3g network but thus far apple and the phone have failed to deliver on this promise
6209791 i am a true apple fan so this is nothing to make apple look bad i think apple should come out and tell people whats going on with these phones

6209806 in the first half both teams played well when the pitch was good and it was possible to play football and we achieved a goal
6209807 but in the second half it was impossible to play football like in the first half the result was fair because in the second half we were under pressure
6209808 the conditions in the second half completely ruined the game
6209809 that does not cause the same congestion problems as bittorrent
6209810 as a result of their use of software that works better on existing networks virtually no network management is needed
6209811 the majoritys silence on this key exculpatory point is deafening
6209812 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6209813 were seeing this slightly bid tone in the u s dollar but theres no real direction in the market its just uninspiring
6209814 there seems to be a belief that 3 d films are not getting their moneys worth unless they hurtle objects or body parts at the audience every time that happens it creates a fatal break in the illusion of the film the idea of a movie even an animated one is to convince us halfway at least that that were seeing on the screen is sort of really happening images leaping off the screen destroy that illusion

6209834 e ven in the worst years new line always had that party toby emmerich felt like the summer party is part of new lines dna and to change that is a mistake
6209835 equivalent to saying its o k to piss in st peters as long as you only do it in one corner
6209836 are sacred to at least 13 formally recognized indian tribes and this religious significance is of centuries duration
6209837 using treated sewage effluent to make artificial snow on the most sacred mountain of southwestern indian tribes does not violate the religious freedom restoration act rfra it also holds that a supposed pleading mistake prevents the tribes from arguing under the national environmental act nepa that the forest service failed to consider the likelihood that children and others would ingest snow made from the effluent
6209838 under our prior case law a substantial burden on the exercise of religion exists where government action prevents an individual from engaging in religious conduct or having a religious experience and the interference is more than an inconvenience
6209839 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious belief and exercise as merely subjective is an excuse for refusing to accept the indians religion as worthy of protection under the rfra
6209840 collapsed when she suffered a very serious brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst in an inaccessible part of her brain

6209842 e p a s about face means that some permit programs do not comply
6209843 i think it is fair to say that the d c circuit has repudiated the vast bulk of the bush administrations clean air regulatory reforms which were the administrations most notable and significant if not always wise environmental policy initiatives
6209844 was giving business a bit of a break was saying to states you cant do more
6209845 one of the ways states experiment is not only being more protective but being more protective more cheaply they win if they figure out a way to make environmental controls less costly
6209846 the idea was to make this information accessible to public and to state governments
6209847 even though the e p a admitted that existing monitoring wasnt good enough
6209848 i strongly align myself with the majoritys quotation from justice frankfurter about the best tool of statutory interpretation 1 read the statute 2 read the statute 3 read the statute
6209849 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars
6209850 the current economic condition further impacted the stores but they were not performing well before this year and we dont expect them to perform well
6209851 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
6209852 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
6209853 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
6209854 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the food and drug act
6209855 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling
6209856 even if the fda is doing the best it can it simply cant see the future clearly enough to pre empt manufacturers from litigation
6209857 the court system represents one of the key defense mechanisms that individuals have if a manufacturer has not made the risks of a product clear to the public
6209858 its remarkable how many people have in the past brought items to us at our loading dock they gave us clothes and gave us food and said here use these items to help people in need theyre the same people having to ask for help
6209859 every day i wish the phone rang and they said we made a mistake
6209860 after a long and sleepless night i have determined you are not a good fit and not what we want
6209861 might be unable to maintain high level contacts in the military intelligence community
6209862 if anything since my transition things have been a lot clearer
6209863 it feels like a big distraction has been removed from my life
6209864 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
6209865 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
6209866 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees
6209867 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
6209868 hi im caroline spelman and im as guilty as hell
6209869 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
6209870 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
6209871 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
6209872 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
6209873 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
6209874 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
6209875 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
6209876 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
6209877 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6209878 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
6209879 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
6209880 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
6209881 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
6209882 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
6209883 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
6209884 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
6209885 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
6209886 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
6209887 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
6209888 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
6209889 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
6209890 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
6209891 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
6209892 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
6209893 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
6209894 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
6209895 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
6209896 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
6209897 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
6209898 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
6209899 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
6209900 barack obama is committed to increasing opportunities for veterans to exercise the very rights they fought to protect regardless of who they are likely to support
6209901 the issue is not which way they are leaning in the presidential race
6209902 the issue is someone who served our nation in the military and may be recovering from injuries its just outrageous we are not going out of our way to help them vote
6209903 its currently a demand response meaning the vet has to request the service and its a much harder procedure to get the process done
6209904 were in support of the bill this will allow outside parties to assist the va
6209905 by and large there was not a great demand from outside groups to conduct voter registration drives at our facilities nor was there a large number of veterans who wanted to register when they did have drives
6209906 republicans have previously opposed efforts to make voter registration efforts available at public agencies so its not inconsistent with prior positions republican have taken
6209907 i wouldnt interpret the fact that they havent signed on as opposition
6209908 hi glam im graduating from college in december and i need a new wardrobe for work i am on a limited budget and i want to look professional attractive fashionable and promotable can you help me what should i buy i like to wear a lot of black

6209911 its clear to me that if the plaintiff jacob was denied this relief he would suffer irreparable harm
6209912 his condition has already deteriorated significantly in the past year
6209913 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6209914 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6209915 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6209916 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6209917 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124
6209918 its clear that hes getting weaker as it goes on
6209919 that could only be written about her before but i just havent run into her for a while
6209920 youd have to say to yourself this is in fact world war iii

6209922 a lot of the smaller players will have a tough time surviving long term in the solar space
6209923 built a diverse family of silicon suppliers that we believe will lead to greater supply stability and enhance our long term cost competitiveness
6209924 we have far more demand in the pipeline than we intend to supply
6209925 if they do get those types of silicon price reductions then they could be in a very good position to keep or raise gross margins next year

6209931 i would be amazed if we dont see a blu ray player in the us at or below 250usd by the end of this year and in order to stimulate consumer traffic in the holiday season whos to say there wont be a product at closer to 200usd in the uk player prices will fall to around 149gbp and there may be one or two companies trying to better that
6209932 they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting

6209935 hell see a look on my face and say yes i know rielle
6209936 rielle wanted me to know all these things because she wanted me to write about them

6209938 she does not give off good energy she didnt make eye contact with me
6209939 we all said it was going to be a summer to remember cause it was our senior year it was a summer to remember but in a different way

6209942 no one would want this for their senior year but our class will make the best out of it
6209943 thats one thing that will still be completely normal for us weve got the football field and were ready to go
6209944 get everything back together and try to get back to normal again

6209962 organically grown cotton never uses synthetic fertilizers pesticides herbicides fungicides or defoliants instead organic cotton growers use natural methods like crop rotation natural fertilizers and beneficial insects to ensure a healthy crop
