5300262 when the neo nazis use their own private property to strut around in uniform or dance to eardrum exploding songs about burning turks there is not much the police can do

5300281 there have been major concerns expressed within the technical community about whether the internet will transition to ipv6 in time to avoid a digital doomsday

5300283 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked

5300290 we dont want people to focus on the exact track this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5300291 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5300292 this is the greatest threat to pakistans being and we have to have political reconciliation to fight this menace together
5300293 his greatest weakness has been that he weakened all institutions of the state weakened them to a point where the country is moving from one crisis after another that he posed that he was a democrat but in his true colors was a dictator like anyone else
5300294 the funny thing and crazy thing is that the white sox arent supposed to be in it

5300298 a distinguished species of older females who seek the company of younger males whilst avoiding the entanglements of a relationship in favor of a lack of restrictions the cougar woman has overcome societys proscribed behavior for womens sexual behavior thus she embraces her true self and lives her life to the fullest she know what she wants and isnt afraid to hunt for it there are several species of cougars but an insatiable sexual appetite and a lack of interest in marriage and other conventional romantic institutions are common to all
5300299 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
5300300 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
5300301 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
5300302 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him

5300332 i do not mean that there is any lack of wealthy individuals in the united states but wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it
5300333 it is best to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can some will get wealthy i dont believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich but we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everyone else
5300334 she was smiling at the starting blocks she was happy and loose and thats why she won
5300335 its the fact that the entire war is an atrocity
5300336 it would always be an ak because they have so many of these lying around
5300337 judging by the skid marks they hardly even slowed down but i mean your order is that you never stop
5300338 you want to catch them in their sleep you grab the man of the house you rip him out of bed in front of his wife you put him up against the wall then you go into a room and you tear the room to shreds youll ask do you have any weapons do you have any anti us propaganda
5300339 so youll take his sofa cushions and dump them youll open up his closet and youll throw all the clothes on the floor and basically leave his house looking like a hurricane just hit it
5300340 the mentality of my squad leader was like oh we have to kill them over here so i dont have to kill them back in colorado
5300341 he just seemed to view every iraqi as a potential terrorist
5300342 people would make jokes about it even before wed go into a raid like oh fuck were gonna get the wrong house cause it would always happen we always got the wrong house
5300343 i had to go tell this woman that her husband was actually dead we gave her money we gave her like 10 crates of water we gave the kids i remember maybe it was soccer balls and toys we just didnt really know what else to do
5300344 we were approaching this one house and were approaching and they had a family dog and it was barking ferociously cause its doing its job and my squad leader just out of nowhere just shoots it so i see this dog im a huge animal lover this dog has like these eyes on it and hes running around spraying blood all over the place and like you know what the hell is going on the family is sitting right there with three little children and a mom and a dad horrified and im at a loss for words
5300345 ill tell you the point where i really turned there was this little you know pudgy little two year old child with the cute little pudgy legs and she has a bullet through her leg an ied improvised explosive device went off the gun happy soldiers just started shooting anywhere and the baby got hit and this baby looked at me like asking me why you know why do i have a bullet in my leg i was just like this is this is it this is ridiculous
5300346 i open a bag and im trying to get bandages out and the guys in the guard tower are yelling at me get that fuck haji out of here our doctor rolls up in an ambulance and from 30 to 40 meters away looks out and says shakes his head and says you know he looks fine hes gonna be all right and walks back kind of like get your ass over here and drive me back up to the clinic so im standing there and the whole time both this doctor and the guards are yelling at me you know to get rid of this guy
5300347 heres some guy some 14 year old kid with an ak47 decides hes going to start shooting at this convoy it was the most obscene thing youve ever seen every person got out and opened fire on this kid using the biggest weapons we could find we ripped him to shreds
5300348 cover your own butt was the first rule of engagement someone could look at me the wrong way and i could claim my safety was in threat
5300349 i guess while i was there the general attitude was a dead iraqi is just another dead iraqi you know so what only when we got home in meeting other veterans it seems like the guilt really takes place takes root then
5300350 the photo was very graphic they open the body bags of these prisoners that were shot in the head and one soldier has got a spoon hes reaching in to scoop out some of his brain looking at the camera and smiling
5300351 the car was approaching what was in my opinion a very poorly marked checkpoint
5300352 the frustration that resulted from our inability to get back at those who were attacking us led to tactics that seemed designed simply to punish the local population
5300353 i just remember thinking i just brought terror to someone under the american flag
5300354 a lot of guys really supported that whole concept that if they dont speak english and they have darker skin theyre not as human as us so we can do what we want
5300355 i felt like there was this enormous reduction in my compassion for people the only thing that wound up mattering is myself and the guys that i was with and everybody else be damned
5300356 but in the long term it is disastrous for the
5300357 the tone of the debate and the way it was framed in sort of an us against them way has done great harm in wooing hispanics to the party
5300358 the bill would provide amnesty and a path to citizenship for people who broke into our country by running past the national guard
5300359 the democrats said pro immigrant stuff and even if they didnt support it it was because they said it wasnt good enough the republicans said anti immigrant stuff and so now they are going to get killed with this
5300360 the hispanic vote is turning against us in very large numbers
5300361 it hurts the republican party a little bit more in terms of bringing more minorities into the party
5300362 you have to look at this in terms of outreach
5300363 i think that some of the rhetoric on the immigration debate has a very negative impact in terms of potentially alienating different constituencies the governor said in his speech to washington that we need to cool the rhetoric he feels that the debate was hurtful to his party and the country as a whole
5300364 the rhetoric from radical left was to portray republicans as anti immigration across the board
5300365 we just had a lengthy national dialogue on the topic of immigration and what was established by that is that republicans support legal immigration and oppose illegal immigration
5300366 clearly the leadership of the republican party meaning bush and martinez are completely supportive it is unfortunate that there has been a lot of bad communication in the spanish press that all republicans are against this bill
5300367 i dont think latinos are interested in joining the republicans
5300368 and i dont think republicans are interested in attracting them
5300369 no man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main

5300383 it will be interesting to see if audiences find out about this record without posters magazine ads interviews and advance cds sent to writers and reviewers and solely through internet word of mouth

5300385 all men are created equal they are endowed by their creator with
5300386 one of the most savage mass slayings of modern political history
5300387 it really was a big help to the army they probably killed a lot of people and i probably have a lot of blood on my hands
5300388 a conservative estimate would place at not less than two thousand
5300389 you make yourself ridiculous by thinking you can do anything the world is divided in two there are the communists on that side and on this side the free world the russians and the americans no one else what are we americans behind me there is the government behind the government is nato behind nato is the u s you cant fight us we are americans
5300390 was it really worth it to send people to their death for this to get noriega
5300391 every human life is precious and yet i have to answer yes it has been worth it
5300392 for three years we have been saying that war is coming and the team has been working hard to deliver on this promise
5300393 in just a few weeks we are going to throw open our doors and invite more players into the game than ever before they will have a chance to delve into the open beta and see for themselves that war has arrived and it is glorious
5300394 in 2001 j lo was the biggest of the big and is now the star likely to be found soon on trivial pursuit
5300395 and her album of 2007 called brave without a tinge of irony was dubbed worst of the year with one critic saying too shallow even by ashley tisdale standards
5300396 our women and common people are important to us too about one month ago the coalition forces attacked a wedding in jalalabad that killed 49 people women children men boys everyone that was present
5300397 to take revenge on the coalition forces and foreign people and to show the world that our people are just as important as yours
5300398 there is much interest in this as the public officials and the media will attend and cover this major breakthrough for the defense
5300399 acting is definitely harder for women women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
5300400 i would love to do another album it was fantastic to not only live with that music that i love every day but to work with such wonderful musicians its like a whole little creative commune we had

5300402 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5300403 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5300404 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5300405 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5300406 the president is not answerable to any court for the exercise of power and performance of functions of their respective offices for any act done or purported to be done in the exercise of those powers and performance of those functions
5300407 the last few days have seen the most customers in over three decades and sales are growing by 10 percent each day
5300408 he seemed very satisfied with the suits and said thank you to me in chinese
5300409 the olympics brought us a rare opportunity and will push the market to work to improve its image
5300410 you are calling the press conservative are you kidding me the same press that has annointed obama the next president the same press that sent the top three news correspondants with him on his mideast trip but yet when mccain went to south america he might have gotten a reporter from a high school newspaper to cover it
5300411 you mention edwards dilema it is kinda funny that his own democrat friends seem to be his most harsh critics and the edwards story just broke but mccains infidelity happened 30 years ago
5300412 oh and if you dont believe that obama isnt an elitist why dont you check out what he said about small town america back in april
5300413 they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them

5300418 the talks are over the negotiations are over its just the signing that we are waiting for at this point it is really up to joseph kony if he is ready to sign we are ready to sign
5300419 i think joseph kony has some reservations about agenda item number three

5300426 i see movement in this area in germany too thats what the latest surveys show unfortunately the mood here is still a bit ossified i dont understand that and i wish that the debate was a bit more objective and less emotional
5300427 first weve got to see if there are respectable investors which will invest long term in the grid and second whether theres a decent price there are plenty of interested parties including private equity companies
5300428 his arch is too high so i would brush and trim then i would remove the excess hair between the eyebrows he doesnt have much but his eyebrows are too manicured whoever did it made him look almost like a woman
5300429 to be honest with you mr obama has perfect eyebrows
5300430 mr mccain needs big help he needs to color his eyebrows you cannot have half white and half brown eyebrows
5300431 ive been pressing since the first day of the season and it has snowballed on me
5300432 its tough to hit when youre not confident i think most of it is mental if youre confident your fundamentals are usually pretty good at this point im not too confident so its tough to go up there and take the same approach and take the same swings each at bat you feel like if it didnt work you have to try something else
5300433 it doesnt make you feel good when you know youre letting the team down
5300434 i do what i can on the defensive side of the field but im not hitting if i was hitting like im capable of hitting i think our team would be a lot better thats something ive got to deal with im still putting in the work im trying to figure it out
5300435 what is her to begin with i must let it be known to you that holding a temporary job does have its perks
5300436 it was a busy morning about 8 30 when an elderly gentleman in his 80s arrived to have stitches removed from his thumb

5300446 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
5300447 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it
5300448 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter
5300449 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5300450 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
5300451 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
5300452 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis
5300453 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time
5300454 we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions
5300455 this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all the diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5300456 we now have evidence that these pfrs are pervasive in the environment and may exist in higher concentrations than most organic pollutants
5300457 i have another project based on the life of comedian bill hicks which is going from treatment to draft stage with kiwi writer mark staufer

5300463 chris i got bad news and good news bad news is were built on a swamp good news is that were sinking
5300464 hey george somethings wrong here what do you mean it looks just fine from my side
5300465 now when jesus was in bethany at the home of simon the leper a woman came to him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume and she poured it on his head as he reclined at the table
5300466 why this waste for this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor
5300467 jesus is worthy of every breath that we take every beat of our hearts and every drop of our blood
5300468 the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below
5300469 i have never seen such a big rally in srinagar
5300470 i couldnt resist coming out to demand freedom from india
5300471 we only have about 200 of the original raiders left
5300472 on a legal sized piece of paper the full front page and half of the back page he had every place jess was sent while he was in the marines every ship he was on and every landing he made i was thrilled to death with what he did
5300473 they gave me a blanket and a railroad ticket and sent me to parris island south carolina
5300474 and they didnt need us little pin prickers anymore you know
5300475 thats all i work on nowadays besides mowing the lawn and whatnot im widowed so im living alone at the moment
5300476 you know im old fashioned im still kind of pencil and paper and whatnot
5300477 is there a photo of you with all of your files
5300478 no the only picture i have i think is in world war ii
5300479 unless some other raider wants to take it over and continue to get the historical records you know
5300480 after 60 some years a lot of that stuff has disappeared
5300481 it is a promo for our loyal users and online merchandisers
5300482 shes all right she said she got lost in the woods
5300483 she didnt have food and water with her so she was too weak to get herself out
5300484 courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose
5300485 not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5300486 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago it was just a lack of energy my body was just completely fatigued it hurt to touch it hurt to lay down it hurt to do everything
5300487 i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5300488 i got to one slow constant speed couldnt pick it up from there
5300489 theres a physical and mental component to performing and i think the flu was just another response to his immune system that has been down because of the pressure
5300490 its been displaying itself in various mechanisms problems with his breathing heavy legs illness
5300491 but this is his first olympics and this is how he responded to it
5300492 hes never responded like this now its going to be about taking some time away think about whats important and see how hell respond to this a lot of top athletes have bottomed out before theyve made it to the top and maybe this is what he needs to happen
5300493 right now hes sad hes concerned that hes let us down but i dont feel that way at all
5300494 ill get over it and assess what i want to do and get on with the next race theres a lot of good people that arent going to make the finals or dont get out of the heats it happens to a select few it just happens this year that im one of them
5300495 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind
5300496 we know very well well not be about to win the war against insects they have been here much longer than us cockroaches were here 350 million years ago
5300497 i have another project based on the life of comedian bill hicks which is going from treatment to draft stage with kiwi writer mark staufer
5300498 it was unlikely to provide now that the former president would be provided with the same security that he got when he was the president
5300499 i did take all her miniskirts i told her one night that her skirt was too short she came down the stairs and i was like god mum you are 50
5300500 we are pleased to see our relationship with uppal hospitality ltd expand and to watch our hotels portfolio in india grow rapidly
5300501 weve been operating in india for less than 10 years and are thrilled by what we have been able to achieve in such a short time
5300502 how do you make objective decisions on the best companies when the first decision is whether they can pay or not
5300503 sometimes the hottest start ups either cant afford it or dont need it
5300504 oh no nooo im not a jonas brother i just did it for fun i played guitar on the track and thats it
5300505 for the families who have lost their loved ones or lost limbs or suffered severe injuries your statement and act has caused extreme emotional distress
5300506 im so excited to be living in my own home
5300507 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says
5300508 im probably the only person in this town that does
5300509 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5300510 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
5300511 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy
5300512 im considering it but i dont want any of them
5300513 what if they get in there and make it worse
5300514 ese tramo es zona restringida por ser parte de un plan de desv os corresponde a la polic a hacer cumplir tal disposici n
5300515 i feel as hard i have worked i have a chance to get the world record
5300516 training has been going really well probably the best of the season
5300517 it makes me train harder when i go to the track i know lashawn will be there working as hard as i am
5300518 the first is myself because as long as im running my race and i dont let myself do something different i feel like ill be hard to beat
5300519 the second is everyone else in the field because i can be beaten on any given day i just have to stay on top of things
5300520 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5300521 obama started to say that justice thomas didnt have enough experience for the supreme court
5300522 this is all reminiscent of senate majority leader harry reids comment several years ago that justice thomas was an embarrassment to the court and that his opinions were poorly written
5300523 apparently obama can do no better than to recycle discredited statements of harry reid when it comes to justice thomas like other liberal elites obama cannot stand it when a black man strays from the ideological plantation and refuses to implement liberal policies through the courts but obama will never point out any intellectual deficiencies in justice thomass work because he cant justice thomass opinions consistently reveal faithfulness to the constitution judicial modesty and deference to the will of the people in our representative democracy that is opposed to everything that obama and the liberals are trying to do in grabbing power from the people and giving it to the courts
5300524 well i think that the president of the united states has incredible responsibility in nominating people to the united states supreme court they are lifetime positions as well as the federal bench there will be two or maybe three vacancies this nomination should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench
5300525 even more troubling is what the illinois democrats answer betrays about his political habits of mind asked a question he didnt expect at a rare unscripted event the rookie candidate didnt merely say he disagreed with justice thomas instead he instinctively reverted to the leftwing clich that the courts black conservative isnt up to the job while his white conservative colleagues are
5300526 obama wants justices who will do his bidding who will implement the preferred policies of the liberal establishment not justices like thomas scalia roberts and alito who understand that the role of a judge is not to legislate from the bench
5300527 obamas answer about the three wisest people in his life upon whom he would rely heavily in his administration also sheds light on the way he would choose supreme court justices obama said he would consult his grandmother his wife and ted kennedy this is unlikely to yield the highest quality judicial nominees who understand the constitution and the role of judges in our constitutional democracy
5300528 we looked up and it looked like lots of confetti falling out of the sky
5300529 a twin engined plane then came toward us falling all the time it was going to hit us or could have gone onto the housing estate
5300530 but i think the pilot must have realised what was going to happen because the plane then banked very very sharply like they do in those acrobatic displays
5300531 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway
5300532 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry
5300533 we are conducting a joint investigation with the air accidents investigation branch and warwickshire fire and rescue service to try to find out what has happened
5300534 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5300535 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5300536 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5300537 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment
5300538 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5300539 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical
5300540 its 30 degrees celsius over here really sweating whats the weather like over there ha ha
5300541 well the earl didnt become an earl without charging 20 pounds for tea and scones sir
5300542 i think the financial problem is halfway through the cycle
5300543 is up to about 50 billion and will probably top 100 billion before its over
5300544 those firms merrill wachovia and others are going to have to raise that cash
5300545 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet more regularly oversight or theyre going to have to get it in the capital markets
5300546 but a thousand banks is going to be a lot
5300547 each dollar of bank equity that gets lost takes out about 12 or 13 dollars of loans so theres a tremendous magnifier effect of small changes in bank equity
5300548 were it not for government aid and backing they would have already had to declare bankruptcy their portfolios have problems

5300551 blustered that he would handle the human rights issue as an element for negotiations with north korea
5300552 we categorically dismiss this as a premeditated act of the u s to deliberately throw a hurdle in the process of the six party talks
5300553 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
5300554 i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5300555 how the vacuum is handled by the civilian government how much control they can exercise on the radical elements remains to be seen
5300556 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5300557 this was a barbaric act carried out by the enemies of afghanistan at a time of celebration of independence
5300558 let us shun tribal linguistic and regional issues and wage jihad against the enemies of this country and its religion and their mercenaries so we can mark the independence anniversary in its actual form

5300590 it was our strategy that we must win this gold medal because that demonstrates the power of our country

5300597 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title is finishing 12th and winning the league cup a successful season for us i dont think so you see the real quality of a team after 38 games in the league cup or the fa cup if you win five games you can be in the final does that tell you the real quality no because real quality only comes out in the championship if you dont win the league of course you are frustrated but the levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and two or three points is not a big gap we finished with 83 points last season and everywhere else in europe that would have made us champions

5300617 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
5300618 would you like sugar and irony with your coffee this morning
5300619 id like to get the algerian but dont know if i can
5300620 it would only be a loan thats what were looking for
5300621 we have a problem on the right too we need someone with pace we have no one there like that at the moment
5300622 we didnt follow players we didnt talk and we didnt communicate
5300623 i suppose when you play a big team the decision goes against you most of the time
5300624 i have to say it is hard as player we talk about respect but when it is completely unfair it is hard
5300625 the worst thing is when you say politely what you think and try to understand the decision you get a yellow card
5300626 i had a yellow card at the community shield the same way i say i respect people the way they respect me
5300627 we are supposed to respect the rules and the referee but it goes both ways they have to respect the players too
5300628 for the fans of fenerbahce i am sad to announce that after giving my all to this club i personally love the management have made it impossible for me stay
5300629 two seasons ago even when i was injured i agreed to play for fenerbahce just to make sure we won the title and i am happy that i did because of my commitment to the club
5300630 since then there has been some dishonest briefings to the turkish media about the complications from the surgery
5300631 since they have stopped paying my salary i am now a free agent and i expect that status to be confirmed by fifa later this month
5300632 er zijn muizenvallen in het huis er zijn muizenvallen in huis

5300634 ik ben zo zeer droevig voor jou mijnh r muis
5300635 maar er is niets wat ik voor je kan doen maar wees verz kerd dat je in mijn geb den zal zijn

5300639 hes returning to group one company and its a possible championship race he takes his chance and hopefully hell acquit himself well

5300644 would be a prolife president and this presidency would have prolife policies
5300645 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
5300646 i think it is pretty clear at this point mccain did indeed know the questions in advance
5300647 the men are just much more comfortable than the women
5300648 women sometimes take overly conservative positions and sometimes then they dont make as much money as men
5300649 its true that most men are willing to take more risks than women
5300650 the battle between greed and fear is involved in all investing
5300651 there is a little more greed in the guys and a little more fear in the girls

5300659 fifty years have passed and dozens of armed groups have spurted across north east india and jammu and kashmir the afspa has manifestly failed to contain any insurgency instead it has become the symbol of oppression and repression
5300660 the afspa cannot address conflicts arising out of controversies such as the one relating to the amarnath shrine in jammu and kashmir but the actions of the armed forces and impunity enjoyed by them under the afspa can certainly alienate the people further

5300821 the terrorists showed that they are vigorously against the freedom of the afghan people and cannot bear to see the celebration of independence and the happiness of the afghan people
5300822 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5300823 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behaviour to security forces afghan or coalition and government representatives

5300873 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5300874 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5300875 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5300884 my interest in motorcycles began in 1946 when as a teenaged gwen wickham i cheered on my heroes every week at wembley speedway a few years later after my family moved from north london to southampton i met jack white a great character who taught me to ride a motorcycle became my best friend and eventually in 1958 my husband although he was 24 years my senior jackie white was a well known member of the ariel works trials team just before the war and he encouraged me to ride in trials with him my first trial was the sunbeam mccs novice trial in 1950 on jacks flying flea royal enfield another competitor that day was mike jacksons elder brother john who at 17 was also competing for the first time jack then prepared a 125cc bsa bantam for me which i rode in open to centre trials most sundays and a few nationals when i could get a saturday off from my job as a hospital laboratory technician in 1952 i progressed to a 197cc francis barnett and rode it in that years scottish six days trial along with jack who had a similar bike he had modified them by fitting friction dampers to the forks and had altered the steering head angle which made them handle well unfortunately jacks bike developed ignition trouble and he had to retire on the wednesday bu mine carried me to the finish without missing a beat the scottish was an adventure and experience that i shall never forget and i was lucky enough to ride in it again in 1957 this time on a 197cc james commando incidentally the previous owner was john jackson he and mike were fellow southampton club members and were by then very successful trial and moto cross riders the james went well until mid week when during a downhill tumble the frame got twisted and i suffered with chain trouble for the rest of the trial i managed to finish but with a large loss of marks i rode francis barnett until 1955 and then the james in some of the other nationals including the west of england the welsh two days beggars roost cotswold cups trial the hoad trial and the perce simon trial the latter being close to home for me and in those days run on the new forest what i loved most about trials was the fun camaraderie and challenge all in beautiful surroundings to which one would never normally have access on a standard road vehicle although most of us in those days rode the same bike to work each day pic shows gwen at rest during the west of england trial in devon 1952 photo and lemonade courtesy mr huntley francis barnett rep jack and i were married in 1958 and we set up home together when our two daughters came along i gave up competition riding but still rode a bike on the road i also rode the odd vintage bike including jacks 1930 ariel 250cc colt pictured in a few club runs sadly jack died in 1977 but i still have that battered up old ariel on which he won so much including third place in the 1934 scottish six days photo shows gwen riding the ariel at a vintage club run in 1995 despite advice to the contrary i refuse to have it restored to remove all its battle scars and jacks modifications would rob it of its considerable character i have never lost my love of motorcycling which these days i enjoy as a spectator along with the great friendships which have survived the years

5301013 the border patrol is doing it as part of their job they didnt notify the city of any additional activity they didnt notify the police department of any additional activity
5301014 but if federal laws are being broken the city is supportive of those laws being enforced

5301038 weve got a small squad but we believe its a good one and i want to keep everybody involved this season
5301039 i was delighted with the attitude and the character we showed for the spurs game and i want to have a look at a couple of games before making a final decision
5301040 im pleased to have added justin hoyte to the squad but we have no more bids in at the moment and it may stay that way
5301041 it may leave us a little bit short but then we have players who have proved they can play in a number of positions
5301042 today i was very very nervous because i was the favourite to win the tournament
5301043 the first half in particular was not good enough we know that
5301044 it was tough for us at the start of the game they came out of the blocks really quickly and set a really high tempo which youd expect because it was their first home game of the season
5301045 they put us under a lot of pressure and maybe we were a little bit slow to get going
5301046 it was certainly not the best game we have played but the important thing was that we got better in the second half and at the end fernando popped up with a goal and that was enough to win the game
5301047 the most important thing is that we got the win
5301048 to be honest my first choice would have been to fight at the millennium stadium
5301049 ive got so many good memories of fighting in cardiff and some of the best nights of my career were at the cia
5301050 but the powers that be want me to fight in america hbo werent happy about running a pay per view show from outside the states and you have to go with what they say
5301051 my second choice was madison square garden but i probably would have made more money in las vegas

5301067 its about a 15 per cent decline in earnings and the company has to tell shareholders why it took so long to come to the market with the information
5301068 its purely based on the performance of the company its all about the companys net profit for the year
5301069 they need to sort out the overhanging issue of the pulp mill and concentrating on their asset base and improving it
5301070 there may well be pressure on him especially now with this decline in earnings to relinquish one of his roles
5301071 coming around the corner in the next one two or three years
5301072 if theres a final dividend of less than 8c youd have to say this stock would weaken even further
5301073 theres been a significant drop in earnings per share and for the third year in a row and you cant maintain that level of dividend
5301074 i have only praise for the surgeons and staff they are just lovely but the system stinks
5301075 i was supposed to be there at 7am but was called and told not to come in until 9am and then just as we were leaving at 8 30am i got the call that it had been cancelled again

5301082 the lord has shown me a lot of good miracles happen
5301083 im looking forward to seeing my husband and my family and all those who have gone to their rest before me
5301084 belief in an afterlife has risen in the last 50 years
5301085 serious thinkers are beginning to see through the mistake modernity made in thinking that science is the oracle of truth
5301086 nope ive always felt that way lifes short enough without having to worry about something you cant do anything about anyway its just reality you know i mean im a catholic
5301087 sure they preach life after death you know i just say hey people preach a lot of stuff you just gotta make up your own mind about things i go to mass i live my life like theres life after death but i dont believe there is if its true well hey its a plus but if it aint i didnt lose nothing
5301088 i just want to be faithful to jesus every day and do whats right
5301089 atheists celebrate life but we know death is a reality
5301090 we believe the only afterlife that a person can hope to have is the legacy they leave behind the memory of the people who have been touched by their lives
5301091 when we examine brain cells we see that brain cells are like any other cells they can produce proteins and chemicals but they are not really capable of producing the subjective phenomenon of thought that we have
5301092 the brain is definitely needed to manifest the mind a bit like how a television set can take what essentially are waves in the air and translate them into picture and sound
5301093 we know that memories are extremely fallible we are quite good at knowing that something happened but we are very poor at knowing when it happened
5301094 we firmly believe that subversion 1 5 represents an inflection point for subversion with new features such as merge tracking that make complex parallel development processes much easier subversion is currently growing faster than any other source code management system and we see this trend continuing for the foreseeable future
5301095 weve long been pleased to see subversion become an increasingly common component in enterprise infrastructure

5301148 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5301149 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5301150 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5301151 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5301152 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5301153 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5301154 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5301155 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5301156 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5301157 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5301158 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5301159 when am i going to make money instead of spending it
5301160 its something i like doing its one of my favourite things

5301166 i didnt have the experience and didnt know what to expect
5301167 this time i really used that experience and brought it all the way until now
5301168 when its replaying in my head it does bother me

5301196 the massive wildfires raging in california this summer are symptomatic of a trend toward more fires burning larger areas in the western united states over the past few decades

5301203 this study was all the more exciting to be a part of due to its potential applications in protecting human health
5301204 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
5301205 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease
5301206 wolves consume many prey animals a minimum of 150 200 moose contribute to an isle royale wolfs diet over the course of its lifetime and the prey consume a whole lot of plants
5301207 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
5301208 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
5301209 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
5301210 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
5301211 in a way this whole study can be summed up by asking how many trees does a wolf represent
5301212 instrumental measurements of environmental variables are only available for about the past few hundred years so this may help us understand paleo environmental change better and if we can understand ancient environments better then our ability to predict future changes is improved

5301243 we often forget how much posture affects how we look and feel as well as how it influences how people perceive us everyone is afraid of developing a pooch or beer belly but we dont realize the role poor posture can play in that
5301244 posture directly affects how tall and thin we look and how confident we appear to others but we are all so busy we hardly have time to think about it the iposture is designed to do the thinking for us
5301245 while we were working on the book i realized that improving posture requires a multi pronged approach and i wanted to create a device that could help people improve their posture as they go about their day thats when the idea for the iposture was born

5301290 that year i hit rock bottom i wasted too much time on fantasy sports we fantasy sports fanatics definitely take it too seriously
5301291 i realized there are enough of us fantasy dorks out there playing in several leagues and there is a need for an online gathering place for our significant others to share stories and buy cool stuff that pokes fun at our addiction
5301292 it was about four years ago when my husband started to play fantasy football
5301293 had i known where this would lead i may not have been so eager for him to take up this hobby
5301294 no way wafs isnt here to spoil anyones fun were just making our own entertainment and supporting one another

5301304 you cant compare the platform he has now to anything that any swimmer has had in the past
5301305 he has worked to develop promotional platforms that can exist between the games irrespective of whether there is a competitive event
5301306 i think he can make swimming much more than a once every four year sport in terms of relevance to the general public

5301327 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5301328 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5301329 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5301330 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5301331 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5301332 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5301333 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5301339 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5301340 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5301341 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5301342 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5301343 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5301344 schedules are in flux only the martinsville event has been announced but wednesday i am really tied up wall to wall with this cabinet community day

5301346 virginia is important its obvious that virginia is going to play a pretty important role this fall and the republicans have now admitted that that virginia is no longer a safe republican state but i dont know that virginia is so important that you could give two virginians prominent spots on the convention schedule
5301347 a lot of states have budget problems this year and virginias is far from the worst but that being said this certainly doesnt help
5301348 one of the major democratic lines of attack on the bush years is probably going to be the fiscal irresponsibility the waging of war on a credit card the huge ballooning of the deficit and so the vice presidential candidate for the democrats needs to be somebody who has been able to balance budgets and isnt looking at a fiscal crisis during an election season

5301376 one reason we see near term strength is that prices approached key trend line support at the 110 level on friday and held and this could result in further short term buying by chart based traders
5301377 in addition the dollar is not exerting a bearish influence on prices as we start the new week
5301378 lastly tropical storm fay now working its way towards the florida keys is causing some nervousness

5301380 die gesellschaftliche und wirtschaftliche bedeutung des fu balls wird in deutschland trotz aller sonntagsreden der politiker immer wieder unn tig in frage gestellt und somit nicht angemessen gew rdigt mich w rde mal interessieren was passiert wenn wie in den usa oder italien die ganze liga streikt und damit den spielbetrieb an mehreren wochenenden einstellt
5301381 man muss sich dagegen wehren dass dem fu ball in deutschland unterstellt wird auf kosten der ffentlichen hand seine spiele durchzuf hren
5301382 denn es muss doch allen klar sein dass es in keinem anderen land der welt spitzenfu ball so g nstig f r die fans und konsumenten zu haben gibt wie bei uns
5301383 es geht hier um grunds tzliche dinge und nicht um eine besserstellung des fu balls gegen ber anderen m rkten aber es kann nicht sein dass die wirtschaftliche bedeutung des fu balls immer wieder von entscheidungstr gern untersch tzt wird

5301401 it is clear in part from evidence that you all have published that lead managers gave the market a false sense of liquidity when real investor demand was disappearing
5301402 ubs acted against investors best interests in part by buying ars in auctions that otherwise would have failed without disclosing that fact to the market or to its customers if the allegations in attorney general cuomos complaint are true and if lead managers other than ubs engaged in similar activity the violations at the heart of the ars market downturn stem not from problems with distributing firms at the point of sale but in the relatively opaque auction process
5301403 and thats why im treating this as a sales practice issue
5301404 when this is done it will be the largest civil recovery case in history
5301405 firms like merrill lynch citigroup and wachovia can buy and hold large volumes of ars because even though their ars positions would be significant they are still small relative to the firms total assets and those firms have sufficient financial resources to carry large securities positions
5301406 a website usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary descriptions of events or other material such as graphics or video entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order

5301413 since we are asking for the courts opinion and we believe in international institutions including the icj we will respect any decision it makes
5301414 if that court were to declare kosovos independence illegal it would be unusual that serbia would want to join illegality there is some contradiction there
5301415 there are a lot of issues between the two countries some being long term and some being short term

5301430 we need a little bit better supporting role around him weatherford he improved from the standpoint of throwing 11 interceptions the year before to just one last year two more in the bowl game he needs to be more productive this year and there is no reason he cant be unless we just cant protect him
5301431 it doesnt bother me because from what weve done lately we dont deserve to be up there its a lot more fun to try to get to the top than to be there
5301432 im really looking for the guy whos going to be the most consistent
5301433 theyre all up and down i think so far jordan steffy has been more consistent than the other two the other two have had a bad day jordan hasnt had a bad day yet im anxious to see how this plays out to me somebody needs to separate himself
5301434 we need to do a better job against the run

5301440 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5301441 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5301442 two women came in said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help

5301446 the usda doesnt determine safety by testing for bacteria it determines safety by enforcing paperwork compliance
5301447 for every result there is a process i think results without a produce cannot be maintained
5301448 we dont know a whole lot about james hiroyuki liao but we like what we see
5301449 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
5301450 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
5301451 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
5301452 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods
5301453 ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
5301454 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
5301455 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
5301456 i am processing the meeting between the lra leader with the mediator southern sudan president riek machar
5301457 the final agreement has been initialled and we are waiting any time for gen kony and president museveni to sign it
5301458 president museveni is ready to sign any time but gen kony still wants to have a meeting with his delegation the chief mediator and others before he signs probably to have some clarification since he was not involved directly in the talks he has been relying on information from his delegation so he needs more clarification and understanding
5301459 well if this meeting takes place it will mean that the lra will reconcile with the spla because you know a lra unit recently attacked a spla unit that resulted in the death of spla soldiers and some sudanese civilians and this means they needed to meet and reconcile the fact that the meeting will take place means that now there is a good cooperation between the two sides
5301460 it is a good thing that people are returning home because i think that this process is irreversible because no one thinks of resuming war or joining the lra ranks
5301461 one of the kennels that shot the dogs could now reapply for kennel license and we have no grounds to refuse them because shooting 80 dogs in pa is not a crime
5301462 these new nasdaq omx indexes will help international investors better manage their exposure to these increasingly important global sectors

5301464 das waren nicht unsere spiele es l uft einfach nicht nicht vorne und nicht hinten
5301465 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
5301466 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
5301467 the first thing theyll do is stop women from working then theyll force us to wear the veil
5301468 this new vice and virtue movement has the potential to undermine the government
5301469 civil society groups are working hard to modernise society to establish a social contract grounded in our constitution and reflected in our laws a group using religion as a weapon threatens all the progress we have achieved
5301470 zindanis committee represents a big threat that could close the space for womens organisations in civil society
5301471 the medias response was so strong the fundamentalists have lost their case theyre in a weaker position
5301472 we already have plenty of restrictions and obstacles we dont need any more
5301473 the male and female pastors were called to the police station one at a time and pressured to find out who was behind the posters the officials insisted that they knew there was a link between the pastors and the poster campaign
5301474 they were forced to sign an agreement saying that they would find out who the culprits were
5301475 they have seized gardens and farmland from the locals and the project has destroyed all the roads in the area
5301476 locals have appealed to the companies to stop the project but they just do whatever they want with the assistance of local military and the police
5301477 their main intention is to find gold and other minerals under the river bed while they are building dams across the rivers
5301478 occult practices atheistic views voodoo rituals or any other form of mysticism
5301479 it is discriminatory not only against atheists but they also are banning access to sites to do with witchcraft
5301480 witchcraft these days is called wicca which is an actual legitimate and recognised religion
5301481 we feel very strongly that people who dont believe should not be denied the access that people who do believe have got
5301482 we are currently implementing new internet monitoring software to make the control of internet access easier to manage
5301483 i said to him we want to give you what you need not what you want you need to re examine your ideology and you need someone to advise you why should i believe i have a duty to support al qaeda how islamically did they establish their authority
5301484 oh you young people do not be deceived by the heroes of the internet the leaders of the microphones who are launching statements inciting the youth while living under the protection of intelligence services or of a tribe or in a distant cave or under political asylum in an infidel country
5301485 they have thrown many others before you into the infernos graves and prisons those who have triggered clashes and pressed their brothers into unequal military confrontations are specialists neither in fatwas nor in military affairs
5301486 i think theres a lack of communication and i think that until we get this individual involvement from politicians and ministers and other people to come down and in this safe space have a critical dialogue were going to get young people who are going to try to vent their frustration elsewhere
5301487 indias technical intelligence capability has developed with help from the us and local scientific knowhow so we told our brothers to use personal couriers
5301488 that explains the complete dearth of intelligence on the groups responsible for this years serial explosions in jaipur bangalore and ahmedabad our intelligence has become too dependent on technology
5301489 we are making the same mistakes that western intelligence agencies made by pinning too much hope on technology thats important but theres no substitute for a good agent in the right place
5301490 the serial bombings in jaipur bangalore and ahmedabad prove that pakistans isi has successfully indianised the jihad by creating indian equivalents of lashkar e toiba or huji
5301491 they still provide general direction so you have a series of explosions in india immediately after the bombing of the indian embassy in kabul and the stepped up hostilities in kashmir
5301492 but the surrogates are largely independent now in choosing targets or gathering explosives
5301493 the real bane of indian intelligence is that it is largely run by police officials most of whom serve on deputation from states and are floating in and out of the ib and other federal intelligence wings they lack both the commitment and the expertise
5301494 none of the worlds best intelligence agencies are run by policemen they are all run by career intelligence officers it is only in india that the indian police service ips monopolises most senior intelligence positions
5301495 the best brains go to foreign service and administrative service and only those at the bottom of the heap are recruited into the police service
5301496 we should get the best brains for intelligence but we only get rejects now
5301497 there are very few muslims in indian intelligence only a few in the state police special branches and really a handful in the federal agencies how can we plant agents amongst jihadis unless we have muslim officers
5301498 the community has grown over the last 20 years and we need a replacement centre

5301510 our fathead nation is so passionate about sports and entertainment we just knew they would want one of the presidential candidate images
5301511 would not take any move to save the poor market
5301512 the larger concern over slowing growth in the economy will continue to weigh
5301513 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs
5301514 we are starting to see companies going out of business after six to 12 months the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more but its a very slow gradual process
5301515 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5301516 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics there seems to be a lot of related spending
5301517 theres been so much excitement generated it seems hard to me to say that we wont see some sort of short term hangover at least

5301528 we have a duty to help mrs hedgers and their family to at least have a definite answer to this disappearance to provide some amount of closure if we find a body and it can be positively identified as mr hedgers we will then have a known homicide and that will begin the clock ticking on a final phase of this investigation

5301531 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5301532 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5301533 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5301534 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5301535 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home

5301547 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5301548 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5301549 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5301550 its clear from our results that more research needs to be done into the effects of stereotype threat in uk medical schools and in fostering positive educational relationships between all students and their clinical teachers
5301551 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5301552 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5301553 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5301554 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5301555 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5301556 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5301557 in my own personal experience i see that each semester requires a different approach
5301558 this is even true when i teach the same course twice in a semester different times of the day or lengths of classes require different methods just as different quality students require different approaches
5301559 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
5301560 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students
5301561 one of the most beautiful things about america to me is the creativity that we instill in our primary and secondary schools
5301562 i know that we lag behind many countries in test scores but i believe we also produce some of the most creative enthusiastic students in the world
5301563 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5301564 our recent studies into what occurs during the chemical reaction caused by tamls proves that the catalysts are indeed really close mimics of peroxidase enzymes

5301568 the indian authorities have acted so far with sensible level headedness
5301569 the programme unfairly maligns muslims following the shia tradition by accusing them of heresy based on a collection of age old polemics and misinformation
5301570 with respect this is an irresponsible portrayal which plays into the hands of those who wish to seek discord amongst muslims which we hope you did not intend
5301571 the god the sunni worship may not be described in human language nor represented in any art form for that would be blasphemous yet sometimes the human heart yearns for more for a faith you can touch and feel for drama for music for ceremony for great stories of sacrifice pain martyrdom and salvation and for someone to pray to who has human form shia islam answers these needs but the quran makes it so clear that your prayer should only be directed to god
5301572 but do these specific beliefs have any substance in the quran the answer is no
5301573 the film maker depicted shia islam as a foreign belief system that has no place in islam it promoted the idea that shias as well as wahhabis are extremists it even featured one academic taj hargey from oxford referring to shias as sinners there are already people who think of us as kaffirs infidels and a primetime documentary airing these opinions will only inflame that view and provide justification for sectarian hatred and violence
5301574 both sides of the various discussions were fully aired within the programme the film was critically acclaimed and generated a positive response from viewers
5301575 by laying out the terms and conditions of the marriage it encourages both parties to establish consensus on issues such as where they will live
5301576 problems arise when couples dont know what to expect the lack of respect for each others personality and choices is shocking

5301581 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators
5301582 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now
5301583 the worry is that what seems like a passing phase might become a way of life
5301584 peace cannot be kept by force it can only be achieved by understanding
5301585 when we live myopically in the fleeting present oblivious of our past heritage and apostolic traditions we could well be suffering from spiritual alzheimers
5301586 when we behave in a disorderly manner going whimsically our own way without any coordination with the head of or the other members of our community it could be ecclesial parkinsons
5301587 if this context is ignored in favour of a myopic world vision christs salvation will be conveniently dismissed as irrelevant
5301588 aided and abetted by well known secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
5301589 secularism which seeks to build a godless society spiritual indifference which is insensitive to transcendental values and relativism which is contrary to the permanent tenets of the gospel
5301590 we christians and bishops can ill afford to remain on the sidelines as passive spectators
5301591 intentional constant and systematic attempts are being made to erode the achievements of the kemalist ataturk revolution turning religion into an ideology will politicise it and religion will then be the biggest loser

5301633 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5301634 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5301635 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5301636 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5301637 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5301638 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5301639 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5301640 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5301641 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5301642 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5301643 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5301644 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5301645 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5301646 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5301647 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5301648 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5301649 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5301650 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
5301651 we now want to look at small versus large operations and organic versus nonorganic operations to see if there are differences

5301656 it would have been nice to win that one the 200m but she american rebecca soni just came home that strong in the last 25m

5301684 there is no substantive evidence to suggest that those initiatives or facilities which exist including st thomass community network would be seriously undermined or harmfully compromised

5301690 we recognise the orders and jurisdiction those anglicans who uphold orthodox faith abnd practice so bishop schofield et al will recognise as orthodox faith and practice churches which uphold womens ordination and have a woman presiding at the eucharist and heading a congregation
5301691 the anglican communion will be split tomorrow when conservatives representing more than half its total membership will announce the formation of a new orthodox body to be a stronghold against liberal views it will be schism in all but name
5301692 persistent prayer over many years has opened the way for a huge number of effective initiatives delivering benefits to people and communities far and wide
5301693 there are significant benefits from initiatives which involve faith communities working with the police and local agencies including improving community confidence and trust increased understanding and not least reduced crime
5301694 by working and praying together to reduce crime and disorder we not only change the physical circumstances that affect peoples everyday lives but we change the spiritual circumstances

5301707 the european court of human rights has issued several reminders of its commitment to the confidentiality of sources by condemning states that do not comply with this principle
5301708 it is legitimate to combat terrorism but not at the expense of the equally legitimate right to the protection of sources the cornerstone of a free and independent press
5301709 this latest case highlights the growing need for more precision in the restrictions placed on the protection of the confidentiality of sources both in european union member states and in other countries we would like these restrictions to be better defined and more protective for journalists and their sources as they are in belgian law
5301710 this confidentiality can be violated only at the request of a judge and only if the revelations of the sources in question are the only means to prevent the commission of crimes threatening the physical safety of one or more persons and only if furthermore this information is of crucial importance in preventing the commission of these crimes and no other means exists to obtain it
5301711 so there grows up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause and at no time does it cease or disappear for it gives place neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship and the case is the same even though those who differ with respect to these colors be brothers or any other kin
5301712 the support of a faction became necessary to every candidate for civil or ecclesiastical honors

5301729 a post to help you stay positive even during the storm
5301730 most people believe that the doing or action part is what makes things happen however this belief causes you to create in reverse

5301738 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5301739 the honor and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honor of the office of president will also be affected
5301740 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism
5301741 he has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5301742 india will continue to have an amicable relation with pakistan in the days to come

5301752 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5301753 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5301754 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5301755 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5301756 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5301757 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5301758 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5301759 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5301760 will he think im ugly will he know im gay what if i dont say the right things
5301761 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5301762 deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too
5301763 like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
5301764 the removal of musharraf would result in the military playing a more autonomous role on issues of relations with india including policies on kashmir support for the taleban and control over nuclear weapons
5301765 we have never interfered in pakistans internal matters pakistan should do the same
5301766 is it prime minister geelani nawaz sharif asif ali zardari or army chief general kayani
5301767 he didnt have to worry about how his answer would be perceived he didnt have to work to recall his talking points he didnt have to think or even try to look like he was thinking all he had to do was blurt out what he believed clearly this gave him an unfair advantage and we think the american people will see this for what it is another republican smear tactic
5301768 yeah mccain has to just say what he believes while we have to lie through our teeth i mean cmon what kind of moron believes all that bible crap anyway
5301769 it is with great sorrow that we must announce this brave soldiers death as we offer our sympathies to this soldiers loved ones

5301800 na escolha da empresa do ano a rentabilidade tem mais peso que o crescimento
5301801 against the background of global economic downturn volume growth in sea freight has diminished
5301802 this applies especially to exports from asia which are dominating the global sea freight market
5301803 the religion of islam has come to wipe out all kinds of terrorism and to spread the message of global peace
5301804 islam rejects all kinds of unjust violence breach of peace bloodshed murder and plunder and does not allow it in any form
5301805 islam has taught its followers to treat all mankind with equality mercy tolerance justice all kinds of violence and terrorism in the strongest possible terms
5301806 islamic faith by linking terrorism with islam and distorting the meanings of quranic verses and prophet traditions
5301807 this i think is one sign that the peoples republic of china is changing i think at least decade by decade
5301808 hopefully now this will lead to a more transparent attitude in other fields including the tibet case
5301809 tibetan buddhist culture can be a great contribution to enrich the cultural heritage of peoples republic of china
5301810 on the question of autonomy we are committed to the middle way
5301811 defence and foreign affairs should be governed by the central government but the rest of the business education environment religious work all these should be handled by tibetans themselves
5301812 not only outside but even inside there are people who really are very critical about our approach but so far ok i think we can manage with these people
5301813 i couldnt believe this was happening in britain the bishop of rochester was criticised by the church of england recently when he said there were no go areas in britain but he was right there are certainly no go areas for christians who want to share the gospel
5301814 i told him that this had nothing to do with the gospel we were preaching but he became very aggressive
5301815 he said we were in a muslim area and were not allowed to spread our christian message he said we were committing a hate crime by telling the youths to leave islam and said that he was going to take us to the police station
5301816 you have been warned if you come back here and get beaten up well you have been warned
5301817 they told people i died in an accident rather than having the shame of their son leaving islam
5301818 the options have become clear either rivalry of the religions clash of civilizations war of the nations or dialogue of civilizations and peace between the nations as a presupposition for peace between the nations
5301819 in the face of the deadly threat to all humankind instead of building new dams of hatred revenge and enmity we should tear down the walls of prejudice stone by stone and thus build bridges of dialogue bridges particularly towards islam
5301820 it remains an open question if the ecumenical paradigm of post modernity will develop also in islam
5301821 jesus christ as a basic model is a constant but the law of celibacy is a variable
5301822 after the reformation christianity had to undergo another paradigm shift that of the enlightenment judaism after the french revolution and napoleon experienced the enlightenment first and as a consequence at least in reform judaism it experienced also a religious reformation islam however has not undergone a serious religious reformation and so to the present day has quite special problems also with modernity and its core components freedom of conscience and religion human rights tolerance democracy
5301823 they do not recognize themselves in our picture of islam because they want to be loyal citizens of the islamic religion
5301824 those who make islam responsible for kidnappings suicide attacks car bombs and beheadings carried out by a few blind extremists ought at the same time to condemn christianity or judaism for the barbarous maltreatment of prisoners the air strikes and tank attacks carried out by the us army several 10 000 civilians have been murdered in iraq alone and the terrorism of the israeli army of occupation in palestine
5301825 he also sets out what the three religions have in common such as injunctions against murder respect for life
5301826 whether islam is even capable of adapting to a post modern world in the way that christianity and judaism have done
5301827 to bring us back when we wander too far from the path of national destiny
5301828 you can explain what a special or sacred place is but to experience it is the only way to really understand it
5301829 you have to be there for it to be transformative pilgrimages tend to be in groups and so it is good to go in a group
5301830 when you stand on the top of the tor it feels like nothing else it must have been truly wonderful and bizarre when it was an island standing out of the marshes people have constructed mythologies and stories around it some manipulated for example by the monks who just happened to find the graves of king arthur and guinevere in their abbey prompting the pilgrimages and the money that comes with them even today the towns economy is largely driven by spiritual visitors
5301831 the point is for them to experience the story but not say if it is true
5301832 that is not what is important in re i cannot say the christian stories are authentic and the new age worshippers and pagans are weirdos especially as in the uk traditional religious groups are on the decline and people doing their own spiritual thing are on the increase
5301833 re is a very important part of discourse and its increasing relevance has been partly driven by events such as 9 11
5301834 one of the things the kids in my classes learn is that there is not necessarily a right or wrong answer re is a subversive subject you are encouraging people to think for themselves encouraging them to think what is right and what is wrong people on one level want children to do that but on another they dont really i get paid to blow peoples minds and i get mine blown away too when i walk into an re lesson i have no idea where it will go we have the most fabulous discussions
5301835 i thought it would be like dartmoor a bit boring but it was different and really atmospheric
5301836 i sat on the tor in silence and i could let my imagination run wild you really listen to mr jamisons lessons he is very free and you can believe what you want i am not sure of my religion yet
5301837 i think what you got out of the trip depends on the basis of your religion and i have not made my mind up yet i have only been around for 13 years and have not seen all that much the water from the well does taste like blood and it depends on whether you believe the legend about the holy grail but if you do not it could be because of the iron ore in the stone
5301838 glastonbury felt like a very special place on top of the tor you felt you could see all over the world i think joseph of arimathea could have come here
5301839 you cannot get on with people you do not understand but the issue is muddied by faith schools they may look at different religions but they say this one is right
5301840 a recent survey found that 53 of re teachers have not studied the subject post a level
5301841 significant numbers appear to hold beliefs which contravene democratic values
5301842 these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said there is no extremism in british universities
5301843 there is a wide cultural divide between muslim and nonmuslim students the solution is to stop talking about celebrating diversity and focus on integration and assimilation
5301844 our researchers found a ghettoised mentality among muslim students at queen mary also we found the segregation between muslim men and women at events more visible at queen mary
5301845 clearly we in no way associate ourselves with these views however also integral to the spirit of university life is free speech and debate and on occasion speakers will make statements that are deemed offensive
5301846 this disgusting report is a reflection of the biases and prejudices of a right wing think tank not the views of muslim students across britain
5301847 only 632 muslim students were asked vague and misleading questions and their answers were wilfully misinterpreted
5301848 a third of british muslim students believe killing in the name of islam can be justified
5301849 a third of 632 british muslim students surveyed believe killing in the name of islam can be justified
5301850 tamimi a british based supporter of hamas described israel as the most inhumane project in the modern history of humanity
5301851 the president comes from a very religious background these people dont see women as equal human beings this is why they fight for the headscarf they just want to hide women from the eyes of man it will be followed by segregation this means male doctors never examining female patients and vice versa
5301852 sometimes on hot days in the sun it is uncomfortable to wear the headscarf i dont think it is something you can force upon women
5301853 but turkey is a different society families are all mixed together some members wear the headscarf others dont we are used to their different choices
5301854 do you think gucci would advertise if i did that
5301855 but they didnt listen they gave it to him anyway so whats the point
5301856 i dont care i hope the court kicks him out
5301857 my magazine sells only tens of thousands of copies my reader is not a typical turkish woman we are like a small european country in the middle of turkey
5301858 it is a joke i can only be myself in five or six districts of this city and on the aegean or south coasts the harassment of women who dont cover up is increasing i get called a whore as i walk down the street the confidence of the islamic movement is shoring up lumpen sexism among turkish men
5301859 they are like i am sexy but you cant f me until you marry me
5301860 it is not the will of god to make all people muslim
5301861 a woman can wear a scarf only if she wants to wear it she must not be forced it is a torture but it is equally wrong to prohibit as to enforce it
5301862 it was a matter of identity if you want to be a muslim you have to keep it in your identity it is a social and an individual thing
5301863 they dont want to be represented to international firms by women like me
5301864 all the women in headscarves who are my age are aware of the world
5301865 when i visit these rural places i can always spot the woman in charge
5301866 i am sick of it being waved by the akp as a flag of democracy this islamic movement is like squeezed toothpaste you cannot force it back in
5301867 we need to be more lenient on headscarves and more critical of the process at work if we are democratic around 60 to 70 per cent are covered anyway we have come to the point where those who are going to cover are already covered up and 25 per cent are totally opposed and will never wear it
5301868 women who wear headscarves have already been exposed to religious ideology it affects the kind of things they want in life they make more passive choices being a wife and mother is encouraged and there is nothing wrong with that but equal choices are not given they are not given any real substantial options
5301869 women have to be more careful since they have stimulants
5301870 they should not show their ornaments and figure and they should cover in a fine manner
5301871 the headscarf war in turkey is so grave and bitterly entrenched that it has brought angry millions onto the streets
5301872 state and were the state theyre ignorant so well decide what they wear
5301873 now that the economy is better women can stay home and not work anymore
5301874 i reckon this might be the toughest qualifier for the world cup
5301875 we are going into the unknown to play a team we know very little about in an environment we are not used to
5301876 we simply do not know what we are coming up against and its going to be a great experience and challenge
5301877 they have had a good qualifying campaign so far and it is going to be hard so we have to make sure that we are prepared as best as we possibly can be
5301878 this match certainly has got me thinking we will have to adapt in the first five minutes to whatever they will throw at us
5301879 we might need to win a few away games because of the demand of having to fly back to australia in a short period of time to play the home games which does not necessarily mean that we are going to be 100 per cent fit and rested
5301880 if we could steal some wins on the road it would give us a bit of insurance for when we come to play at home
5301881 we have to be cautious when we are away and if we are not losing games it means we are picking up points
5301882 i can see where pim is coming from but id like us to pinch a few away wins as well
5301883 its a good pressure to have it means we have set high standards
5301884 because we did well at the world cup the public now expects us to beat japan every time and beat uzbekistan easily but the players are under no illusion that that is the way its going to be
5301885 in a way we are the victims of our mini success in germany
5301886 we know the games are going to be tough now and for this reason we are not going to leave anything to chance
5301887 we seem to play our best football when nobody gives us a chance of winning
5301888 we all come from different leagues and we seem to throw that in the mix and come up with a good national team
5301889 we are also very versatile and adaptable we can play thee or four at the back depending on the opposition for example
5301890 la apertura de consultas sobre el art culo 96 del acuerdo de cotonou
5301891 they said they were doing a similar effort as last year they would reduce the water by 15 percent from 2004 and that was the basis of what happened last year

5301894 sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire che rinunciare a te
5301895 more waiting this time pacing i thought i might as well make myself a moving target for the picture snappers
5301896 dont get me wrong at the height of play my skills on court didnt hold a candle to any of the players on this reincarnation of the dream team but as an individual as a person in my own right i held my own then and i feel that i more than play my part now but as i watched one player turn to face his team mates then a bus length of curtains twitch i was glad that i could only lip read some of the comments the body language alone was unpleasant who knew derision amusement and contempt would meld so formidably and translate so clearly through glass and smog
5301897 i am a man of principle the year before that offer was made by the lakers nobody was interested in me
5301898 there are many people who are asked what their word is worth when people ask me that i can say well at least 17 million dollars
5301899 we are very happy to announce that after an afternoon faculty review meeting of all available data we found out that none of the deaths can be attributed to drugs
5301900 there seems to be complete market failure as our subscribers are denied advanced value added services in contrast to world scenario where such internet based services are very popular
5301901 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5301902 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5301903 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5301904 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5301905 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5301906 a resposta fisiol gica psicol gica e comportamental de um indiv duo que procura adaptar se e ajustar se s press es externas e internas
5301907 fifty years have passed and dozens of armed groups have spurted across north east india and jammu and kashmir the afspa has manifestly failed to contain any insurgency instead it has become the symbol of oppression and repression
5301908 the afspa cannot address conflicts arising out of controversies such as the one relating to the amarnath shrine in jammu and kashmir but the actions of the armed forces and impunity enjoyed by them under the afspa can certainly alienate the people further
5301909 fire upon or otherwise use force even to the causing of death
5301910 it is the opportunity to disseminate the principles of islam islam advocates dialogue among people especially calling them to the path of allah
5301911 invite all to the way of the lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in the ways that are best and most gracious
5301912 without islam the world is nothing we control 20 of the worlds resources we dont want to waste these and it is our duty not to hand over what we have muslims are authorised to defend themselves in a good manner
5301913 iraqis have a responsibility not to let the americans impose their diplomatic mission on islam iraq has a great heritage and america wants to exploit it we should not allow this exploitation and subjugation to continue it is unofficial colonisation
5301914 hes like someone typing on a computer keyboard but hes always several spaces to the left or to the right
5301915 what he surely meant to say is that the decline of christianity which has been going on since the 18th century is perceived by some as being exacerbated by a community that has a strong identity and set of values he is transferring his angst and insecurity remembering what it used to be like when christianity had these things he articulates a view held by people in the pews but whether its held by the bench of bishops is another matter
5301916 he has issues and i wish he would stop telling me how to interpret my religion maybe its a subconscious thing but he needs to get over it
5301917 if you want to go high in the church of england you keep your nose clean and you become a safe pair of hands thats what most of them are but nazir ali is a prophet and prophets are rejected in their own constituency like jesus was he is a serious man for serious times what you see in public is what you get in private
5301918 hes a major influence among anglo catholics evangelicals and its well known that rowan williams and the bishop have not spoken in any detail for more than a year if rowan had consulted michael about sharia law it would have saved the church of england a lot of heartache
5301919 we may not like him but he is formidable whether he knows it or not questions about islam are a great way to marginalise liberals and will become the new battleground for the evangelical wing of the church of england
5301920 with matters of public reassurance and the reduction of crime and disorder in all communities in the west midlands
5301921 now accept that there was no evidence that the broadcaster or programme makers have misled the audience or that the programme was likely to encourage or incite criminal activity
5301922 the abhorrent and extreme comments made by the fundamentalist preachers in this film speak for themselves they later claimed they had been taken out of context but no one has explained the correct context for arguing women are born deficient that homosexuals should be thrown off mountains and that 10 year old girls should be hit if they refuse to wear the hijab
5301923 why are you still clinging to this feudal relic this tired dream of holy authority
5301924 why cant you see that the gospel spurns hierarchy and calls us to freedom
5301925 contrary to the first assertion the episcopal church is growing
5301926 perpetuating the impression that this religion is wedded to illiberalism
5301927 dwindling congregations with more holy bureaucrats to manage the decline
5301928 despite jesus words in johns gospel christianity has been promoted at the point of the sword and legally supported by extreme sanctions despite the quranic axiom islam has been supported in the same way with extreme penalties for abandoning it and civil disabilities for those outside the faith
5301929 there is no religious tradition whose history is exempt from such temptation and such failure
5301930 what we need as a vision for our dialogue is to break the current cycles of violence to show the world that faith and faith alone can truly ground a commitment to peace which definitively abandons the tempting but lethal cycle of retaliation in which we simply imitate each others violence
5301931 your letter could hardly be more timely given the growing awareness that peace throughout the world is deeply entwined with the ability of all people of faith everywhere to live in peace justice mutual respect and love
5301932 this is how i want to spend the rest of my life
5301933 you dont put a hotline up to god and get the answers
5301934 the worst thing in politics is when youre so scared of losing support that you dont do what you think is the right thing what faith can do is not tell you what is right but give you the strength to do it
5301935 i think faith gives you a certain strength and gives you a support in doing a job as difficult as leading a country
5301936 europe is more exceptional than sometimes it likes to think of itself
5301937 prof zaghloul al naggar professor of geology and director of the london based markfield institute of higher education has rightly told islamonline that many westerners some of them homosexual convert to islam in order to appeal to islamic communities and spread sinful behaviour among muslims thus shaking their belief
5301938 and i havent seen them demonstrate in front of the radical mosques where are they
5301939 its ok to be pro israel but not to be unbelievably pro likud israel its ok to be pro american but not look as if youre taking instructions from washington
5301940 to kill or be killed for the sake of allah
5301941 poses a serious risk to the future of investigative journalism
5301942 im not asking for immunity or favours i just want to be able to get on with my life and undo the work that i did
5301943 ive fundraised for terrorism ive trained in a training camp and ive sent other people to train i am willing to plead guilty im not looking to get locked up but if i have to i have to
5301944 its rather like trying to take people off drugs by the very nature of your work you have to associate with people who take drugs so there are going to be drugs around
5301945 hassan is associating with radicals thats what hes intending to do and thats the community that hes in hes trying to unwind it but to do so he still needs to be in those places
5301946 its just a matter of time before operations are taken out in britain when it does happen people will bite their bottom lips
5301947 i dont have any doubts at all hes said a lot of things to me that are extremely courageous what hes coming out with is incredibly powerful
5301948 journalists are in sufficient peril already without greater manchester police adding to the difficulties and dangers of covering the war on terror
5301949 tony mcnulty a home office minister has praised my work invited me in and said it has shaped the way theyre thinking about terrorism so one arm of the state is saying well done and congratulations while another is trying to take away all my work and make it impossible for me to do my job its a crazy situation
5301950 i would rather be a traitor to britain than to my religion
5301951 i have direct responsibility for the british recruits it is my job to get them into the training camps here where they prepare for war
5301952 if they do return i believe they will take military action within britain
5301953 this is all about jihad in manchester my message to all muslims is that they should be supporting jihad no matter how hard it is becoming all the laws the british government make they should break
5301954 i feel absolutely nothing for this country i have no problem with the british people but if someone attacks them i have no problem with that either
5301955 what ive come to realise is that killing for the sake of killing and killing in the name of islam for the sake of killing is completely and utterly prohibited
5301956 some believed the bombings were orchestrated by the government others believed it was near impossible for four british born muslims to be behind such indiscriminate violence two years on i still hear the same conspiracy theories being clung to by a muslim community that is living in a comforting state of denial
5301957 there is a serious hindrance of free speech taking place on this
5301958 the judge recognised that the bbc and other media bodies could properly raise concerns about proposed party election broadcasts
5301959 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
5301960 perhaps dr williams should ask his flock how many support his liberal stance i suspect if it was an election he would not be re elected
5301961 a more brilliant intellectual it would be difficult to find
5301962 thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts as of woollen and linen together
5301963 marriage is an holy estate devised by god for the procreation of children
5301964 the problem is that anyone who takes a stand for bible views is denounced as intolerant
5301965 rowan atkinson should resign immediately it is obvious now that he is the cause of the schism in the church
5301966 they said go away youre not our son they told people i died in an accident rather than having the shame of their son leaving islam
5301967 they kept saying the punishment is death do you know the punishment is death
5301968 i got up to get baptised thats when my mother got up ran to the front and tried to pull me out of the water
5301969 believe it is ok to kill any man who was born into islam and left the faith
5301970 i believe the classical law of apostasy in islam is wrong and based on a misunderstanding of the original sources because the quran and hadith dont actually talk about a death penalty for apostasy
5301971 be kind to those who are on earth and he in the heavens will be kind to you
5301972 c losing post offices he is the minister for the shambles at heathrow he is the former fire fighter who betrayed his former workmates by opposing the great battle of the fire brigades union indeed i think quite a lot of fire fighters will be with me in this fight he is hated there as a man who betrayed them
5301973 he voted very strongly against a transparent parliament he voted moderately for introducing a smoking ban he voted very strongly for introducing id cards he voted very strongly for introducing foundation hospitals he voted very strongly for introducing student top up fees he voted very strongly for labour anti terrorist laws he voted very strongly for the iraq war he voted very strongly against investigating the iraq war he voted very strongly for replacing trident he voted very strongly for the fox hunting ban and he voted very strongly for equal gay rights and all of these are the reasons why it is going to be the mother of all battles in poplar and limehouse
5301974 a programme that has had some or all of its costs met by a sponsor with a view to promoting its own or anothers name trademark image activities services products or any other direct or indirect interest
5301975 it takes two witnesses of a woman to equal the one witness of the man
5301976 by the age of ten it becomes an obligation on us to force her young girls to wear hijab and if she doesnt wear hijab we hit her
5301977 whoever changes his religion from al islam to anything else kill him in the islamic state
5301978 concerned with matters of public reassurance and the reduction of crime and disorder in all communities in the west midlands area
5301979 likely to undermine feelings of public reassurance and safety of those communities in the west midlands for which the chief constable has a responsibility
5301980 he has a radical plan for this country muslims shouldnt accept british democracy
5301981 king queen house of commons if you accept it then you are part of it you dont accept it but you have to dismantle it so you being a muslim you have to fix a target there will be no house of commons from that white house to this black house we know that we have to dismantle it
5301982 dr mian is inciting muslims to target the public institutions of the uk and the west and directly dismantle them
5301983 i would like to replace all these with masjid masjid masjids
5301984 there will be a house of commons but they will decide every issue in accordance with the book of allah and the example of the prophet
5301985 it has come to pass that the nassara the yahud france germany they have come against the religion of islam why give up your religion and your long legacy of islam to please someone who is the enemy to you
5301986 never will the jews or the christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion
5301987 verily allah going to bring a group of people that he loves and they love him these people will be soft and kind to the believers but they will be rough and tough against the kuffaar they will fight in the cause of allah i encourage all of you to be amongst them to begin to cultivate ourselves for the time that is fastly approaching where the tables are going to turn and the muslims are going to be in a position of being uppermost in strength and when that happens people wont get killed unjustly
5301988 oh ye who believe if any from among you turn back from his faith soon will allah produce a people whom he will love as they will love him lowly would the believers mighty against the rejecters fighting in the way of allah and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault
5301989 there was an individual who was killed in afghanistan recently it was a muslim name he came from a pakistani family and do you know what theyve written in the tabloid newspaper hero of islam hero of islam who went into a muslim afghanistan to kill muslims why because their crime is implementing islam
5301990 the hero of islam is the one who separated his head from his shoulders
5301991 they are liars they are terrorists themselves liars they will come before the people and talk and they are lying you cant believe them hes a pathological liar
5301992 he abu usamah delivers comments that could constitute inciting religious hatred
5301993 the programme potentially provided the viewer with preconceived ideas as to what the speaker was trying to convey
5301994 to demonstrate as it powerfully did that extreme views were being preached in some mainstream mosques and islamic organisations
5301995 tomorrow they will build a bullet proof sic or do something different
5301996 it has come to pass that the nassara and the yahud america the uk france germany they have come against the religion of islam why give up your religion and your long legacy of islam to please someone who is the enemy to you
5301997 and never will jews and the christians approve of you until you follow their religion
5301998 competitions should be conducted fairly prizes should be described accurately and rules should be clear and appropriately made known
5301999 any use of premium rate numbers must comply with the code of practice issued by the independent committee for the supervision of standards of telephone information services icstis

5302001 there is a constant and natural tension in the creation of satire
5302002 the delicate art of satire is suffocated by heavy handed elucidation but if the satirist fails to make the point clearly enough the whole enterprise backfires in unintended misinterpretation
5302003 what i think it does is hold up a mirror to the prejudice and dark imaginings about barack obamas both obamas past and their politics the idea that we would publish a cover saying these things literally i think is just not in the vocabulary of what we do and who we are weve run many many satirical political covers ask the bush administration how many
5302004 there is not much the members of the liberal blogosphere and i agree on but i salute them on their efforts to stamp out humor and especially satire and bring more earnestness to our political discourse
5302005 now i was 20 21 years old and i hadnt been exposed to a lot the year before i played in raleigh and we lived in a segregated area the bus would drop us off at a familys house and take the white players to a hotel but now were in the big leagues so to speak and atlanta is coming to town the next year and they have to integrate the hotels
5302006 elio chacon went across the street to eat and they wouldnt feed him because of segregation
5302007 we sat there until they called the police but they said that civil rights had passed and they had to feed us about that time i made up my mind that i didnt want to eat that i was just going to sit there and see what took place finally they said they would feed us and they brought out food but i wouldnt eat
5302008 i dont know what hc would bring to the veep
5302009 or is it a big tent party devoted broadly to economic and social fairness the greatest good for the greatest number the notion of government as a force for good with room in the tent for a variety of approaches to those goals
5302010 sometimes i get the feeling reading comments from clintonites that what they want the dem party to become is a mirror of the gop of the last 30 years
5302011 sometimes i get the feeling reading comments from clintonites that what they want the dem party to become is a mirror of the gop of the last 30 years if obama is delivering the party from that impulse i like him even more
5302012 after the glow came off the rose it took a hell of a long time for him to
5302013 i think the two main dangers to obama are racism and embittered clinton supporters voting directly against their own best interests
5302014 as to the second well it was a long hard primary but smart voters will realize that the small policy differences between obama and clinton are dwarfed by the vast gulf between obama and mccain
5302015 but statements like these are characteristic of a mindset that views obama as the perfect candidate and the only reasons people could possibly have for voting against him or having reservations about him is that they are a sore losers and or b racists
5302016 george mcgovern followed the caucus strategy quite successfully in 1972 in the general election the party poohbahs and regular democratic voters sat on their hands and let him go down to make a point
5302017 however as an anecdote most of the reasons for not supporting obama ive heard from clinton backers really arent rational theyll say hes not very experienced hes roughly as experienced as hillary clinton or that hes not tough enough he was tough enough to defeat the most famous woman in the world but what else is there in all honesty id love to hear some kind of rational reasoning
5302018 they did and it got us a second nixon term in which the sitting president was so corrupt that he had to resign lest he face impeachment
5302019 you are missing my point the democrats who did not support mcgovern made their point that the party would suffer if it ran roughshod over them and ignored their interests
5302020 obama has to win over white working class voters if he wants to win the election
5302021 he has to win over a substantial percentage of white working class voters
5302022 my early release if im in the slammer for doing drugs im on his ipod man
5302023 how on earth did they ever get this rat from the chicago political sewers to this level of resume vetting anyway his anorexic resume wouldnt have made it as far as the mailroom in any other self respecting party
5302024 theyre doing well its no different than what it was last week they are executing the offense sometimes theyll make mistakes but for the most part they are doing what we are asking them to do
5302025 this is a different team from last year we feel like we have depth and that is the one thing going back last year i had high expectations but i didnt realize we didnt have the depth we had to go out and recruit guys from winning programs that can help us out and win

5302041 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
5302042 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
5302043 we see in kazakhstan perspectives in not just processing of raw material but also want to participate in development of infrastructure of the projects we want to be as investors and partners
5302044 last week i listed out 9 reasons why brands are unsuccessful in twitter and other microblogging technologies companies are caught between the minutia of the discussions and their willingness to be human or add value to the conversations although a one sided view of whats going wrong now lets focus on whats going right
5302045 process that makes a website accessible functional and culturally suited to a specific market
5302046 the internet is now being used as a medium for everything from accommodation bookings to research on zymology
5302047 new uses are added daily and it makes sense for companies to have website visibility and function at the heart of their international marketing strategy

5302064 all of life is but vanity and grasping for the wind
5302065 yes people are obsessed by islam for example im going to india next month and i want to give this message that all religions are equal sometimes there are priorities because of particular situations but we mustnt get the impression there are first class religions and second class religions
5302066 a kind of road map for priests bishops and ordinary brothers and sisters of course these have to be adapted to local situations as someone in morocco is not in the same situation as someone in japan
5302067 have many things in common with other believers for example that we all believe in one god that we profess the same sacredness of life the necessity of fraternity the experience of prayer
5302068 the formation of youth because we realise that in the society in which we live in multi ethnical multi cultural societies the young generation are perhaps lost so we have to give them points of reference and religions are obviously very important in that
5302069 what is good for me is good for the other so if its possible for muslims to have a mosque in the west we should have the same in muslim countries this is not the case in many countries
5302070 it is a very impressive building now were going to have a school there run by nuns so this is an example of very good inter religious dialogue with very concrete effects in saudi arabia that is not the case yet
5302071 we dont have precise information about what the king has in mind but i suppose it will be a gradual evolution for example the possibility to celebrate services in hotels in embassies
5302072 i am ready to help it but its a very demanding task i suppose he has the charisma and the will but it is very demanding if we can help him we would do so very willingly because he has a clear leadership and much good will
5302073 the truth has to impose itself by itself not by the sword
5302074 religion x is a load of unsubstantiated rubbish that gets special treatment but religion y is all true but suffers from persecution
5302075 yes its a good idea to have a church in saudi arabia can some one tell me how many mosque are there in vatican city jami manchester uk
5302076 being muslim affords you no special treatment here we respect freedom of speech you should be grateful that you live in a country that treats muslims quite differently from the way muslim countries treat non muslims
5302077 about ten years ago i was in an enviable position i was making 12 million a movie i was at the top of my career i stepped away from all that to spend time with my children now i make 125 000 for a movie but do i have less
5302078 but there is no accounting for spending that time with my children
5302079 i heard it was their intent but i hadnt realised that they had infiltrated british schools i believe they work using mind manipulation
5302080 in light of the issues which have been brought to our attention relating to the kabbalah centre in the uk we wish it to be known that this organisation does not fall within the remit of the chief rabbinate or any other authority in the uk recognised by us
5302081 that it is not supported by any main religious group in the world what does that tell you
5302082 id like to tell madonna i wont meddle in your songs if you stop meddling in my judaic traditions
5302083 i dont even think about that i just do my thing
5302084 ok guys the spiritual detective searches for clues within himself
5302085 i felt angry because my sister woke me and i yelled at her
5302086 i scratched his face threw him on the ground and hit him
5302087 im an sfk facilitator in a years time i want to be an sfk teacher
5302088 you cant be faithful to this woman you cant support this woman she has three kids but then another voice said follow that woman
5302089 i followed her here i would follow her to the end of the world
5302090 i want to be clear sfk is not kabbalah its for every child in the world to have the tools for life
5302091 its not a religion its a science its the science of connection
5302092 its incredible that we have to defend sfk and talk about kabbalah when all we are trying to do is teach children that they have innate goodness and help them to figure out the rules of life
5302093 anything to do with the word spirituality has connotations for people
5302094 we turned them down it didnt feel right i dont believe in doing it their way
5302095 it takes a long time for these children to trust you you have to prove that you are a constant in their lives
5302096 schools have removed religious education to be more inclusive but theyve lost something important morality and community the government is trying to balance that with personal and social development and citizenship but its so poorly organised its not meeting anyones needs
5302097 sfk approached me and since we started the programme it has had a significant effect on some of our childrens lives a lot of them have behavioural problems and sfk has helped them to become more active in making decisions
5302098 sfk didnt talk about kabbalah when they came to see me originally but a few of our parents spotted the connection and came to talk to us about it they were worried about terms such as the light and thought it sounded a bit like a cult two parents took their children out of the class
5302099 im not sure about all this business of the light all i know is that this has helped these children its about common decency and teaching them how to behave frankly its better than nothing
5302100 id question the integrity of any school that hasnt properly researched the work of the kabbalah centre
5302101 it might make the children feel good but so would drugs and alcohol it is not necessarily good for them the schools and the government are going to have a lot to answer for when the implications of sfk is understood
5302102 sfk is the kabbalah centres childrens charity and it shares the same co founder karen berg who has dedicated her life to bring spirituality to the world many of the volunteers and donors of sfk come from the kabbalah centre one of the major principles of kabbalah is to share and give back as seen with donna karan who is a student of the kabbalah centre and who also gives back through her work with sfk
5302103 it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven
5302104 give me your children till theyre seven and you can have them for the rest of your life
5302105 anyone who claims this has refuted islam and should be tried so that he can take it back if not he should be killed as an apostate from the religion of islam
5302106 it is disgraceful that articles containing this kind of apostasy should be published in the land of the two holy shrines in mecca and medina
5302107 unfortunately you can even justify through alleged hadiths the muslim or pseudo muslim practice of female genital mutilation
5302108 you can find messages which say that is what the prophet ordered us to do but you can show historically how they came into being as influences from other cultures that were then projected onto islamic tradition
5302109 there are some messages that ban women from travelling for three days or more without their husbands permission and they are genuine
5302110 but this isnt a religious ban it came about because in the prophets time it simply wasnt safe for a woman to travel alone like that but as time has passed people have made permanent what was only supposed to be a temporary ban for safety reasons
5302111 he longed for the day when a woman might travel long distances alone
5302112 we hear that some women are being killed when they marry the wrong person or run away with someone they love
5302113 theres also violence against women within families including sexual harassment by uncles and others this does not exist in islam we have to explain that to them
5302114 not exactly the same but if you think its changing the theological foundations of the religion
5302115 you cant say for example that the verses of violence override the verses of peace this is used a lot in the middle east this kind of ideology
5302116 the challenge to islamism can only legitimately come from within the islamic community if it is to have any impact
5302117 im not in denial about anything im not asking for immunity or favours i just want to be able to get on with my life and undo the work that i did
5302118 ive fundraised for terrorism ive trained in a training camp and ive sent other people to train i am willing to plead guilty im not looking to get locked up but if i have to i have to
5302119 i also began to discover deeper theological flaws in the jihadi world view
5302120 these doubts drove me to begin a battle of ideas with my former associates slowly i began to recruit over a dozen young british muslims who used to be hardened radicals out of the network
5302121 i told him mcnulty everything about my radical past i told him i understand the radical mindset perfectly at the end of it we were offered money i said no to the money ive made this problem myself i can deal with it myself i just want you guys to support me
5302122 designed to determine among other things whether butts renunciation of terrorism is in fact genuine
5302123 why all this cat and mouse stuff im not trying to run
5302124 people dont want to see me obviously they know i am under surveillance
5302125 for the first time in western muslim history a muslim group is challenging extremists using a scriptural and theological paradigm there has not been a categorical refutation of islamism by any muslim groups we are the first to do it
5302126 if you have done nothing wrong you have nothing to fear
5302127 there has not been a categorical refutation of islamism by any muslim groups we are the first to do it
5302128 the challenge to islamism can only legitimately come from within the islamic community if it is to have any impact
5302129 you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
5302130 they are not told dont go and fall in love
5302131 she loved to speak about his blond hair his honey eyes his white skin and the sweet way he had of speaking he was very different from the local men who usually are tough and illiterate
5302132 i was in heaven when she was speaking about him everything looked so beautiful
5302133 with just a simple caring smile he was able to give her the sense of love making her forget all life in iraq but i always had to remind rand that she was a muslim and her family was never going to accept her marrying a christian british soldier
5302134 unfortunately she never wanted to hear me her mind was very far from reality closer to an impossible dream
5302135 but the thing she used to like talking about best was how he praised her beauty and her intelligence she told me he called her princess
5302136 she was proud to be a virgin and had a dream to give herself to the man she loved only after her marriage
5302137 i screamed and called out for her two brothers so they could get their father away but when he told them the reason instead of saving her they helped him end her life
5302138 the father has very good contacts in the basra government
5302139 i was beaten and had my arm broken by him
5302140 no man can accept being left by a woman in iraq
5302141 rand was just a young girl with romantic dreams she always kept her religion close to her heart she would never even hurt a petal on a rose
5302142 man is tribal by nature it is an inbuilt instinct as unanswerable to reason or debate as hunger
5302143 the poorest for whom life is already a real struggle will bear the brunt of climate change while those that have consumed more than their fair share of the earth will not have to pay such a heavy price we have to remember that the earth was given to us by god to feed us all in return we must love and care for it that is why as a religious community we feel it is our obligation to lobby our mps on this important issue
5302144 tackling climate change is essential if the governments good work in fighting poverty is not to be undermined by rising global temperatures which hit the worlds poor hardest we desperately need to see a strong bill going through parliament which shows the uk is taking tough action on climate change and gives the government a mandate to speak out at crucial international talks
5302145 message from the global christian forum to brothers and sisters in christ throughout the world
5302146 we are extremely pleased by the development and outcome of this meeting
5302147 what one decade ago was born within the wcc as an idea that seemed fragile and almost impossible to achieve has led to a milestone in the ecumenical journey
5302148 to move out of the familiar ground and to meet each other on a common ground where mutual trust might flourish
5302149 might be empowered to celebrate enter into dialogue and act together
5302150 develop a new awareness and understanding of one another and to recognize that god is graciously working among us
5302151 differing views on substantive issues such as ecclesiology the understanding of the church the scope of evangelism and mission
5302152 watershed in modern christian history gods holy spirit has begun erasing the excuses that have kept christians apart from one another and judging one another
5302153 on the basis of many ecumenical inter confessional and other historic initiatives to overcome divisions in the christian family we do not seek to replace these efforts
5302154 any resulting joint actions will be outworked through the participating churches and organizations
5302155 particular attention to under represented groups including women youth indigenous peoples and the physically challenged
5302156 regional national and local levels as well as at the global level
5302157 the wcc in cooperation with other partners is committed to supporting the secretariat of the forum as has been the case up to now
5302158 engage in dialogue with the church families and bodies represented in limuru
5302159 the global christian forum provides a new table of dialogue of which we can clearly say its our table not theirs
5302160 reflecting on the forums theme our journey with jesus christ the reconciler we need to acknowledge that often we have much to do in finding reconciliation among ourselves
5302161 the world council of churches commitment to the ecumenical vision goes beyond the existing ecumenical structures including itself
5302162 we are grateful for this safe environment that is the global christian forum in which we have been able not to feel intimidated by the mainline churches and their representatives
5302163 we catholics are deeply committed to the ecumenical movement it took us some time to get there but we are here and hope will be accepted as loyal partners and yes we want to be part of the global christian forum process which we see as vital
5302164 this global christian forum is clearly not an end but a beginning and at the conference of secretaries of christian world communions we are ready to do our best to contribute to it
5302165 if we do mission together we may discover our unity that is why christian mission needs to be in the forefront of the global christian forum process
5302166 there have been others before us and there will be others who will take over from us
5302167 because our goal does not depend on individual persons but rather is in gods hands
5302168 the problem was that it would be least effective when most needed
5302169 the governments top objective is to keep the public safe and i am disappointed that the courts have found that deportations to libya cant go ahead for now
5302170 the government should focus on prevention and prosecution rather than just trying to deport these individuals once they are here
5302171 which grabbed a lot of peoples attention if youre going to share a booth with someone this is a great guy to do it with

5302179 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur
5302180 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion
5302181 ive been a fan since i was a kid and their dynamite on stage
5302182 this website whilst appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles
5302183 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5302184 weve got to drill now and weve got to drill here and weve got to become independent on foreign oil

5302198 the party in its office bearers meet has decided to meet the election commission tomorrow expressing concern over irregularities in voting lists and some other issues are also on the cards
5302199 it is one of the partys concerns and demands and may also figure in the memorandum to be submitted to the election commission tomorrow
5302200 every publication is said to be blasphemous which contains any contemptuous reviling scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to god jesus christ or the bible or the formularies of the church of england as by law established
5302201 it is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the christian religion or to deny the existence of god if the publication is couched in decent and temperate language the test to be applied is as to the manner in which the doctrines are advocated and not as to the substance of the doctrines themselves
5302202 i am writing as a member of parliament who sponsored the cross party blasphemy abolition amendment to the criminal justice and immigration bill at report stage in the commons which prompted the government to pledge to introduce its own abolishing amendment in the lords after a short consultation with the church of england
5302203 i thought it might be helpful to provide a critique of the archbishops letter which is attached as well as a copy of the all too brief debate in the house of commons on january 9
5302204 it should be seen as a secularising move and with pride
5302205 everything is going to be all right it is nothing at all
5302206 this is a christian country simply in the unanswerable sense that most of the citizens think of themselves as christians
5302207 the courts extravagant interpretation of the legislation was no doubt convenient but is devoid of any legal merit
5302208 a petty unjust unforgiving control freak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic racist infanticidal genocidal filicidal pestilential megalomaniacal sadomasochistic capriciously malevolent bully
5302209 weve had problems in the past with certain types of preacher from different parts of the world not being familiar with the liberal british democratic mindset and bringing more literal interpretations of various aspects of islam which do not reflect the mindset of british muslims
5302210 british imams who originally came from india bangladesh and pakistan look up to figures from their home countries and they would have a lot of respect for them it would give them extra leverage and ammunition when talking about fighting radicalisation and terrorism
5302211 the muslim community does not have the institutions or capacity to train its own imams certain people who are graduating in traditional islamic sciences are not fit to be imams thats where the government and muslim organisations need to help out the most
5302212 how can the bbc think that such a view is moderate
5302213 it wouldnt be too wild a claim to say that nadia has single handedly saved the big brother franchise she certainly revitalised it giving it a much broader and deeper emotional appeal big brother 2003 when cameron the christian won was an acknowledged flop this year the makers endemol pulled out all the stops delivering evil big brother they were rewarded with nude lawn mowing bitterly polarised cliques sex under a table and a fight so bad the show was taken off the air temporarily not to mention the customary newspaper headlines screaming about exploitation and the moral decline of the nation whether you loved it or loathed it or did both at once no one could deny that big brother was on form again
5302214 the british nation is insidiously being converted to evolutionary humanism
5302215 is it too much to hope that somewhere in the bowels of the law courts there exists an english judge who will stand up for sanity and backbone in the face of all this
5302216 i fully recognise the full historical and cultural significance of christianity in our country
5302217 the christian tradition has had a significant impact on the way these freedoms have been shaped
5302218 most christians feel they are not getting a fair hearing
5302219 many shoppers find it increasingly difficult to buy greeting cards with references to christ advent calendars are extremely hard to find
5302220 christ always has been and always will be at the very heart of christmas taking christ out of christmas is like serving the christmas turkey without the stuffing
5302221 is the government prepared to stand by and surrender the nations christian traditions to parties of hate
5302222 time for the dragon of political correctness to be slain
5302223 it should be recognised that the war on terrorism even though necessary had as one of its side effects the spread of christianophobia in vast areas of the globe
5302224 some boys and girls have tied a rope around my neck and tried to tie me to a tree
5302225 he had not been hanged that was not correct and i couldnt understand why the press were insisting that he was
5302226 it is a situation which has created the moral and spiritual vacuum in which we find ourselves whilst the christian consensus was dissolved nothing else except perhaps endless self indulgence was put in its place
5302227 we are now however confronted by another equally serious ideology that of radical islamism which also claims to be comprehensive in scope it remains the case however that many of the beliefs and values which we need to deal with the present situation are rooted in the judaeo christian tradition
5302228 the question is not should faith have a role in public life
5302229 the integrity and autonomy of public authority and of the law will also have to be recognised and it would be best if religious law in its application was left to the communities public law should however continue to provide overarching protection for all
5302230 another day and another attack on islam and muslims by mr nazir ali
5302231 everything this man says is based on fiction and promoting intolerance and fear among communities
5302232 it is a situation which has created the moral and spiritual vacuum in which we find ourselves
5302233 can god create a bird that flies so fast he cant catch it
5302234 the human race loses its belief in gods as it matures and takes more responsibility for its actions
5302235 if any religion had the chance of ruling over england nay europe within the next hundred years it could be islam
5302236 the 1960s cultural revolution for bringing christianitys role in society to an abrupt end
5302237 such hatred for their ways as human beings have for urine and excreta
5302238 this was a politically correct attempt to close down reasoned discussion and debate its a matter of freedom of speech and democracy
5302239 people rub along fairly well together in the east end of london all different communities faiths colours and nationalities but tablighi jamaat have been antagonistic separatists since they were founded
5302240 incompatible with democracy uncivilised harbouring absolute hatred of jews not very fond of christians either
5302241 the indigenous christian community throughout the region has suffered from being associated with the american global project and indeed the british global project as part of the american global project
5302242 there is an urgent need for people in the uk to wake up to the fact that christians in the middle east are living through a time of change more dramatic and more costly than anything that has been seen for a thousand years and more
5302243 there is a quiet but numerically huge exodus of christians especially but not exclusively educated christians from the whole region the remaining christian communities are left exposed to violence or extremism in many countries and the societies they live in are deprived of some of their most creative and resourceful citizens
5302244 the military policies of the west in the last few years have firmly cemented in a great deal of the middle east the notion that christianity is a foreign aggressive and western presence
5302245 i regret it is a real tragedy that this ongoing crisis has yet to be the focus of policy declarations or indeed recognised by some of our western governments
5302246 multi culturalism has backfired spectacularly the disturbing rise of the political far right has been a direct result and i predict that the new incarnation multi faithism will be just as damaging
5302247 this is a false affidavit and we would demand an independent enquiry to verify the facts
5302248 but nobody has been punished till now for violation of the act
5302249 as far as implementation of programmes was concerned there seems to be confusion among the different departments and the centre and state governments
5302250 programmes are at a war footing and their effective monitoring are needed to achieve the goal
5302251 it was also an issue concerning scheduled castes as 100 per cent workers engaged in the work belonged to backward communities
5302252 this is not intended as a definitive list of what not to say but rather to highlight terms which risk being misunderstood and therefore prevent the effective reception of the message
5302253 this is not about political correctness but effectiveness evidence shows that people stop listening if they think you are attacking them
5302254 this data is now 6 7 years old and given high population growth in muslim communities is likely to be fairly out of date
5302255 there is no single profile of those most susceptible to these factors but they are likely to be young generally younger than 30 and male although the number of women who support and participate in violent extremism is increasing
5302256 no perceived grievance can justify terrorism but where concerns are legitimately expressed then we must be prepared to debate them
5302257 we are committed to better explaining existing policies such as the uks foreign policy refuting claims made about them in the language of violent extremists
5302258 help address the real grievances of people in key countries overseas which can increase their susceptibility to the extremists message
5302259 i dont need my mom or dad to buy me a 60 000 mercedes
5302260 people said it was too hard i wanted to prove them wrong
5302261 if i had a tough day id go to the mall to make myself feel better
5302262 if we just push as hard as we can for another 10 years or so there could be an explosion of financial growth at the end for us
5302263 its hard to see other couples living in their own houses the way they want
5302264 id say we could die in a car crash tomorrow so lets enjoy ourselves now
5302265 id like a really simple life where john and i can just spend more time together
5302266 the younger you retire the more conservative your withdrawal rate should be
5302267 i think its a safe investment to hold until the market comes up
5302268 i dont care what the stock is to diminish risk you need more diversification in your portfolio
5302269 i think those properties are going to come back eventually even if they dont our retirement plan is not based on any return from those properties anyway
5302270 sure it gets lonely sometimes but look i have a beautiful wife im happy ive got good friends
5302271 well i dont need a hundred friends that usually means a hundred gifts a year

5302283 this sharp fall looks like some stop losses have got triggered and even offshore markets are pointing to a weaker rupee
5302284 there was some talk it may intervene around the 43 50 per dollar but once that level broke conclusively it fell like a stone
5302285 i am extending the invitation to reach an acceptable solution to the issue through discussion

5302292 i volunteered to work for the intelligence services of all three countries because all of them had the same enemy
5302293 the only reward i expected was from god who teaches that if you save a life it is like you have saved all of humanity and if you kill it is as if you have killed all of humanity
5302294 mr hassaine was paid very little for his work but agreed to do so on the promise that citizenship would be arranged for him and his family and that he would be protected instead he has been threatened with deportation and his life has been put at great risk
5302295 i think theyre censoring it on theological grounds and because of the timing
5302296 ten days before lambeth there would be lots of bishops who would not be comfortable voting on the uniqueness of christ
5302297 i believe after the archbishops comments on sharia he would know there would be such press interest in it
5302298 from the telephone calls and emails i have received people feel very aggrieved that at this particular time in the churchs history synod was not given an opportunity to be debate evangelism
5302299 now that synod has electronic voting it would have been very easy to show how many of our bishops believed in the uniqueness of christ as the only means of salvation something which would have shown the division on orthodox views in the house
5302300 owing to time constraints the business committee has been able to schedule only one such motion for july on the subject of church tourism which heads the list in terms of the number of signatures from members
5302301 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
5302302 i would hope that both ends of the spectrum will say
5302303 one of the tragedies of our time is that an islamic world which has historically produced a vastly sophisticated material and poetic culture is threatened from within by those who acknowledge only the bare word of the sacred text divorced from learning and interpretation
5302304 well we are willing to take a step forward make some concessions to stay together
5302305 thats still our story we still need to look into that and recognize that we are capable of making a world in which such things happen
5302306 terrorism has no faith and we must all redouble our collective effort to deny any succour to its recruiting sergeants the mcb stands ready and willing to assist in every way it can
5302307 and as we found listening to all communities in june the vast majority of people of all faiths and backgrounds condemn terrorists and their actions
5302308 the objective of al qaeda and related groups is to manipulate political and humanitarian issues in order to gain support for their agenda of murder and violence and to deliberately maim and kill fellow human beings including innocent women and children we must not allow anyone to use terrorist activities as a means to divide us or isolate those belonging to a particular faith or community
5302309 the air is thick with suspicion and unease it is not good for the muslim community it is not good for society
5302310 cohesive and proud of its multi faith and multicultural composition
5302311 clearly sensible proposals designed to protect all of us from the terror threat as such they deserve the support of all sections of our society
5302312 the increased support that the government has announced for efforts to tackle extremism at the grassroots level is also to be welcomed we urge the government that in seeking delivery of this essential work at the grass roots level it must choose its partners with care and good sense ensuring that properly engaged and representative bodies are enlisted for support and not individuals whose claim to fame is the self alleged past association with brokers of fear and terror but now espouse neo conservative views
5302313 we have had synagogues in the uk for more than a hundred years serving local communities well
5302314 i thought that all of the recent terrorist attacks in the uk were carried out by islamists
5302315 as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearisome confused jumble crude incondite

5302332 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5302333 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5302334 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5302335 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5302336 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5302337 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5302338 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house

5302356 the purpose of my article was to point out that the best way for welcoming and integrating newer arrivals in this country should have been a christian vision of hospitality and not the secular policy of multi culturalism which has led to such disastrous consequences
5302357 i made clear in the article that my comments were about the particular impact of islamic extremism and were not about muslims in general
5302358 on a personal note i am sorry to say that since the article appeared threats have been made against the safety of my family and myself and have had to be reported to the police

5302360 when we started we decided we wouldnt go forward unless the paisley family agreed with it the town council in hetton were also over the moon with the idea and were nothing but helpful
5302361 the memorial is very close to the old eppleton colliery pitch where bob played as a lad
5302362 our aim as supporters of liverpool football club was to give the people of hetton le hole a fitting tribute to honour one of their greatest sons as well as acclaiming the town that we feel produced the most successful manager in british football history
5302363 we wanted to create a unique memorial befitting bob paisley which reflects the immense affection with which bob is held amongst liverpool supporters

5302365 it is representative of some muslims i know the koran says that anyone who goes away from islam should be killed as an apostate so in some ways my family are following the koran they are following islam to the word but i do not think every muslim would actually act on that
5302366 the word lapido means to speak up for in the acholi language of northern uganda
5302367 more muslims are turning away from islam and towards christ
5302368 she seems rather ignorant no where in the quran does it say to kill the apostate
5302369 the prophet said if any muslim discards changes his religion kill him

5302374 muslims are sentenced in syariah courts but we dont have the jurisdiction to sentence non muslims
5302375 their non muslim partners can probably be sentenced in the civil courts to be fair to both parties
5302376 it is up to the ags chambers or the relevant authorities to decide how to create such law
5302377 we dont have the jurisdiction to sentence non muslims committing khalwat with muslims
5302378 the muslims can be sentenced in syariah courts and the non muslim partners can probably be sentenced in the civil courts to be fair to both parties

5302381 jaminan ke atas hak hak tersebut terkandung dalam pelembagaan persekutuan
5302382 realiti yang berlaku di negara kita sejak negara mencapai kemerdekaan sampai ke hari ini menunjukkan setiap kaum dan bangsa tidak dinafikan hak hak mereka bahkan dalam beberapa perkara diberikan perlindungan dan jaminan melalui undang undang negara
5302383 bagi menjamin hak hak tersebut dihormati dan tidak dicabuli terdapat badan badan yang mengawasi termasuk mahkamah mahkamah diberi kuasa dan bebas untuk membicarakan isu menyalahi hak hak apabila berlaku pertikaian

5302385 i want to distance myself from what the bishop of rochester has said
5302386 there are no no go areas in this country that we are aware of and in all parts of the country there are good interfaith relationships developing
5302387 i believe we have good relationships with the muslim community here in oxford and i am personally very happy for the mosque to call the faithful to prayer in east oxford
5302388 that episode devoted to allison was one of the most bizarrely mesmerizing on television in who knows how long

5302390 no ghetto communities in britain racism is rife but it is not being expressed through rising levels of neighbourhood segregation
5302391 racial self segregation and increased racial segregation are myths for britain the repetition of these myths sends unhelpful messages to policy makers
5302392 let us be clear there is not a single ward in britain in which the population is a hundred per cent minority ethnic there are several wards where if one aggregates all minority ethnic populations they form the majority however 78 per cent of the minority ethnic populations do not live in such wards

5302404 overall sentiment is still bearish right now for commodity markets and i think in terms of what that means for commodity markets is we are likely to see people view pullbacks in the u s dollar as another buying opportunity
5302405 what you see are a series of what would otherwise be bullish news stories whether it is the conflict between russia and georgia and now the report that the transit rail line across georgia has been damaged failing to produce sustained rallies
5302406 the hurricane is largely irrelevant there is no shortage of refinery capacity in the united states even if the hurricane were to damage one of the refineries

5302411 infrastructure investments are a priority for nepals economic growth we are pleased to support the development of the aviation sector which is vital for the country
5302412 this project fits well with ifcs strategy for nepal and the wider region it is heartening to see that buddha air has transitioned from a start up to a profitable airline over the past decade
5302413 we look forward to helping the government introduce a system to assess the impact of regulations affecting businesses
5302414 we will build on ifcs extensive experience in implementing business environment reforms in the region to improve the quality of regulation and ensure the sustainability of reforms in uzbekistan
5302415 a new loan from ifc will create a strong platform for expanding our services to the sme sector

5302421 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
5302422 to regard with extreme repugnance or aversion detest utterly loathe abominate
5302423 in a search engine then read on this might help
5302424 it was a conscious decision we did it for each other and for family and friends

5302426 some people are cured from both blindness and deafness and there are cures for homosexuality now in gender changing
5302427 the fact is you cant its a lifestyle choice pure and simple
5302428 if the church of rome was a mere made up human institution it would have fallen under its own weight long before now
5302429 if you dont agree with gay marriage dont get one dont force the rest of us to listen to your moralising
5302430 have you not read that he who made a them at the beginning made them male and female b 5 and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh c 6 so then they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let not man separate
5302431 i was born gay i have always known it that to me is more natural
5302432 a natural man does not accept the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually appraised
5302433 its not about equality and fairness its about the teachings of god and christ
5302434 gay people have a chip on their shoulder get over it

5302441 will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5302442 there was an attack carried out by apparently milf elements affiliated under commander bravo but this is not sanctioned by the milf leadership
5302443 nonetheless after several hours of making contact with them and then a few hours ago the commanders were able to get in touch with them they were ordered to vacate the area immediately so the area is now cleared
5302444 i believe it can be saved and what is important here is the commitment of the milf to resolve the mindanao problems through peaceful negotiations
5302445 that commitment is here standing very good until now our effort remains sincere in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in mindanao
5302446 a traditional symbol of power especially in ancient egypt and china

5302450 we built the car in nine months for a practice run which was very successful
5302451 we got good media coverage and it was great experience for the team working on a real life project
5302452 now were running five research projects during the summer with a further 10 next year the difference for cuer is that the planning and build is integrated into the students academic work which we hope will give us the edge and were already seeing some exciting results
5302453 we use microsoft office professional 2007 and project 2007 to organise the team
5302454 its especially important during the summer vacation when members arent on campus managing everyone means we have to use proper project management and project allows us to do that easily this type of project just wouldnt have been possible a few years ago
5302455 to keep our sponsors up to date we produce a number of publications and newsletters for which we use microsoft publisher
5302456 its important to encourage young people to think about sustainable transportation and to show them that engineering is exciting that it uses cutting edge technology
5302457 theres a huge amount of interest across the university and this is a new thing for us to run 10 15 projects all focused on one goal

5302459 these camps are being used to imprison without trial or legal representation people that the regime wants the world to believe do not exist amid the miracle of modern china from street children hawkers the homeless and prostitutes to the mentally ill black migrants and gays caught in public bathhouses the camps on the outskirts of the city started filling up with beijings undesirables last year as part of the chinese regimes determination to present what it sees as an acceptable face to the world
5302460 government officials swept thousands of migrant workers out of beijing the very people who built the stadium at least 10 of them paying with their lives
5302461 according to chinese internet users it is the result of a policy to prevent the gathering of large and possibly uncontrollable crowds
5302462 will begin visible patrols on chinese internet sites to warn surfers they are being monitored on the look out for websites that incite secession promote superstition gambling fraud and pornography
5302463 the last year before the olympics for the first time in the history of china food safety rules for restaurants and eateries were put into place do you suppose there is a western style inspection and enforcement system now in place to support these new rules and laws think again
5302464 we always looked in control and i thought the second goal would come but west brom defended very well and we lacked a bit of sharpness around the box
5302465 we didnt get off to a great start we had one or two opportunities compared to their 15 or 20 but we go away believing we can compete in this league if we work as hard as we did today weve got a chance
5302466 we were on top in the second half and controlled the game we had chances and torres took his hes a key player who can change games
5302467 i was disappointed with the result but very pleased with the performance i was pleased with all the new players but we just did not do enough to get over the finishing line with a draw
5302468 we took the game to fulham we did not sit back
5302469 there is a lot of excitement in the city that we are here for the first time and weve got something to build on
5302470 you conservatives always have a f g ace in the hole dont you
5302471 to me the cut and shift american way of using a fork is silly and i find the tines down english way to be ineffective
5302472 you sir are an anarchist and miss manners is frightened to have anything to do with you it is true that questioning the table manners of others is rude but to overthrow the accepted conventions of society on the flimsy grounds that you have found them silly inefficient and discomforting is a dangerous step toward destroying civilization
5302473 das ist wie ich finde ein eindrucksvolles statement dass den dekostecker skeptikern arg zu denken geben wird italien
5302474 are we going to get back to the importance of supreme court justices

5302481 innocent nicey nice dont worry nothing is going to happen big smile with tillted head
5302482 a few months ago we were thinking about it i wouldnt want to say never but at this point its not something i think were going to do
5302483 el que suba la morosidad no es bueno pero las tasas actuales no est n muy lejanas de la media que ha existido en europa en los ltimos a os
5302484 el ajuste inmobiliario no es un tema de este a o es algo que viene de antes
5302485 firstly vendors should not be fixing problems or really anything in open source packages by patching them locally they should contribute their patches upstream to the package maintainers had debian done this in this case we the openssl team would have fallen about laughing and once we had got our breath back told them what a terrible idea this was
5302486 thus to store a string one could use a command like the following
5302487 the top half of the building rotates around the center of the circular track on which it rests which happens to form the roof of the lower static half of the building much like the hands of a clock
5302488 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5302489 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
5302490 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
5302491 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
5302492 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person
5302493 im drawing on 20 years of accumulated experience using models
5302494 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything
5302495 the most brilliant economist who never wrote down an equation

5302497 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
5302498 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
5302499 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
5302500 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
5302501 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
5302502 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
5302503 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5302504 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
5302505 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
5302506 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
5302507 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
5302508 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states

5302525 i love commission based structures because one sale instantly generates a lot of money the problem is that you will have to deal with an income that fluctuates a lot because you need to attract new readers that have not yet bought the product or service you are marketing for once your current readers have already bought it
5302526 the jurors may see her as a sweet little old lady she has been working to help kids and done a lot of charitable work

5302538 i was mad but i know stuff like that happens
5302539 i really had to push for it but i love this track and as its the last race of the season i didnt want to come away second
5302540 i had the plan to pass him at the end of the front straight going onto the last lap and thats what i did i knew that i was pretty good on the brakes into the last corners so i was happy to lead
5302541 he came past me up the inside into the last left hander but then ran wide i looked over and i knew that i could get him back at the right so i did
5302542 i really struggled through those first races just not being able to brake as well as i needed the braking has got a lot better but still needs a lot of improvement i know ive still got a long way to go but the rookies cup has made a road racer out of a dirt tracker
5302543 weve always said we want swimming in the u s to be like swimming in australia
5302544 thats what happens in australia the whole country stops what its doing to pay attention to swimming
5302545 mikes opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5302546 when something like this happens you have to back it up right away
5302547 right now swimming is really important to the american public its really important that we back that up this year now otherwise we go back into that abyss for another four years
5302548 we have to get the worlds on tv next year
5302549 nbc sports doesnt really control air time during the week
5302550 and swimming doesnt show up in a television meeting with 40 hours of programming theres not the volume or consistency
5302551 nbcs olympic relationship makes it hard talking to anybody else because the other networks dont want to be promoting a sport they view as a competitor
5302552 if we show up and have got sponors in tow to underwrite the broadcast costs they the networks will find time a lot quicker
5302553 u s swimming is at its peak so do we go down or can we keep it high and keep kids inspired

5302560 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5302561 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5302562 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5302563 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them

5302565 the planet faces a range of grave and interlinked challenges none of these problems becomes more tractable if population is ignored
5302566 fortunately a goal that is valid on its moral merits fairness to women also turns out to be pragmatic
5302567 unless governments focus on creating the conditions by which births result from the conscious decisions of women and their partners to parent a child theres no reason to be confident that global family size will fall to a two child average even if it does the grand one time only experiment how many of us can the earth and we ourselves sustain will continue for a few decades at least in the only available laboratory the only available home
5302568 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5302569 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5302570 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5302571 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5302572 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5302573 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5302574 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
5302575 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers

5302577 psychologists need to examine the attitudes and behaviors in the wider context of beliefs about environmental and social change
5302578 this was especially true for respondents who described themselves as democrats and those who said they trusted scientists
5302579 but for republicans and those who had little trust in scientists more knowledge did not mean there was more concern
5302580 if temperatures keep rising we can expect to see increased violence on the list of negative social consequences of global warming
5302581 psychologys contribution to cope with climate change a review of 20 years of research in europe
5302582 contributions of psychology to meeting the challenge of climate change opportunities for research
5302583 challenging issues and assumptions in the psychology of climate change
5302584 what americans think about climate change insights from 10 years of psychology inspired national surveys tracking public attitudes
5302585 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5302586 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
5302587 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
5302588 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis
5302589 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time
5302590 was nearly faded out a mishap said to have been caused many years ago by taking a copy by the anastatic process
5302591 an anastatic copy on parchment from the original for all historical purposes more important than the original as to make this they allowed the original document to be placed under a certain process which enabled the projectors of the scheme to take a facsimile from the original that this outrage was perpetrated on the original declaration only too plainly shows as it is so faded as to be hardly discernible to the naked eye and from which they were enabled to take a few impressions this therefore really portrays more truthfully what the document was than the original itself
5302592 this is a truly significant historic find especially since no one knew it even existed
5302593 it answers the mystery of what happened to the original declaration americas national treasure it certainty deserves to be described as priceless far more than any 80 million painting
5302594 an extraordinary discovery with a terrific story behind it this priceless and rare example is the only direct copy of the original declaration ever made and the fact that the resultant damage to the original makes another copy impossible amplifies its importance
5302595 the detective work involved in tracing the significance of the obscure short lived anastatic technique that made this faithful duplication possible enriches the story of this national treasure

5302618 you know when i first got the letter i was a little suspicious because a new jersey hall of fame i dont know does new york have a hall of fame does connecticut have a hall of fame i mean maybe they think they dont need one but then i thought like well let me see all right albert einstein bruce springsteen my mothers really gonna like that part so shes here tonight its her birthday its the only time those two names are gonna be mentioned in the same sentence is right now so im gonna enjoy it but when i was recording my first album the record company spent a lot of money taking a lot of pictures of me in new york city and something didnt quite feel right i was walking down the boardwalk one day and i stopped at a souvenir stand and bought a postcard saying greetings from asbury park i remember thinking yeah thats me i mean down south there was patti smith and up north right here in newark was george clinton and parliament funkadelic great musicians with the exception of i guess a few half years in california my family and i weve raised our kids here we got a big italian irish family and i found my own jersey girl here and in the end i just found something that grew deeply resonant like holding the hands of my kids on the same streets where my mom held my hand and swimming in the same ocean and visiting the same beaches i did as a child it was a place also that really protected me its been very nurturing i could take my kids down to freehold throw em up on my shoulders and walk along the street with thousands of other people on cruise nights with everybody just going hey bruce that was something that meant a lot to me the ability to just go about my life i was protected here by the people here and i really appreciated that so anyway you get a little older now you get those crisp fall days that come in september and the beginning of october my friends and i we slip into that cold water of that atlantic ocean these days you take note that theres a few less of your friends swimming alongside of you as each year passes but something about being in one place your whole life theyre all still around you in the water and i look towards the shore and i see my son and my daughter pushing their way through the waves and on the beach theres a whole batch of new little kids running away from the crashing surf like time itself thats what new jersey is for me its a repository now of just my time on earth my memory the music ive made friendships my life its all buried here at this point in a box somewhere in the sand down on the jersey shore and i cant imagine having it any other way but let me finish with a garden state benediction rise up my fellow new jerseyans for we are all members of a confused but noble race we of the state that will never get any respect we who bear the cruelness of the forever uncool a chip on the shoulders of those with forever something to prove and even with this wonderful hall of fame we know that theres another bad jersey joke just around the corner but fear not fear not this is not our curse it is our blessing for this is what infused us with our fighting spirit that we may salute the world forever with the fabulous jersey state bird raises middle finger and that the fumes from our great northern industrial area to the ocean breezes of cape may fill us with the raw hunger the naked ambition and the desire not just to do our best but to stick it in your face theory of relativity anybody how about some electric light with your day or maybe a spin to the moon and back thats right and that is why our fellow americans in those other 49 states know that when the announcer says and now in this corner from new jersey theyd better keep their hands up and their heads down cause when that bell rings we always come out swinging god bless the garden state
5302619 a surfer riding a wave the ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubble would be traveling faster than the speed of light
5302620 i t is challenging to make predictions on how this warp drive might function naively one could envision a spacecraft with an exotic power generator that could create the necessary energies to locally manipulate the extra dimension s in this way an advanced spacecraft would expand contract the compactified spacetime around it thereby creating the propulsion effect a sufficiently advanced technology with the ability to locally increase or decrease the radius of the extra dimension would be able to locally adjust the expansion and contraction of spacetime creating the hypothetical warp bubble discussed earlier a spacecraft with the ability to create such a bubble will always move inside its own local light cone however the ship can utilize the expansion of space time behind the ship to move away from some object at any desired speed or equivalently to contract the space time in front of the ship to approach any object
5302621 what right do they have to label people terrorists wahhabis
5302622 but when they attached the wires to my ears that was real torture
5302623 began to think they were not people but satans in uniform
5302624 anyone who does that automatically goes on a wahhabi list

5302680 i put all the blood the sweat you name it all the time into competing working out now its time for me to go out there tuesday and shine
5302681 i waited and waited donovan bailey and i were over there chatting and he said im a pretty confident guy i think youll get through so when he said that i was pretty convinced i would get through
5302682 being out there blind the whole race was tough but its the olympic games im blessed to be here if they made me run in the first row of the crowd i would have done that too
5302683 i dont think it was serious but i didnt want to go and risk any more damage turn a strain into a pull because i felt a little discomfort coming around the corner there so i just eased up
5302684 it keeps the intensity in the game in a blowout you can lose your concentration
5302685 it was pretty intense out there today and i think it was kind of whoever survived the day the best because they werent the best routines out there
5302686 its unlike any other competition when youre here because its your one chance to do well its tough to hit the routines and you saw a few mistakes out there
5302687 i just started this sport for fun and it wasnt an olympic sport
5302688 then it got into the olympics i went to three games and i have a third medal im still trying to soak it in i think
5302689 ive been asking myself the same question for the last couple of weeks especially this morning
5302690 but trainings gone well so i thought what the heck its good fun
5302691 it was crowded around the first marker its fight or sink
5302692 teams are a great way to get into it if you dont want to do all three
5302693 there were a number of people in the try a tri that made their first crack at this kind of thing this weekend
5302694 the players are well aware of the positive impact that they can have on those growing up
5302695 i am proud that they have taken the initiative to support this important programme
5302696 the tragic deaths of conor black in manchester and nilanthan murddi in croydon show why the work in the action programme is so important
5302697 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty
5302698 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve
5302699 enforcement action is only one part of the solution i am pleased that the england football team will be supporting our marketing campaign it doesnt have to happen urging young people not to carry knives
5302700 i want to reinforce our commitment to tackling knives and getting them off our streets
5302701 working with the police local authorities the health service and partners like the fa we will do all we can to protect young people their families and communities from the fear and grief of knife crime
5302702 knife crimes causes massive grief and pain to both the victims families and their communities and that is why we have a duty both to the public and the victims of these awful crimes to take a tough approach to those who carry knives

5302704 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5302705 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5302706 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support

5302713 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this
5302714 if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response we have all the necessary resources political economic and military
5302715 i can say for certain when the new year will come but i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet
5302716 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5302717 lets hope that this is a technical slowness in getting implemented lets see the russians begin to pull back thats what wed like to see but we havent seen it yet
5302718 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5302719 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5302720 we are aware that the georgian side can undertake provocative actions at any moment against our troops as well as the civilians
5302721 we cant rule out the use of slavic looking people dressed like russian military for provocations and sabotage
5302722 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5302723 they fled meanly like traitors from south ossetia just before the shooting started

5302731 i had a line and i wouldve pulled the game and eaten the loss
5302732 its his intellectual property and he can do what wants
5302733 how many people think climate change is a serious problem
5302734 so what are we going to do about climate change if it is a serious problem how are we going to stop it
5302735 so this is great basically we are talking two general types of solutions clean power generation and saving energy or using it more efficiently i do a bunch of work on energy best guesses are these two approaches will net perhaps 20 reductions each so we are talking carbon levels by 40 except the un commission on climate change says we have to reduce emissions by 80 by 2050 so where it is going to come from is humanity doomed
5302736 well there is a very powerful technique which could save us it is a concept we learned in kindergarden its called
5302737 its irresponsible for a man of his position to make these comments
5302738 he should accept that britain is a multicultural society in which we are free to follow our religion at the same time as being extremely proud to be british we wouldnt allow no go areas to happen i smell extreme intolerance when people criticise multiculturalism without proper evidence of what has gone wrong
5302739 bishop nazir ali has drawn attention to a deeply serious problem the governments confused and counter productive approach risks creating a number of closed societies instead of one open cohesive one it generates the risk of encouraging radicalisation and creating home grown terrorism
5302740 bishop nazir ali appears to be exercised by what he perceives as the decline in the influence of christianity upon this country but trying to frantically scaremonger about islam and muslims seems to us to be a rather unethical way of trying to reverse this
5302741 he talks about the rise of islamic extremism but fails to mention how some of the policies of our government and especially that of the united states in the middle east over several decades now has clearly contributed to this phenomenon
5302742 there is no god but god and muhammad is his messenger
5302743 shame on you all for sleepwalking over the precipice and not standing up for your nation and your heritage
5302744 if once you have paid him the danegeld you never get rid of the dane
5302745 if you had to deduce their strategy over the past thirty years it would be first the creation an islamic consciousness in other words the women wear hijab everyone eats halal meat those very basic things that give visibility to the muslim community they know who they are and their sharia their law becomes operative
5302746 and secondly to create organizations within institutions for example the islamic womens society an islamic leaders society an islamic education society
5302747 once they have that in place they move to the third stage which is to say to their local authority that we have got lots of muslim children in school should not the school cater for our children in terms of dress in terms of ramadan in terms of food in terms of education
5302748 so what has happened as they have engaged the political structures at the local unclear national level so now that islam has been accepted and brought into the center
5302749 the process of migrating and establishing a muslim community in a non muslim context has an important place in islamic theology
5302750 muslims see the establishment of a muslim community in the uk as a contemporary hijra
5302751 a book published in 1980 by the islamic council of europe gives instructions for how muslim minorities are to work towards achieving domination of european countries through a policy of concentration in geographical areas
5302752 two other islamic principles are important subjects of debate amongst contemporary muslims
5302753 we need a referendum now on whether to stop further immigration
5302754 watch out that no one deceives you for many will come in my name claiming to be the christ and will deceive many you will hear of wars and rumours of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed such things must happen but the end as still to come nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all these are the beginning of birthpains then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me
5302755 at that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate one another and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people because of the increase of wickedness the love of many will grow cold but he who stand s firm till the end will be saved
5302756 shame on you all for sleepwalking over the precipice and not standing up for your nation and your heritage
5302757 raila odinga the current frontrunner in the upcoming presidential election in kenya has promised that he will implement strict islamic sharia law if he receives the muslim vote in the country and is elected president
5302758 in a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5302759 this required that people should be facilitated in living as separate communities continuing to communicate in their own languages and having minimum need for building healthy relationships with the majority
5302760 the minarets are our bayonets the domes are our helmets the mosques are our barracks the believers are our soldiers
5302761 there are muslim men in britain who marry and divorce three women then marry a fourth time and stay married in sharia law to all four
5302762 the more fundamentalist clerics think that it is only a matter of time before they will persuade the government to concede on the issue of sharia law given the governments record of capitulating you can see why they believe that

5302795 your eminence this is not about separation of church and state this is about rebuilding the city
5302796 ill leave the spiritual matters to you archbishop but i am telling you that in order to maintain spirit in the city we need things that are endearing to the people to stay open
5302797 i know youre worried that if you change your mind about some churches than what about the others that have already closed but not all the churches are equal it is like our neighborhoods some have more people who are able to rebuild than others dont close some parishes because you have had to close others
5302798 i know other cities are having to close churches too this is not unique to new orleans what is unique though is that no other city has faced a disaster like new orleans has no other city needs to give its people reasons to come back as new orleans does
5302799 you can help this city rebuild not by closing things but by keeping them open where there is a spark of enthusiasm man give it a chance to burn

5302811 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalised but he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh
5302812 p thomas is a martyr said msgr marampudi archbishop of hyderabad on hearing of the brutal murder the indian church is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in this country
5302813 priests and nuns continues the archbishop of hyderabad have for decades been at the service of the least fortunate in india and this makes them targets of forces of evil who do not want the marginalized and impoverished to become empowered
5302814 hey bob you have a lot of well wishers here by that i mean theyd like to throw you down one
5302815 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5302816 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5302817 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5302818 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5302819 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5302820 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5302821 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5302822 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5302823 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5302824 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5302825 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5302826 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5302827 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest

5302829 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5302830 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5302831 we hope a deal can be finalised in the fullness of time
5302832 unless tsvangirai signs on the dotted line the crisis continues not only simply because the billions of foreign aid does not become available but also because he does represent a significant majority of the zimbabwean population

5302896 durante mucho tiempo el tabaco burley misionero no ha sido reconocido con precios satisfactorios para el productor este a o se avanz en algo con el precio pero est lejos de ser el que verdaderamente le corresponder a recibir al que produce un tabaco de excelente calidad reconocido internacionalmente como uno de los mejores cumpliendo con todos los requerimientos de los compradores llevando adelante programas de buenas pr cticas agr colas utilizando insumos que le solicitan nuestro productor fue un adelantado en la eliminaci n del bromuro de metilo est reduciendo el consumo de agroqu micos a trav s de un programa manejo integrado de plagas y enfermedades que es nico a nivel mundial

5302900 solamente la educaci n ser la llave para alcanzar la libertad no existe pueblo que pueda alcanzar su libertad si no tiene los elementos que la educaci n le da como para saber manejarse en la vida
5302901 mucho se ha dicho en esta ma ana del compromiso de san mart n con la libertad y la soberan a ten a muy claro que no alcanzaba con la libertad de un pueblo de latinoam rica que el continente todo deb a caminar hacia el rumbo de la independencia y asumi as los desaf os m s contundentes como cruzar los andes y llevar adelante esa epopeya de liberar a chile y luego al per ten a tambi n absolutamente claro que toda vez que se marca un liderazgo se deben asumir los compromisos m s all de las adversidades junto a bol var han escrito las p ginas m s gloriosas de la historia latinoamericana cada uno aport lo suyo cada uno hizo su contribuci n para que el continente todo sea libre y soberano
5302902 como es com n en nuestro pa s en nuestra historia no siempre se tiene el acompa amiento del resto de las fuerzas de la pol tica san mart n llev adelante en soledad muchos de estos procesos no solamente en soledad sino con la adversidad del pa s central pero ah ten a otra cosa absolutamente clara el h roe m ximo de los argentinos siempre estuvo dispuesto a la guerra para liberar a am rica pero nunca a empu ar un arma para combatir para desangrar para desunir a los hermanos argentinos
5302903 cuando vio que su misi n estaba cumplida y que no todos ten an ese mismo sentimiento de libertad latinoamericana y de uni n nacional s lo parti a su silencioso destierro ese general que nos deja a nosotros estos elementos perm tanme decirles que ten a raz n el intendente hay que tratar de hacer entender a la gente estos valores hoy la figura del gran capit n se agiganta con el tiempo y m s que nunca los conceptos de libertad y de soberan a se encuentran vigentes porque todav a no podemos decir con certeza que nuestro continente es un continente libre empezamos a dar ahora pareciera ser los primeros pasos con gobiernos que buscan el bien com n y una identidad y soberan a propia como el gobierno de cristina fern ndez de kirchner en argentina de lula en brasil la esperanza que enciende lugo en paraguay correa en ecuador evo morales en bolivia empezamos despu s de muchos a os a dibujar un escenario latinoamericano propio sin depender de los designios de otras fuerzas siempre estuvimos bajo la tutela de europa y de los estados unidos
5302904 el desaf o es duro y solamente lo vamos a lograr si estamos unidos entre los latinoamericanos y unidos los argentinos y los misioneros m s que nunca quiero recordar que no vamos a poder lograr conceptos como la libertad y la soberan a si no tenemos un pueblo educado con una educaci n primaria que debe dar paso a una sana clara y eficiente educaci n media la educaci n solamente ser la llave para alcanzar la libertad no existe pueblo que pueda alcanzar su libertad si no tiene los elementos que la educaci n le da como para saber manejarse en la vida algunos tendr n m s otros tendr n menos pero todos deben tener la oportunidad de educarse y de terminar la escuela primaria y por lo menos luego la escuela secundaria
5302905 en estos tiempos no vamos a poder hablar de soberan a si no tenemos dos elementos alimentos y energ a de eso va a depender mucho nuestra soberan a y nuestra libertad y va a depender mucho la calidad de vida de nuestros pueblos tenemos a la producci n de alimentos como una de las pol ticas centrales de este gobierno y s que el intendente lo entiende bien y que lleva adelante estas pol ticas tenemos que aprovechar cada cent metro cuadrado del suelo misionero para producir los alimentos para tener nuestra soberan a alimentaria para comer los misioneros lo que nosotros mismos producimos para no depender del vaiv n de los precios internacionales para no depender de los cierres de las exportaciones y para no depender de los cortes de ruta los misioneros debemos tener nuestra propia y clara pol tica alimentaria siempre cruzo la ruta 211 y miro una chacra que est ac a 10 kil metros por ah y la pongo como ejemplo que aprovecha cada cent metro de su tierra que tiene la mandioca entre la yerba que tiene la plantaci n de verdura que tiene c tricos y anan que en cada lugarcito de la tierra saca provecho para la producci n de alimentos por eso acompa amos todas estas decisiones como las pol ticas ganaderas que se llevan adelante en este municipio bien me dec a el intendente tenemos que tratar no de regalar vacas para que el porcentaje de parici n sea del 30 del 40 por ciento todos deben saber manejar su ganado y llegar a porcentajes de parici n del 70 80 90 por ciento
5302906 la energ a tambi n es un elemento y est muy bien planteada la discusi n este pueblo tiene los complejos del saltito una de las pruebas de que se puede trabajar con microaprovechamientos pero tambi n sabemos que es muy limitada la capacidad de generaci n de estos peque os emprendimientos el gobierno provincial trabaja hoy en la generaci n de varias l neas de energ as alternativas para que tengamos nosotros esta soberan a que tambi n dominar la libertad de los pueblos en los pr ximos a os

5302916 this is so even if the husband is still living with the previous wife and to issue the entry clearance would lead to the formation of a polygamous household
5302917 you are not allowed to have multiple marriages in the uk so to have a situation where the benefits system is treating people in different ways is totally unacceptable and will serve to undermine confidence in the system
5302918 this sets a precedent that will lead to more demands for the culture of other countries to be reflected in uk law and the benefits system

5303155 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5303156 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5303157 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5303158 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home

5303163 uu pilpres itu sangat bahaya karena pencalonan presiden hanya untuk partai politik parpol saja
5303164 secara matematis kalau negara tanpa parpol negara tetap berjalan sebaliknya negara tanpa warga negara maka negara tidak akan berjalan
5303165 uu pilpres itu melanggar prinsip logis konstitusi yang dapat ditafsirkan bahwa warga negara berparpol menjadi kelas satu dan warga negara non berparpol merupakan kelas dua
5303166 setiap warga negara berhak mendapatkan jaminan persamaan kedudukan dan kesempatan dalam hukum dan pemerintahan tanpa diskriminasi
5303167 maka ketentuan pasal 1 angka 6 pasal 5 ayat 1 dan pasal 5 ayat 4 uu pilpres yang menutup kemungkinan pasangan calon presiden dan wakil presiden dari calon independen telah melanggar hak hak para pemohon yang dijamin dalam uud 1945

5303182 from now on it was all about how we decided to govern our lives there was something creepy about his kennedyesque cadences and his well practiced call to arms but what he said would be repeated throughout my time at harvard h b s was a brand as much as a school and by attending we were associating ourselves with one of the greatest brands in business
5303183 in many ways i loved my two years at harvard
5303184 for me and everyone i knew harvard changed the view of our futures and the possibilities available to us through business
5303185 h b s need only promise to educate students in the process and management of business
5303186 it would be a noble and accommodating goal and would dilute the perception of the school and its graduates as a megalomaniacal self sustaining elite

5303191 we started in 1993 with one lone developer ian murdock
5303192 today we have over 1 000 registered developers scattered all over the world with thousands more in the community working on parts of the system packages documentation and translation
5303193 we can also fairly claim to be one of the most stable and reliable distros too we dont expect our users to ever have to re install their systems
5303194 we were one of the first projects to understand that the real power of open source software is to include the community
5303195 theres been a lot about debian that just happened but that was very deliberate i was a student i had limited time and i knew that i wasnt going to be able to do all this myself so we set out specifically to figure out how we could leverage a distributed workforce i remember that when the project started people were saying that farming out all these pieces to developers would never work but it actually worked out pretty well i think that debians influence in how open source development is done cant be overstated
5303196 it was really the first linux distribution to adopt the package system from unix
5303197 it turned out to be a really good metaphor for system management too
5303198 i think debian has come a long way in the last few years
5303199 we have tackled several key problems that have troubled us for ages from a technical point weve made debian much easier to install configure and use processes and community wise we have made a lot of changes youll find that the debian community is quite pleasant and that to a large extent we no longer deserve the bad reputation of a hostile community
5303200 finally there have been major improvements to our core teams many of our teams have had structural problems for years and showed little activity but lately weve been able to add new contributors to a number of teams such as the release security and ftpmaster teams and theres a lot of energy in those teams

5303233 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
5303234 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
5303235 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
5303236 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
5303237 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
5303238 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
5303239 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
5303240 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
5303241 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
5303242 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
5303243 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
5303244 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
5303245 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
5303246 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
5303247 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
5303248 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

5303250 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
5303251 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
5303252 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
5303253 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
5303254 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
5303255 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
5303256 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
5303257 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
5303258 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
5303259 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

5303374 mike first off i just want to say thank you so much the techniques i learned from butterfly marketing played a big part in helping me make 63 249 in sales in 24 hours as i write this im still finding it hard to believe it seems a lifetime ago that the bfm package landed on my doorstep and i started poring over it with my smile getting larger and wider with each new insight as i realized that as long as i applied what i was learning the principles were going to make something big happen little did i know just how big it would be when i launched adsense videos adsense videos 33 hours after launch the site went live my life changed forever seriously the results have been incredible mike weve grossed over 200 000 in 7 days the site got an alexa ranking on launch day of 351 adsense videos was ranked number 1 on the clickbank marketplace in the marketing category just 4 days after the launch ive also been getting on average one new subscriber every minute of every hour for the past six and a half days so what did i learn from you mike and from butterfly marketing where to start i think one of the biggest things was the step by step approach everything i created for affiliates joint venture partners and for people going through the videos themselves has been step by step i made everything as easy as i could and muppet proof as i like to call it i also realized that its paying attention to the smaller details before launch that really pay dividends after the launch and boy am i seeing that you gave some absolute gems of advice in butterfly marketing which have without a shadow of a doubt contributed in a big way to the overall success of adsense videos thanks again michael cheney

5303975 this especially appears for women who are in fear of sanctions either by state authorities or by their own community the permanent fear of deportation and uncertainty even worsen the situation thousands of kurds being traumatized due to war and torture still have not been recognized as political asylum seekers just to give an example a mother with two children whose husband was killed by so called unknown forces while she was raped by turkish soldiers now has been waiting for 10 years for the dutch authoritys decision on her asylum application

5304159 in the months since my return from alaska i had been feeling helpless angry and frustrated working for secretary ickes i knew that jews were fleeing bombs terror anti semitism what were we the u s doing to help them almost nothing we saved famous people like albert einstein marc chagall and the german novelist lion feuchtwanger whose defining novel the oppermanns told the story of hitlers rise to power i wrote a preface for a new edition in 2001 but except for saving such people we were doing shamefully little to stop the annihilation of six million jews

5304169 neutralizing antibodies derived from the b cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors
5304170 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5304171 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5304172 the fact that you can isolate these anti 1918 memory b cells so long after infection will hopefully provide the impetus to further study the mechanisms behind long lived immunity
5304173 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralizing antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to nine decades after exposure
5304174 these findings could serve as potential therapy for another 1918 like virus

5304276 for the agricultural industry to thrive and for pennsylvania to remain competitive with other states we must address the veterinarian shortage

5304293 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as valencia
5304294 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up
5304295 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points

5304314 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5304315 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive

5304317 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5304318 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5304319 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5304320 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5304321 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5304322 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going

5304337 we strongly condemn this reproductive health bill as an outright violation of the fundamental rights of men women children and families enshrined in our philippine constitution and a blatant opposition to our moral principles as a christian nation
5304338 this shameful railroading of a seriously flawed bill by our elected and trusted lawmakers is indeed a manifestation of the sad state of governance in our country
5304339 other ambiguous terms like family planning reproductive health right health education and health care gender quality and equity among others just heighten our suspicions that the bill is primarily and truly anti life anti marriage and anti family
5304340 i am renewing my call for president bush to treat these incarcerated border agents with at least the same consideration he showed to his friend and confidant scooter libby whose sentence he commuted the time is now to permit ignacio ramos and jose alonso compean to return to their families
5304341 the jury heard all of the evidence the jury returned the verdict the jury did not believe the border patrol agents it convicted them the governments evidence if believed is sufficient to uphold the convictions and that is pretty close to the bottom line on guilt or innocence of these agents
5304342 the part of the story they should have heard is this guy was a career criminal
5304343 it means if you use your weapon in self defense you too can be looking at ten years in federal prison
5304344 it is a travesty that these men must suffer this injustice through the courts because they did their jobs any remote impropriety on their part has been satisfied by the length of time these agents have already served we are now witness to a perverse miscarriage of judicial resources
5304345 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people
5304346 is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
5304347 requires giving up on the illusions of grandeur to which the end of the cold war and then 9 11 gave rise it also means reining in the imperial presidents who expect the army to make good on those illusions
5304348 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5304349 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5304350 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment

5304353 los jugadores son los primeros que se tienen que adaptar al sistema porque la gente viene a ver al equipo jugar bien y no un sistema de juego

5304468 he likes to brag about how many times hes been to iraq
5304469 but hes never served and he doesnt really know how the military works
5304470 it is important that this era in our history is never forgotten
5304471 hyde park is a fitting site for a permanent memorial to the millions who lost their lives and the courageous people who fought to end the brutal transatlantic slave trade

5304475 in 2lst century multi lingual scotland its not reasonable to expect people to communicate by gestures and guesswork

5304477 using flash cards and providing a professional interpreting service is an important step in establishing effective communication from the start
5304478 the company wants to respond to current and growing customer demand by sourcing and supplying more local fresh foods uwe will help it achieve a culture change and become a more locally focussed business while maintaining traditional values of service
5304479 as a long standing family owned company focusing firmly on frozen food distribution we have felt for sometime that we need to understand our local market better so that we can develop our product range and improve the service we offer to existing and prospective customers
5304480 as a result of securing the ktp grant we can proactively focus on our local market which in the long term will have significant benefits for our customers ourselves and the environment
5304481 we note that competitors in the m2m space have experienced slowness in the overall market to develop

5304485 the first half in particular was not good enough we know that
5304486 it was tough for us at the start of the game they came out of the blocks really quickly and set a really high tempo which youd expect because it was their first home game of the season
5304487 they put us under a lot of pressure and maybe we were a little bit slow to get going
5304488 it was certainly not the best game we have played but the important thing was that we got better in the second half and at the end fernando popped up with a goal and that was enough to win the game
5304489 the most important thing is that we got the win
5304490 the only people who can give things a lift at the minute are the players who are here
5304491 the fans have been terrific and tried to stay behind the team we have just got to get on with things because nobody is going to feel sorry for us
5304492 weve got a small squad but we believe its a good one and i want to keep everybody involved this season
5304493 i was delighted with the attitude and the character we showed for the spurs game and i want to have a look at a couple of games before making a final decision
5304494 im pleased to have added justin hoyte to the squad but we have no more bids in at the moment and it may stay that way
5304495 it may leave us a little bit short but then we have players who have proved they can play in a number of positions

5304597 the primal urge to run and hide in the face of imminent danger it is a sudden fear which dominates or replaces thinking and often affects groups of people or animals
5304598 even more unfortunate is the probable source of this irrational fear of irrational fear by public health officials a reflexive lack of respect for the reasonableness and good sense of ordinary people confronted with a threat properly explained to them
5304599 what you have in effect is a supersaturated solution of perfectly justified mistrust
5304600 theyd rather do political stunts than be at the negotiating table
5304601 on his right cheek was a scar two fingers thick which roped from the corner of his thick lips and disappeared beneath his ear the scars flesh was lighter than his skin like a crack on the top of a cake when the batter rises and splits the browned crust the left side of his mouth opened in a smile but the scarred side remained serious paralyzed his fingers were short and thick like a cluster of bananas

5304615 if hes the obedient type as my son was you can let him leave the room and run up and down the hall if he gets antsy
5304616 if he can entertain himself with crayons and paper or quiet toys then let him if you have a laptop or if a classmate does and is willing to bring it to class you can plug the kid into a set of earphones and let him watch a dvd during class
5304617 find out which profs arent assholes but feel free to impose even on the assholes once or good for them if the chair is a good sort enlist his or her help and backing ditto your advisor with them behind you the asshole profs will have to suck it up
5304618 if youre teaching same advice obviously you dont want your son there so much that he becomes a huge distraction and if he cant behave reasonably well not perfectly but reasonably then dont bring him but i brought mine and let him run around behind me tearing up paper and throwing confetti while my students and i sat around the seminar table

5304649 for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign as president
5304650 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future
5304651 it will be accepted there is no second opinion about that
5304652 a lot of it felt like it didnt matter and i was just going through the motions because i had no choice
5304653 i was with kids who were more serious and loved learning and i started learning in a different way all of a sudden i really started to love studying
5304654 one time the school had a fire alarm go off and all the kids had to go outside for an hour i remember being upset over having to miss a class thats how much i had changed
5304655 we as parents do a very poor job of connecting the dots we say go to school so you can have a better future when they know tons of people who succeed without a formal education
5304656 when michael phelps was about to win his ninth gold medal i said to them that only four human beings have ever achieved that who were the other four
5304657 ask yourself is your home a place where learning is valued
5304658 make it like youre involved in it ask them lots of questions about how they feel
5304659 so take an interest in the school and make sure your kids arent so overloaded with homework that they stop loving learning
5304660 talk with your kids about what theyre doing and make studying more of a family activity for example i love writing when my kids write essays i always ask to read them after we discuss them and then polish them together and the child feels like its something we do together
5304661 viele kollegen notieren sich alles akribisch was sie jemals gekocht haben und ich selber habe eine rezeptdatei von einzelrezepten aber letztendlich bewahre ich mir nichts auf und das mache ich bewusst weil man so immer wieder gefordert ist etwas neues zu machen sich weiter zu entwickeln man kann dann eben nicht mal schnell im computer oder in kladden nachschauen f r mich ist das eine gute art und weise sich stetig weiter zu entwickeln sich pers nlich da einen druck aufzubauen man muss st ndig nach neuen produkten schauen nach guten produkten und es ist auch basis meiner k che dass wir versuchen gute produkte zu benutzen und die dann so heraus zu arbeiten dass man ende beispielsweise den spanferkelbauch im gericht auch wirklich schmecken kann

5304665 the reception issues began immediately with 3g flip flopping between no signal and up to four bars but usually hovering between none and two
5304666 kelly just sat down with me and my mom and my dad and said your son has the potential to make it to the nhl or get drafted into the nhl and play professional hockey
5304667 you have to have the right attitude and get in shape get your eating habits better and i think everything will come and fall into place for you
5304668 he didnt know how to train he loved being on the ice he was a rink rat we said you have potential but this is what you have to do to commit yourself hes a big happy go lucky kid that loves the game
5304669 the only thing they chase and macinnis told me was work out every day and do the right things to make you a better hockey player
5304670 it was my own decision to go out in the gym and work out ride the bike my second year in st louis i did the hockey treadmill throughout the whole season i worked out
5304671 i called paul holmgren and i had a good rapport with him when we were in hartford
5304672 holmgren said they had him rated and he said he was going to look into it i said i think this kid can play and hes really going to turn things around here in the next couple years
5304673 i did pretty good in londons 2004 rookie camp and i went back for main camp
5304674 i came back overweight and out of shape and they said youre not ready for this and they sent me home
5304675 i said i think i can play in this league ohl and i proved a lot of people wrong
5304676 i went up there with a good attitude thinking they would help me out and i helped their team out and it all worked out
5304677 it isnt just his size he has good hands good skills he can pass the puck hes a go to guy and that is something we need hes a difference maker he can beat guys 1 on 1 there are some things he needs to clean up he needs to get himself in better shape and then his skating will get better but hes working on it
5304678 hes got million dollar hands he can put the puck in the net and make plays
5304679 we sat him down when he was in at the end of the phantoms season and talked to him in a very harsh way about what he needed to do in terms of conditioning and hes worked at it
5304680 i think it shows on the ice i think his skating still needs to pick up a notch hes got great hands hes got a great offensive mind for the game
5304681 my feet got a little faster theyre not fast but theyll get better its a process losing weight was a process the eating habits is a process
5304682 i love waking up and working out thinking to myself if i go in the gym every day from here on out i can be a better hockey player be better conditioned to go out there and play in the nhl
5304683 if his skating continues to get better and his conditioning continues to get better
5304684 my most embarrassing hockey moment came last year when we were playing the london knights
5304685 it was the last game before the christmas break and it was on sportsnet so it was televised nationally across canada i remember getting pretty excited for that game and it was a great game went into overtime i had a few chances but i couldnt score
5304686 and then it went into the shootout and i remember with the sarnia london rivalry it was packed in our arena i had a chance to win it and the crowd was going crazy everyone was standing up and i could just remember being so nervous going up to the puck in the shootout and i went down and i went to make a move and i can remember the puck just going flying into the corner and i didnt even get a shot off it was on national tv and i can remember just going back to the bench and i think i broke my stick over the boards i went home the next day and watched my old minor midget team and i remember getting heckled coming into the rink one guy asked me what i was going to ask santa for christmas and if it was how to take a shootout
5304687 my most embarrassing hockey moment would have to be falling on a shootout
5304688 my most embarrassing hockey moment was probably when i was younger
5304689 i remember we were in the finals and they were calling out the starting lineup and so skating out to the blue line i took a little spill there so i got a little laugh from the crowd and that was pretty funny
5304690 my most embarrassing hockey moment is falling down in warm up last year
5304691 it was one of my first games in the ohl my helmet fell off went face first smacked my face on the ice and hurt my nose and my cheek i was bruised up for a bit i didnt know what to do but i kept skating it was pretty embarrassing for me
5304692 one time i was running a hockey camp with one of my assistant coaches and all the kids were excited to see me there
5304693 this is when i just got drafted into the ohl and i was demonstrating a drill and wiped out and they kind of laughed at me and i got a little red
5304694 my most embarrassing hockey moment is when i was in a novice hockey tournament and we went into overtime but it was the overtime where the goalies are pulled
5304695 so you get an extra guy out there and i tried passing the puck back to the d man and the d man missed it and it went in our own net so we lost the final game of the tournament
5304696 the ebbets field location like all of our new york facilities is designed to provide an exceptional customer experience from its premium security features to the many amenities that make renting with us an easy storage option this facility illustrates why safeguard is a leader in the

5304698 we look forward to getting to know and serve the residents and business people of ebbets field its a great community and were proud to be part of it

5304710 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

5304712 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5304713 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5304714 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5304715 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5304716 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5304717 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5304718 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5304719 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5304720 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5304721 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5304740 their motive is plain and simple terrorism and banditry they shot two innocent civilians who were just enjoying singing in a videoke bar
5304741 their motive is simply to sow terror and to loot but our brave policemen despite being severely outnumbered fought back and they succeeded in depending the town
5304742 this was just part of our security precaution as we expect the trouble to spill over to other areas of the region
5304743 the conflict had already started and we expect this to go on for undetermined number of days they imt are no longer needed here
5304744 for more than a week our emissaries including local milf commanders have been convincing them to vacate the area to avoid trouble
5304745 we have no other option now but to use arms to drive them out we have to protect our people and seek justice for the innocent victims

5304765 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5304766 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5304767 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5304768 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5304769 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5304770 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5304771 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5304772 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5304773 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5304774 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5304775 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5304776 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5304777 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5304778 this little higher number is probably the result of lower gas prices the economy remains pretty weak and consumer sentiment reflects that

5304804 eu competi em muitas corridas de rua quando disputava a champ car e nessa temporada quase todas as pistas foram novas para mim ent o eu tenho que aprender para me adaptar rapidamente
5304805 me parece um circuito interessante e bem largo por isso deve ser um bom show
5304806 durante as ltimas corridas percebemos que a velocidade de curva aumentou muito por isso precisamos conversar com os organizadores sobre o assunto
5304807 abordamos o assunto com o comit de seguran a no entanto devido import ncia do assunto decidimos discutir com todo o paddock convidamos todos a uma reuni o e propomos algumas id ias agora levaremos essas id ias ao comit geral
5304808 it is highly probable that a considerable volume of sales recently made were based on credit ratings only justifiable on the theory that flush times were to continue indefinitely when the process of expanding credit ceases and we return to a normal basis of spending each year there must ensue a painful period of readjustment
5304809 the county is at every meeting show up and ask them
5304810 gibbs is the sort of player arsenal will loan out signing a premier league player for the season could be very attractive to a club like ours
5304811 hes an outstanding prospect but the feeling is he is a little too young for what we need
5304812 love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of withering of tarnishing
5304813 dont bother coming out im not going through with it
5304814 as a business o2 is all about helping our customers connect to the people and things that matter to them enabling them to be in touch wherever they are in the world
5304815 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5304816 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5304817 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5304818 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5304819 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5304820 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5304821 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5304822 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5304823 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5304824 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5304825 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5304826 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5304827 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5304828 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5304829 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5304830 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5304831 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5304832 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5304833 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5304838 the c ram initiative at jrtc has made significant strides in improving the force protection training for army brigade combat teams bcts as they prepare for eventual deployments to iraq and afghanistan
5304839 the great training that jrtc and the c ram program office provides here will continue to lay the foundation for success this training provides the maneuver commander with another tool to defeat the perimeter threat that we see today in theater
5304840 ibdsos provides the fob commander with an integrated set of capabilities that is designed to protect against and defeat perimeter threats
5304841 ibdsos is an integral part of c ram and provides the ground commander with additional capabilities to help defeat the insurgent threat and prevent loss of life
5304842 the ibdsos training that weve received here has been outstanding
5304843 our ability to immediately get eyes on a potential threat allows us to provide immediate early warning of a potential attack to personnel on the fob and that helps us save lives
5304844 fully integrating joint fires and jisr assets into ibdsos training at jrtc will help prepare units for what theyll experience in theater
5304845 eventually we will digitally integrate ibdsos and c ram system information with joint fires and command and control systems that will greatly improve shared situational awareness among coalition forces and make it easier to defeat fob threats our ability to integrate joint assets with our own fires capabilities cuts down on the time to gain a positive identification on a threat and that helps us to respond quickly and appropriately
5304846 ibdsos provides us with a mission essential capability that will give our unit an unprecedented level of force protection once we deploy in theater ibdsos training is another opportunity for bcts to receive realistic and rigorous training that prepares them for their next mission

5304858 the dollars continuing uptrend is a key factor depressing commodities in general and triggering heavy sales in gold
5304859 inflation will restrict the feds ability to cut rates plus we have weaker growth in europe so the euro has been suffering
5304860 the dollar is coming out top at the moment so people have been liquidating commodities
5304861 not surprisingly the dollar is stronger and weighing on the commodity complex at large
5304862 with the rest of the world now joining the u s in slowing down the prospects for holding the dollar have brightened considerably
5304863 theres a perception that demand for commodities might be weakening

5304866 si nuestras abejas entran en contacto con el ma z gen ticamente modificado y la miel se contamina con l no nos permitir n venderla
5304867 es bien sabido que las abejas pasan 90 por ciento de su tiempo de vida en un per metro de tres kil metros pero pueden volar hasta 10 kil metros sin problema estamos realmente felices de que la ciudad de munich les haya dado asilo a nuestras abejas

5304869 pero en algunas regiones como en brandenburgo alrededor de berl n es casi imposible escapar a los transg nicos est n por todos lados y las abejas entran en contacto con ellos
5304870 tras algunas buenas semanas en la primavera las abejas se ven amenazadas por la hambruna porque avanzado el a o casi no quedan flores
5304871 en vastas regiones especialmente en la zona oriental del pa s no hay nada que sirva de alimento a las abejas
5304872 encontramos en sus cuerpos abundantes trazas de ese qu mico
5304873 porque las reas verdes recreativas y los jardines tienen una vegetaci n variada y exuberante que florece a lo largo de varios meses desde principios de la primavera hasta el fin del verano
5304874 en las ciudades las abejas s lo deben volar unos pocos cientos de metros de un parque p blico a un balc n y de all a un jard n para encontrar suculentas flores en su mayor a libres de insecticidas

5304884 ya hay signos visibles suicidios por pobreza desempleo desesperaci n anarqu a y padres que matan a sus propios hijos por no poder alimentarios no estoy exagerando
5304885 eso ha sucedido varias veces en la historia en diferentes partes del mundo y por las mismas causas el hambre es una forma de violencia real y angustiante
5304886 tarde o temprano la gente reaccionar espero que no llegue a tanto pero la crueldad la codicia y la sangre fr a de muchos de nuestros pol ticos desaf a nuestra imaginaci n
5304887 no s lo explot descaradamente a esa regi n sino que la mat de hambre

5304889 no hay mucho que hacer ante el alza de precios en los mercados internacionales
5304890 la inflaci n es un proceso natural y necesario mediante el cual el alza de precios en el mundo se refleja en la econom a local
5304891 mantener controlados algunos sectores particulares de la econom a en especial el de alimentos b sicos para contener la escasez y la escalada de precios en el mbito local proteger a los m s vulnerables mediante alg n tipo de subsidios y favorecer la afluencia de capital extranjero
5304892 eso aliviar la presi n que ejercen los factores externos y permitir que la rupia se estabilice y por consiguiente reducir algunas de las consecuencias de la inflaci n importada

5304896 such was the deluge that it was greater than anyone expected
5304897 obviously theres a very serious failing when flash flooding is able to close that junction and fill up that underpass with water
5304898 we will need to ascertain what happened and make sure it doesnt happen again
5304899 this has been a terrible weekend for many families who have seen their homes badly affected by flooding
5304900 only those who know the misery of such a situation can rightly imagine the stress and worry that these families are experiencing
5304901 they now need practical help advice and support to re establish their homes and normal life
5304902 i have been in contact with colleagues in the executive and we are in agreement that funding should be made available through local councils to help people most severely affected to get back on their feet again and to assist them in ensuring their homes are habitable

5304908 it is with great sadness that the ministry of defence must confirm that a soldier from 2nd battalion the royal regiment of scotland attached to 1st battalion the royal irish regiment was killed in afghanistan today monday 18 august 2008
5304909 at 8 25am local time a joint afghan national army and uk operational mentoring liaison team were patrolling when they dismounted in the region of forward operating base attal in the gereshk area of helmand province
5304910 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
5304911 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
5304912 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
5304913 mostly that 20 percent drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
5304914 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
5304915 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customization options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
5304916 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old e mail service
5304917 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
5304918 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better
5304919 arka das 14 wanted his classmate sagar doluis i pod he asked sagars sister siuli 9 to come to him with the i pod at tilpara barrage a reservoir over mayurakshi river seven km from siuri on sunday evening so that he could click photographs of her when the girl reached the spot he snatched the i pod from her and pushed her off the barrage
5304920 i told siuli to hand me the i pod when she refused i snatched it from her and threw her down the barrage
5304921 but when i saw that siuli had fallen on the bank of the river instead of the water and was alive i was scared that she will tell the elders so first i tried to choke her to death and then smashed her head with a stone
5304922 arka said siuli had gone with him for a walk down the mayurakshi river but while returning home parted way saying she has some important work to do hearing that her parents filed a missing complaint at siuri police station late sunday night

5304932 dan provides extraordinary strategic market and product leadership and is uniquely qualified to guide the company through this challenging operating environment
5304933 and it wasnt challenged by much of the press because it told them what they wanted to hear
5304934 close agreement on the violent death toll for the first 17 months
5304935 yes l1s midrange estimate excluding fallujah is really quite plausible
5304936 of iraqi war deaths rest on the data provided by lafta who operated with little american supervision and has rarely appeared in public or been interviewed about his role
5304937 has anyone in the neighborhood died in the last couple years especially violently
5304938 consider the following scenario the l2 interviewers for whatever reason decide that they want to report more deaths
5304939 consider l2 interviewers for whatever reason decide that they want to report more deaths
5304940 the debate here is whether or not demographic household data specifically the ages of each member of the household was collected
5304941 consider the following scenario the l2 interviewers for whatever reason decide that they want to report more deaths
5304942 when i said age and sex data were not collected i really only meant age and hey its your fault if you assumed i meant both and since you never asked me specifically i was under no obligation to clarify the statement
5304943 i seriously hope that some more of your david kanes academic colleagues finally to comment on this behaviour of yours
5304944 i am sorry if luna has not been following the debate as closely as say donald johnson
5304945 thus far it looks to me as though iraqi ministry of health data were used to estimate that statistic thus making
5304946 ben neither of the events you mentioned occurred in 2002 so no they dont show up in either the lancet papers or this njem paper
5304947 the nejm does have a much bigger sample size than either lancet study 9345 households in 1086 clusters versus 1849 households in 50 clusters
5304948 uncertainty in the missing cluster adjustment factors was difficult to quantify since we assumed that the excess risk of mortality in missing clusters in baghdad and anbar was normally distributed with standard deviations of 0 2 and 0 1 respectively
5304949 i claim that they still matter when judging the good bad of the invasion based on the body count
5304950 was there a reasonable likelihood that hed commit more atrocities in the future
5304951 was the alternative better or worse and not just in terms of the body count
5304952 the wheels of science grind slowly but they grind very fine indeed if the data underlying l1 l2 is fake then the lancet papers will be the most important scientific fraud of the decade think that is impossible think again what can the crooked timber community do act like scholars and scientists as kieran does in this post keep an open mind consider all the evidence look at the underlying data study the statistical models replicate the results make our findings public
5304953 the position taken is seemingly an innocent one that we do not know enough to know what the facts of history were and rather than condemning anyone we should await the ultimate decision of research this is a manipulative misuse of the valued principle in science that facts must be proven before they are accepted in order to obfuscate facts that are indeed known and to confuse the minds of fair minded people who do not want to fall prey to myths and propaganda the very purpose of science which is to know is invoked in order to justify a form of know nothingness
5304954 furthermore ben the figures youre claiming for the deaths in the anfal campaign and the shia uprising have never been proven to anything like the degree of accuracy of the post invasion deaths
5304955 oh and ben your earlier comment about how youd rather die than live under saddam would you rather watch as your father was hung on a meat hook after electroshock torture and your wife and mother were pack raped to death than live under saddam
5304956 ian thats the kind of thing that happened under saddam
5304957 with the implication that if america had to kill a few hundred thousand of them doing what they were to cowardly to do for themselves tough noogies
5304958 yeah well stomp saddam but people youre close to and honestly maybe you as well might die in the process
5304959 and yet l1 without the fallujah data seems to be in close agreement with this new study
5304960 donald johnson insists that and yet l1 without the fallujah data seems to be in close agreement with this new study back of the envelope that seems true note that i have not closely read the ifhs paper and first pass i am not sure how you remove falluja from its sample to compare it to an l1 sample without falluja but anyway does that admission make you happy
5304961 lafta managed the field survey in iraq participated in the study design and the analysis interpretation and preparation of the manuscript
5304962 tone is unacceptable the facts are shoddy and the ideas are not endorsed by myself the other authors on the sidebar or the harvard iqss
5304963 the rates and time trends of violent deaths differed considerably among the three sources table 4
5304964 if doocy says that age wasnt collected for all householders can we clarify who age was collected for i want to know what the heck it was that i saw
5304965 many families were convinced by team members and supervisors to answer the questionnaire after repeated trials with the help of members of the local community
5304966 the ifhs website also reports that aggressive efforts were made to obtain responses from reluctant families
5304967 most families in the sample cohort welcomed the field teams but some families were afraid to respond to the interviewers others refused to answer however many families were convinced by team members and supervisors to answer the questionnaire after repeated trials with the help of members of the local community

5305130 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5305131 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5305132 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5305133 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5305134 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5305135 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5305136 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5305137 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5305151 youre either a cheater or you breakup and im not the first im the second one and thats it theres no lying theres no bulls i just dont want to be followed around new york city like an animal
5305152 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks

5305189 but it is not uncommon in this sport to compete with three members
5305190 we have two really good quarterbacks that are really good people so we have a good problem im not sure we would have won the acc championship last year without both of them
5305191 thats a compliment to our program that we can lose 13 guys to the nfl and still be picked to win
5305192 everythings got to take a little bit of a cut
5305193 this is a year that we are in trouble weve got to set a fundamental structure for next year for the years that follow so that we can balance the books here
5305194 well see what the number is but in principle you know we need to spread the pain and if member items are part of that pain i think thats something we can accept
5305195 losing donald is a tough loss for the football team when you lose your most experienced and best receiver coming back it certainly hurts you especially when you are trying to find a quarterback
5305196 theyre about as green as the quarterbacks with the exception of senior daniel evans
5305197 it s a situation that is a work in progress some of those kids have to step up and make some plays
5305198 we are still trying to find the best five guys and also find some guys who can go in and spell them so they wont have to play 82 plays or 75 plays a game well be better in the long run for that
5305199 stephen hauschka was a great kicker and i loved watching him kick just being around him and john deraney was huge for me because they were both so successful it puts the idea in your head i was waiting behind two nfl guys i am eager to fill their shoes and get my shot

5305216 the cartoonists doing well in portland have some kind of stable job which theyre terrified to lose or theyre able to support themselves entirely off their comics
5305217 i needed a day job to support myself and make some money that never came i applied for over 100 jobs three temp jobs several comic companies nothing ever came not a thing not even a gas station job portland may be cheaper than new york but if you cant find work it doesnt matter how cheap it is it may be a boom town but when everyone is clinging to every craft job they have theres no turn around

5305221 if you intend to make comics on your own you must learn skills whether or not theyre your favorite part of the art form

5305242 my nightmare is 12 soccer moms on a jury trying to understand rules of engagement hostile intent and all the other things that confront a marine in combat
5305243 in reality the situation was far from the calm organized environment the government prosecutors apparently intend to present to the oblivious civilian jury the fighting was so fierce that the 3rd battalion 1st marine regiment battalion aid station received 197 combat casualties out of the 1 250 man reinforced battalion during the first 96 hours according to marine corps records

5305246 traveling around town sacramento area my 3g coverage changes dramatically from 1 bar to full bars not sure if its working properly or not

5305270 innography has developed a compelling product that gives organizations an insightful strategic view of the ip landscape for capitalizing on growth and revenue opportunities
5305271 we believe innography is extremely well positioned for long term success as they simultaneously enable their customers to do the very same
5305272 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry
5305273 we believe our second quarter sales benefited from the economic impact of the fiscal stimulus tax rebates unfortunately weakness in bigger ticket projects continues particularly in markets most impacted by the housing downturn
5305274 the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent
5305275 we remain focused on positioning the company for long term success while managing through the near term challenges of the current environment

5305284 the emphasis today is on reducing costs through infrastructure and technology
5305285 many companies are engaged on three five or 10 year projects

5305287 three years ago 70 of our developers were working in java and 30 in microsoft now it is 65 at least in net
5305288 there is a unix skills shortage because most unix developers are mature and will disappear soon this is a challenge getting graduates to move into old technology is impossible

5305297 because i work for an internet company i quickly realised that a lot of the western media misunderstood the protests in tibet i have travelled in tibet and day to day life there is peaceful and calm when there were free tibet demonstrations during the olympic torch relay in paris and london i was terribly angry about it especially when i read how the western media were reporting it but i did not know how to express my anger we chinese learn at a young age not to show our emotions so we wear these clothes to express our feelings
5305298 the red heart symbolises love and red stands for our country we wear it to show our patriotic feelings
5305299 at the moment nationalism is fairly strong because of a number of things that have happened
5305300 the riots in tibet as well as the earthquake in sichuan and of course the olympic games but what has really fanned the flames of nationalism is the western medias reporting on tibet
5305301 i am a big fan of president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao
5305302 we are currently heading in the right direction since the 1978 reforms began in day to day life you can see we are better off we have no reason to complain
5305303 they lean in and put their faces in the mist and then theyll turn around and back their rumps up to the fans
5305304 youd think that horses would be spooked at going in the tents because they seem a bit like a wind tunnel when the fans are on but thats not the case at all
5305305 eight belles made the industry wake up and take notice of its problems
5305306 we are not recommending reforms to appease people we are making them because we need to make them
5305307 there will be additional recommendations forthcoming but i dont have a timeline
5305308 even the best labs dont have the resources to do the testing needed
5305309 were spending the same amount as we did 20 years ago our system worked decades ago but it wont work now
5305310 everyone in this room is a steward of a national treasure
5305311 i am willing to drop everything im doing to make these recommendations a reality
5305312 there werent many new ideas here today and the main issue has not been addressed
5305313 i would challenge the industry to match the money now spent on drug testing there is no beef wheres the beef
5305314 in clinical work the voice is often one of the first things you notice in depressed patients
5305315 i can tell with my patients on the phone sometimes after only a few words how they are going you can hear a flatness a tension coming through the voice changes very dramatically when they are depressed
5305316 the heavy rain over the weekend has made conditions very difficult
5305317 the slippery conditions meant many of the incidents dealt with were slips trips and falls though there were also reports of staff dealing with bee stings blisters and people who had forgotten medication
5305318 overall it has been a very successful operation with the vast majority of festival goers taking heed of the warnings about coming prepared had they not done so we could well have had many more casualties to deal with

5305323 you know how when you see a rock split open sometimes and its really beautiful inside theres crystals and colors and all kinds of stuff in the middle
5305324 you see mama when you look at a rock you have to believe that it has all that beautiful stuff inside you cant see it but you just know that its there just like you know that god is there inside
5305325 it is no different from stealing another persons shoes or stereo except sometimes it can be a lot more damaging
5305326 what were his supervisor branch manager assistant director and non merit director doing while hayes was allegedly producing and selling 68 dvds
5305327 if we define entropy in its strict sense it is used in physics to describe the lack of energy within a system the breakdown of complex forms to less organized forms leading to a state of utter disorganization and lack of energy the psychological equivalent of that would be the run down of fairly complex psychological states of existence into depression despair inertia melancholia etc i dont see my work reflecting that either on a physical or psychological level quite the opposite its a misreading to assume that because my work is populated by abandoned hotels drained swimming pools empty night clubs deserted airfields and the like that i am celebrating the rundown of a previous psychological and social order i am not what i am interested in doing is using these materials as the building blocks of a new order
5305328 the length of time for reviews impacts all pharmaceutical companies
5305329 the more people you can get to analyze the clinical data at the fda the better it should make the process become much faster
5305330 this process has served us well in the past but it is slow laborious and fraught with failure and most importantly exposes thousands of patients to drugs and medical devices before they are proven to be safe and effective
5305331 as the fda continues to face new challenges protecting our nations food and drug supply it is important that congress provide them with the resources they need
5305332 i dont care who it is after 33 years of something you need a change
5305333 and i needed a change ive welcomed it my enthusiasm is there my energy is there and working with patti and trip is going to be terrific
5305334 i dreamed i was going to make a chair then i got the idea to carve the chair out of a tree
5305335 we were deeply inspired by the forest itself where the engineers tested the designs for the delta works a series of dams sluices locks dikes and storm surge barriers built to protect the southwest netherlands from high water now that dutch engineers are busy elevating the dikes again because the sea level is rising we thought it would be nice to offer an artistic solution they measure for real but with art its often difficult to measure its the beauty that touches you and it can be absurd too
5305336 if you manage nature in the netherlands you also manage its culture because there isnt a square metre of this country that hasnt been touched by human hands and here in this location people can enjoy a pleasant stroll among trees and water as well as a look at a part of our history what more could you want
5305337 what weve realised is that we need to offer a mix of culture and nature its such a mix that makes the areas we look after so special and were trying to develop these locations so that both aspects are shown to their best advantage
5305338 biomedical research institutions and universities are certainly struggling with the implications of reduced nih funding
5305339 when funding is scarce research can be stalled and the benefits to society are delayed
5305340 many researchers vying for the same limited funding makes the competition extremely tough particularly for new investigators attempting to get their research agendas moving forward limited funding means that excellent research with wide reaching impacts may not receive adequate financial support simply because money runs out before an agency like the nih can fund all of the worthy projects
5305341 this kind of pressure from nih has increased that number
5305342 its putting an additional burden on the university to support researchers that were being supported by federal funding

5305367 theres no better place than an amusement park to confront horror and things were fearful of
5305368 the fact that it took place near roller coasters and cotton candy sends an important message we here can engage in frivolity and fun at a time when in our name this is happening to people somewhere else
5305369 the idea behind this is the person is sucking in a little bit of water and a lot of air so they feel like theyre drowning the real power of the interrogator is the fear of the unknown
5305370 but i think if youre for or against this technique the conversation about this needs to start we need to recognize what it truly is which is torture
5305371 we are reaching a group of people that dont know about the subject
5305372 thats real wrong to torture someone and i wouldnt have put a dollar in if i knew
5305373 i dont think theres a need for that i dont like it

5305391 well behaved dogs and responsible owners are always welcome at dinton pastures and its fantastic news that dinton has been nominated as one of the best places to exercise pets
5305392 however as dinton is a much loved and so very well used site there are many people spending time there on a day to day basis so its important for all dog walkers to make sure their animals are under control and that any dog mess is cleared up
5305393 i really do hope dinton makes it into the 21 best places for dog walking in the country as it is a superb park with lots of grass wildlife and water features which makes it a great facility for dogs and their owners
5305394 i would remind all dog owners however to use the park responsibly by controlling their pets where necessary especially around wildlife and other park users and picking up any dog mess so that everyone can continue to enjoy dinton pastures

5305404 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5305440 con un jugador menos se nos complic demasiado el partido me voy caliente por eso porque todo lo que trabajamos durante la semana y el esfuerzo de tantos d as se termina echando por la borda por los errores arbitrales pero bueno ya est no por criticar al rbitro nos van a devolver los tres puntos que est bamos ganando con total justicia cuando paulo marc el gol de penal as que tenemos que olvidarnos r pidamente de esto

5305448 some commissioners have argued that the relative value units of the physician fee schedule should be at least partly based on a services value to medicare for example if analysis of clinical effectiveness for a given condition were to show that one service were superior to an alternative service for a given condition then medicares process of setting relative values might reflect that this process would be a departure from the established method of setting relative values based only on the time mental effort technical skill and effort psychological stress and risk of performing the service

5305460 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5305461 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5305462 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5305481 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5305482 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5305483 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5305484 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5305485 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5305486 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5305487 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action

5305499 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5305500 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5305501 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

5305504 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5305505 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

5305508 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5305509 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5305510 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5305511 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5305512 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5305525 it would be nice if an african team can win it but there are other teams in this tournament south americans as well so its going to be tough really tough
5305526 weve worked really hard the past couple of years to qualify for this and to finally get here to finally get to the semifinal it would be really disappointing to go home with nothing

5305549 theyve got a very good centre back pairing a very competent goalie behind them and harper sitting just in front of them so theyve got an edge about themselves

5305563 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5305564 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5305565 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5305566 in other words they are a crucial cog in the economic wheel allowing many homes to earn an additional income yet they remain poorly paid and face multiple discriminations
5305567 between 1999 and 2005 at least 147 migrant domestic workers died from workplace accidents or suicide most by jumping or falling from residential buildings there is no single reason why domestic workers resort to suicide but research by human rights watch suggests that many women are made despondent by poor working conditions anxiety about debts owed to employment agencies social isolation and prolonged confinement indoors sometimes for weeks at a time in many cases migrant domestic workers in singapore work thirteen to nineteen hours a day seven days a week and are restricted from leaving the workplace they typically earn less than half the pay that workers earn in similar occupations in singapore such as gardening and cleaning and are forced to relinquish the first four to ten months of their salaries to repay employment agency fees in the worst cases manipulated by agents or employers or both migrant domestic workers suffer under conditions amounting to forced labour
5305568 domestic workers at risk of rights violations during recruitment placement and employment are often in situations that prevent them from reporting abuses
5305569 the lack of reporting mechanisms the private nature of work the lack of legal protections and restrictions on freedom of movement of domestic workers
5305570 in 2000 a domestic worker was able to repay the loan to her employers with the first six months of her salary but today the repayment term has grown to 8 10 months that makes a big hole in the workers earnings from a first two year contract term at least one third of her salary is lost before her family sees a cent of it
5305571 there is no need at this point to legislate a mandatory rest day but that the ministry of manpower encourages employers to grant rest days regularly wherever possible

5305577 they tied jim effectively to the problems in washington and tied him to the anti d c sentiment which is very powerful in the republican party
5305578 her underlying message was that he was from washington his time had passed and she was a new face
5305579 in the current political environment dont underestimate the current anti d c sentiment that might be the major lesson learned here
5305580 she waited until people were paying attention and she drove her message home
5305581 most people are not paying attention and are not engaged at all
5305582 it was pretty gutsy she really waited until the end
5305583 if you wait until the very end you might bring home some voters and they did
5305584 it caused people in washington to think she was a bad campaigner
5305585 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this tornado and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed

5305588 improving the utilization of woody biomass from both rural forests and urban landscapes is a promising arena in the pursuit of a viable alternative to fossil fuels
5305589 by tapping into currently unused sources such as wood waste typically left after harvesting operations trees and branches removed in urban areas and demolition debris from construction sites we can expand renewable energy sources in virginia
5305590 if your neighbor is doing everything right and youre not youre hurting yourself and him everyone needs to properly manage this pest
5305591 if you call me or your county extension agent and you have a 2 inch palmer amaranth we might can help you
5305592 but if you call when the palmer amaranth is 20 to 24 inches high get your shovel and start digging it up because theres no way you can manage it with a pesticide
5305593 if you think you can run roundup ready programs and just put everything down at planting then this pest will put you out of cotton production without a doubt
5305594 residual based programs must be used throughout the season we dont even want to see a pigweed thats the only we can truly manage this pest economically
5305595 most of these failures are in dryland fields where residual herbicides were not activated in a timely manner or in conservation tillage fields where the residual herbicides did not reach the soil regardless each of these growers faces some very difficult management challenges for the rest of 2008 management options include herbicides cultivation and or hand weeding
5305596 although most growers remember the days of cultivation it is critical to remove the root from the soil while trying to avoid cultivating within 72 hours of a rainfall as the plant would re root itself it is also worth mentioning that the cultivation process will stimulate a new flush of weeds that will have to be managed in the next couple of weeks also of course cultivation does not provide control in the row where yield loss is the greatest
5305597 if a palmer amaranth plant is cut off above ground it will re grow and likely be very green and aggressively growing at the time of defoliation and harvest not to mention seed production still will be enormous
5305598 from wetlands to sandhills the ordway swisher biological station spans one of the rarest collections of imperiled land types in the nation a precious rarity that makes it the perfect laboratory for measuring the effects of environmental change
5305599 this transfer represents an important step in tncs relationship with uf and the station
5305600 this paves the way for a number of collaborative projects that build on both ufs and tncs goals and is an important milestone in the stations path to becoming a globally significant research and education site
5305601 near paranoid in their fear for their own farmers livelihoods should they import a glut of imported american and european food that is a product of sophisticated economies of scale
5305602 true there are more corporate farms now but most of these corporations are family corporations where the father is ceo and all the officers are family members
5305603 the family operated 40 acre farm passed long ago because of intense economic pressure
5305604 profit margins in agriculture are so small it takes a large farm to support a family
5305605 they got big because theyre good at what they do they produce large amounts at low prices
5305606 if thats what we have to do if we have to reward big farmers to produce cheap food for the worlds poor then this may be the lesser of two evils
5305607 youve got to have seed and fertilizer suppliers sufficient and good land to grow the crops not to mention help to go into farming such as loan programs to get aspiring farmers started

5305626 the fact that firms continue to reduce planned growth in capital investment staff development and employment is particularly troubling since it suggests that the slowdown could have long term implications
5305627 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions
5305628 although real activity is weak we also are simultaneously experiencing bad news on the inflation front in the form of higher energy and commodity prices this creates the challenge of facilitating the economys return toward more favorable growth rates without igniting greater inflationary pressures
5305629 the financial turmoil and subsequent tightening of credit conditions add another dimension of difficulty to the problem
5305630 added layers of complexity to the management of monetary policy
5305631 st lucie county has not diversified as well as it wants to so a lot of the community is still based on residential with the slowdown in construction that trickles down

5305635 theres not much to choose between them rio ferdinand john terry gareth barry gerrard lampard ashley cole there are players there that have captained sides but rest assured whoever does the job the lads will get behind
5305636 its important players motivate themselves john terry is a great captain as is rio ferdinand as is beckham but you have to get the best out of yourselves first and foremost
5305637 were all together were all in spirits positive about the qual campaign cant wait to get started
5305638 the responsibility for the failed campaign falls at the feet of the players we need to remedy this by getting three points on the board against andorra well get there

5305641 there are many factors that win a football game whether they are technical tactical mental or physical you gotta keep moving forward in every department the people in charge of the game are moving forward and the lads in the dressing room want to move on
5305642 it was a set back not being in the european championship of course it was youre only as good as your last game you take your disappointments you cant cry over spilt milk you just keep ploughing on were going in the right direction the world cup is the next challenge

5305645 time is precious in international football were learning more from how he wants us to play i could go into tactics but there is a long list we re improving the tactics change with every game
5305646 let us please the lord as soldiers please their king because we are required to give an exact account of our service after the campaign let us fear the lord no less than we fear beasts for i have seen men who were going to steal and were not afraid of god but hearing barking dogs they at once turned back and what the fear of god could not achieve was done by the fear of animals let us love god at least as much as we respect our friends for i have often seen people who had offended god and were not in the least perturbed about it and i have seen how those same people provoked their friends in some trifling matter and then employed every artifice every device every sacrifice every apology both personally and through friends and relatives not sparing gifts in order to regain their former love

5305649 the economy keeps getting worse and people just dont have the extra money

5305655 we need more high school and college graduates to be competitive with the world market
5305656 education is the key to economic development that is the greatest resource we can have
5305657 the category that has taken the biggest hit is the small mom and pop type tenants
5305658 as minimum wage goes up that is going to ratchet up all other wages to stay competitive
5305659 for it to work more effectively there has to be more additions
5305660 weve got to have more people living downtown and more activities to draw people to downtown so you have customer residing in the area as well as customer attracted to the area

5305665 all it takes is for the right leader to tell them the right thing and they will support it
5305666 my interest in motorcycles began in 1946 when as a teenaged gwen wickham i cheered on my heroes every week at wembley speedway a few years later after my family moved from north london to southampton i met jack white a great character who taught me to ride a motorcycle became my best friend and eventually in 1958 my husband although he was 24 years my senior jackie white was a well known member of the ariel works trials team just before the war and he encouraged me to ride in trials with him my first trial was the sunbeam mccs novice trial in 1950 on jacks flying flea royal enfield another competitor that day was mike jacksons elder brother john who at 17 was also competing for the first time jack then prepared a 125cc bsa bantam for me which i rode in open to centre trials most sundays and a few nationals when i could get a saturday off from my job as a hospital laboratory technician in 1952 i progressed to a 197cc francis barnett and rode it in that years scottish six days trial along with jack who had a similar bike he had modified them by fitting friction dampers to the forks and had altered the steering head angle which made them handle well unfortunately jacks bike developed ignition trouble and he had to retire on the wednesday bu mine carried me to the finish without missing a beat the scottish was an adventure and experience that i shall never forget and i was lucky enough to ride in it again in 1957 this time on a 197cc james commando incidentally the previous owner was john jackson he and mike were fellow southampton club members and were by then very successful trial and moto cross riders the james went well until mid week when during a downhill tumble the frame got twisted and i suffered with chain trouble for the rest of the trial i managed to finish but with a large loss of marks i rode francis barnett until 1955 and then the james in some of the other nationals including the west of england the welsh two days beggars roost cotswold cups trial the hoad trial and the perce simon trial the latter being close to home for me and in those days run on the new forest what i loved most about trials was the fun camaraderie and challenge all in beautiful surroundings to which one would never normally have access on a standard road vehicle although most of us in those days rode the same bike to work each day pic shows gwen at rest during the west of england trial in devon 1952 photo and lemonade courtesy mr huntley francis barnett rep jack and i were married in 1958 and we set up home together when our two daughters came along i gave up competition riding but still rode a bike on the road i also rode the odd vintage bike including jacks 1930 ariel 250cc colt pictured in a few club runs sadly jack died in 1977 but i still have that battered up old ariel on which he won so much including third place in the 1934 scottish six days photo shows gwen riding the ariel at a vintage club run in 1995 despite advice to the contrary i refuse to have it restored to remove all its battle scars and jacks modifications would rob it of its considerable character i have never lost my love of motorcycling which these days i enjoy as a spectator along with the great friendships which have survived the years

5305717 for the longest time i could not remember the name of this store
5305718 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
5305719 since id is not science the conclusion is inescapable that the only real effect of the id policy is the advancement of religion
5305720 does changing the definition of science solve the establishment clause problem for teaching intelligent designs as science in public schools doing an end run around the constitution
5305721 it is now generally well accepted that creation science is religion and has been discredited as a scientific theory
5305722 the theory of intelligent design is simply an effort to empirically detect whether the apparent design in nature acknowledged by virtually all biologists is genuine design the product of an intelligent cause or is simply the product of an undirected process such as natural selection acting on random variations
5305723 if id proponents want id to be taught as science they must present a falsifiable predictive theory about the origins of life and then obtain scientific acceptance of the design inference
5305724 first it must establish itself as science second it must disentangle itself from religion
5305725 if the scientific method is taught correctly there is no confusion in presenting evolution as the dominant scientific theory and there would be no confusion that evolutionary theories are anything but absolute
5305726 leading proponents of darwinian evolution frequently raise the cultural and metaphysical implications of the theory in their writings
5305727 judge jones set forth a double standard by considering how design proponents have interpreted id within the context of their own religious beliefs but ignored the fact that evolutionists have done precisely the same thing by interpreting evolution within the context of their religious or anti religious beliefs not only does this represent a non neutral treatment of theistic religious motives versus anti theistic religious motives but it proposes a rule which if applied consistently could even threaten the teaching of evolution
5305728 while lumping id with creationism may be a good rhetorical strategy for ids opponents it only detracts from an independent and rigorous evaluation of the merits of ids claims perhaps the most ironic aspect of this debate is that darwinists are even opposed to the inclusion of id in the public school curriculum if there is any fundamental tenet of darwinism is it not that competition leads inexorably to progress
5305729 the whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want rain without thunder and lightning they want the ocean without the awful roar of its waters
5305730 find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them

5305775 as a parish council we are not unsympathetic to development
5305776 this is a large site and we understand that developers would want to build on it especially given the housing shortage
5305777 but that doesnt mean we are prepared to see a site flattened and concreted over

5305781 the council published its carriageway resurfacing programme 2008 9 and we were shocked to find that no streets in redlands would be resurfaced over the next 12 months this is the second year running that the council has overlooked streets in desperate need of repair in the ward
5305782 the road surface on these roads are pitted and full of potholes
5305783 residents have highlighted these problems and we have pressed the council to act

5305807 that humanist education did not create a national identity that superseded regional identity as has often been claimed but that national and regional identities were interwoven in those who attended humanist educational institutions
5305808 implicit in every culture is a theory of reality which motivates its ordering of that reality into good and bad right and wrong them and us and so on

5305840 in terms of acquiring these music titles it makes all the sense in the world
5305841 why go to outside writers for original music and producers when we have all the talent and material we need in house

5305844 doctors and patients need reliable unbiased information about the effectiveness of treatments to determine the best care possible but right now that data is scarce and unorganized
5305845 this bill will advance the process of reviewing and producing valuable information and making it available to health care providers and to all americans
5305846 patients and their doctors can make better decisions on treatment meaning we could lower costs and improve health care outcomes
5305847 as congress considers comparative effectiveness legislation we believe safeguards should be included to ensure that the final determination of what treatment option works best for each patient should be made by individuals and their physicians
5305848 it is also essential that research recognize the unique iterative nature of device innovation when establishing research priorities and conducting studies
5305849 supports the development and use of high quality evidence including comparative clinical effectiveness evidence for healthcare decision making proposals to expand government supported comparative clinical effectiveness research should be structured to promote better patient health and timely patient access to needed therapies and avoid denying or delaying patients access to beneficial care as what often occurs in europe and australia
5305850 to improve tomorrows healthcare coverage we need to change the incentives in todays healthcare system
5305851 will empower patients and providers by providing information on quality and value and improve safety and affordability of healthcare for everyone
5305852 senators baucus and conrad took an important step by introducing legislation to create an independent entity to give patients and their doctors the information they need to make health care decisions based on safety effectiveness and value we believe this is the right time for this proposal and pledge to work with the senators to advance comparative effectiveness legislation

5305884 de situatie op de kamermarkt is momenteel vergelijkbaar met die van vorig jaar momenteel zijn er in leuven net als vorig jaar op hetzelfde tijdstip nog een kleine 1 000 kamers beschikbaar eind september bleven er daarvan nog 200 a 300 over er is dus geen schaarste huurprijs de huurprijzen liggen onder meer daardoor slechts 3 4 procent hoger dan vorig jaar momenteel betaal je alle kosten inbegrepen gemiddeld 245 a 250 euro huur per maand

5305898 govern behaviour which is not licensable as it takes place outside
5305899 i imagine the licensing committee saw smoking outside as being inextricably linked with licensing activity so it felt it was fine to deal with the issue
5305900 although one licensing committees decision is not binding on another the fact that it has been publicised will undoubtedly lead to others doing the same sort of thing
5305901 this could well impact the pub trade further as people who would have previously popped in for a couple of pints and a few cigarettes might think twice

5305918 that 15 million bale export forecast gives us some cause for hope
5305919 even if we dont get to 15 million in exports it leaves us in the situation where we may see a tightening of the balance sheet for u s cotton
5305920 any number between 5 2 million and 7 1 million bales is still better than 10 million bales
5305921 the decline in world cotton production in 2008 09 is attributable mainly to the lower forecast for the united states as this crop is projected 28 percent below 2007 08
5305922 chinas crop is forecast only slightly below that of a year ago while the rest of the world of the world is forecast to fall 2 percent to the lowest since 2003 04
5305923 the u s share of global production is estimated lower at 12 percent in 2008 09 compared with the five year average of 18 5 percent
5305924 input costs for cotton are still high relative to other crops
5305925 the concern now is that when you look at these prices we could still be in a situation where we are still trying to hold on to cotton acres at best we may be holding on but we could possibly lose more acres in 2009
5305926 it may well be that consumers have to curtail clothing purchases because of higher gasoline prices
5305927 if you look at the august crop report over the last five years the crop gets bigger by from 1 million to 3 million bales between august and december
5305928 cotton still appears to be the better alternative because of the sharp increase in indias cotton yields
5305929 the key to the world production and price outlooks may be whether a shift will occur in brazil brazilian farmers are expected to plant more soybeans because of exchange problems and the higher prices offered for soybeans
5305930 while the long term outlook for the cotton sector in the united states is favorable the sector may still endure some pain

5305937 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5305947 het ligt namelijk niet aan de europese regelgeving maar aan de manier waarop de regels worden toegepast bestuurders moeten meer tijd nemen bij het aanbesteden en minder vaak de kortste weg kiezen

5305952 out of the 120 000 students who enrolled in higher education in 2000 36 000 3 0 dropped out in their first year of study and 24 000 more 20 dropped out during the second and third years
5305953 these figures form the backdrop in which teaching and learning programmes have to plan their strategies and interventions there are several other factors that should be considered
5305954 they carry the hope of family and community enter a new challenging environment with very little orientation and are faced with the demand that they adjust or fail
5305955 despite strenuous efforts by some trainers ngos and some universities schools do not focus on teaching academic language competence and even proficiency and fluency in english which is the main language of teaching and learning
5305956 some universities are exploring a four year degree structure and rethinking their courses in exciting ways the first response therefore is support in a context ready to consider and accept change

5305972 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title is finishing 12th and winning the league cup a successful season for us i dont think so you see the real quality of a team after 38 games in the league cup or the fa cup if you win five games you can be in the final does that tell you the real quality no because real quality only comes out in the championship if you dont win the league of course you are frustrated but the levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and two or three points is not a big gap we finished with 83 points last season and everywhere else in europe that would have made us champions

5305980 rising energy costs impact all sectors of our economy but agriculture producers in texas now have new opportunities to streamline operations reduce costs and remain competitive
5305981 to help farmers and ranchers face these significant challenges this program will identify incentives to move toward more energy efficient farms reducing energy costs increasing available capital spurring economic growth and improving the working environment
5305982 investing in our communities through improved energy efficiency in farming operations is a win win opportunity for state agriculture
5305983 we want to make texas made products available to every market in the world and we can keep prices competitive when farmers operate efficiently

5305985 it is hard to see ranchers selling off their entire herd cows that have been part of the ranch for generations they know these cattle by name they were part of the family not pets
5305986 as bad as it is i really saw a lot of great work being done by farmers to save the land
5305987 i also saw instances where conservation practices werent being used and saw the great damage being done above and beyond what mother nature has done
5305988 i really have to commend the farmers and ranchers out there for the conservation practices they have applied that is what makes this drought and the drought of the 1950s different than the dust bowl through the dust bowl experiences people learned how to take better care of the land and thats evident in a situation this severe
5305989 i wasnt expecting lake etling to be dry or the country to be so gray and dead
5305990 residue management is the biggest thing that has helped us out here
5305991 it has increased yields over time and we have better moisture management with less evaporation in those fields
5305992 the people around here learned their lessons in the dust bowl and the drought of the 1950s
5305993 they know it can get bad and they take care of the land year in and year out so when a drought does hit it helps protect their resources a little more
5305994 nearly everyone in the farming community around here has a conservation plan and tries very hard to follow those plans
5305995 the irrigated crops arent making it although farmers have watered and watered the high winds and heat are so excessive the water cant keep up with the evaporation rate

5306024 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5306025 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5306026 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5306027 the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5306028 and we will be clear about the essential nature of a new partnership between pakistan and afghanistan

5306103 it was long ago and far away in a prison camp in north vietnam my father was a high ranking admiral the vietnamese came and said that i could leave prison early and we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture i also had a dear and beloved friend who was from california by the name of ed alvarez who had been shot down and captured a couple years before me but i wasnt in good physical shape in fact i was in rather bad physical shape
5306104 so i said no now in interest of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so but i said no and ill never forget the high ranking officer who offered it slammed the door and the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was but it was not only the toughest decision i ever made but im most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life it took a lot of prayer it took a lot of prayer

5306121 medical aid fraud is certainly a big problem and it contributes to the overall cost of healthcare
5306122 theres a pot of money which members contributions are paid into apart from that there are two outflows administrative costs and claims paid
5306123 discovery spends roughly r10m a year on providing forensic services to medical schemes
5306124 its important to stress that even though the impact of fraud is considerable the majority of doctors do act in an ethical manner the fraud is mainly perpetrated by a small minority
5306125 its estimated that as much as 10 of the claims in the industry are fraudulent or abusive
5306126 but if you compare the rand amounts from year to year there will be an increase as more cases are being uncovered
5306127 i would like to believe that the awareness created over the last few years has actually brought down the amount of fraud in the industry
5306128 ultimately if it is averaged out there does not seem to be a sudden major increase in fraud

5306223 it is ridiculous that residents in these flats have been subjected to yet more flooding and inconvenience following the problems last year in which severe flooding occurred to the basement and the power was cut off for many hours leaving residents with no electric or heating
5306224 after the last incident i met with housing executive stressing the need for immediate action to be taken to help prevent a recurrence of the flooding experienced
5306225 one measure that is particularly needed is to move the switchgear and electric plant from the basement to a higher level so that even if there is flooding in the basement then the power supplies would not be affected

5306240 a couple of kids swam across and they started probing in the water trying to find her cause they couldnt see her
5306241 and when one kid finally found her they pulled her up on shore

5306247 this wealth position has been a mental driver of consumer strength over the past couple of years

5306250 we dont have an incentive for people to stay poor not zero sum their gains as they move up do not come at our expense china fear that they will catch up so we will fall behind untrue china has improved its standard of living is by selling us stuff they can make more cheaply than we can which is good for both of us chinas success increases our success improves our lives

5306253 recognising the fact the rate of our balance sheet growth is slower we have to work towards reducing the quantum or ratio of non performing assets that is the next step
5306254 it is not a significant change but a quiet manageable change
5306255 rising inflation interest rates have hit the affordability of consumer loans
5306256 in a falling interest rate regime it made sense to borrow from wholesale deposits and lend it to grow faster than the industry

5306289 we think its just not a good environment to introduce weapons into the crowded high occupancy area that a campus becomes
5306290 as someone who has served in law enforcement and has firearms training i dont think having students carrying guns on campus will make us a safer place

5306292 hopefully someday that means representing our independence from university funds
5306293 we are trying to create a model that can be grown without significant alternative sources of funding
5306294 there are good examples in town of schools that are very successful that raise a lot of money
5306295 but in order to be viable as a true growing enterprise as a public school you have to be able to operate and be successful with that level of funding
5306296 its compelling to keep growing when you stand and watch the lottery and see the reactions of families and kids who dont make the list
5306297 you realize that the odds of them receiving a similar education in the short term are relatively low and thats life changing for them
5306298 were doing a really lousy job getting a return on what were spending on education
5306299 so lets start measuring what kind of value were getting and figure out how we can do a better job of it
5306300 theres a little bit of reluctance among educators to say this is about money
5306301 they think about making a difference in the lives of students but theres a lot of money involved
5306302 we dont say its not right kids are not graduating from high school
5306303 what this is about is moving away from an era where the politics around schools and the decisions that have been made in school systems are all based on opinion and conjecture and not fact
5306304 we have to tackle this question of responsible funding and responsible use of funding
5306305 a lot of people think we should just be improving education as an end in itself
5306306 all too often the direct economic value generated by pastoralists is not retained in their communities and the indirect value is unrewarded and even unacknowledged by decision makers

5306374 to watch jason swim the fastest leg in history and make up a body length in the last 50 meters was just absolutely incredible
5306375 i had no idea where we were i mean i knew we were all together
5306376 i didnt know if i was ahead behind whatever and about 15 20 meters out i was focused on hitting the wall perfectly trying to have a good last stroke and i when i took that last stroke i thought that cost me the race
5306377 it was the perfect finish for a close race and definitely does not get any better than that
5306378 its just incredible to think about at a football game theyre showing a swimming race its cool to have that support to really hear about the sport growing
5306379 i was in the little hotel room sitting with two of my friends and i stood up and just didnt say anything
5306380 i was just proud of michael and how he handled himself through the whole thing
5306381 i wasnt surprised but id never seen him maintain that level of intensity through a whole program he can handle anything hes superman
5306382 i remember him sitting in indianapolis with hillary on one side and michael on the other side and both of them saying what happened mom why did this occur because michael saw his sisters as iconic you know they were the best
5306383 he was only 10 nothing should go wrong you know you put in a plan in place and it all should fall sequential i think it really gave michael a sense of reality it was something we all embraced and worked through
5306384 watching michael swim at 23 in beijing was like watching him swim at 10 back in baltimore
5306385 when michael was at that age he swam so far ahead of the field and now its like seeing the baby of the family coming on the platform of the world and performing the way he did when he was smaller

5306391 this actress recently reunited with her former flame for about a week of loving when each of their current relationships turned sour at about the same time after a week they realized why the hell they had broken up in the first place
5306392 despite the age difference this younger actress on the show came out to this older actress on the show and they had a love affair for about a year the older actress had been married but was not at the time of the romance the younger actress has never been married

5306399 las dudas surgen exactamente por las perspectivas futuras de todo los datos positivos que muestra la econom a
5306400 si la demanda sigue aumentando a un ritmo superior a la capacidad productiva habr menos crecimiento y crecer la inflaci n las reservas internacionales son elevadas pero est n para respaldar la base monetaria y el super vit fiscal podr a caer en 2009 cuando hay que enfrentar fuertes vencimientos de deuda
5306401 esas calificadoras a las que se les pas por las orejas el tema de las hipotecas en estados unidos quieren convencer a los argentinos de que estamos en problemas
5306402 no nos perdonan haber renegociado nuestra deuda como lo hicimos y haber recuperado decisi n luego de cancelar la deuda con el fondo monetario internacional fmi
5306403 en el caso argentino esa reducci n llega a casi 100 por ciento
5306404 en el estatal banco naci n hay un dep sito de m s de 30 000 millones de pesos unos 10 000 millones de d lares puede ser que ese sea el recurso extraordinario al que eche mano el gobierno en 2009 para recuperar deuda
5306405 deben pensar m s all del mantra contempor neo de la democracia las elecciones y la descentralizaci n
5306406 entre la promoci n de la reducci n de la pobreza y la promoci n de la democracia multipartidaria
5306407 la democracia produce gobiernos que son muy efectivos en la reducci n de la pobreza como lo muestra la reciente experiencia de brasil por ejemplo y hay reg menes menos democr ticos que tambi n han sido muy exitosos en este campo
5306408 la comunidad internacional debe reconocer que parte de esa efectividad puede responder a la naturaleza del r gimen
5306409 una fuerte conexi n entre el estado y los ciudadanos se ha forjado a trav s de un movimiento popular que genera un pacto social entre la elite y los pobres como parte de un proyecto de desarrollo nacional
5306410 china y vietnam son dos ejemplos y hubo otros en los ltimos 60 a os la comunidad internacional debe ejercer la cautela a la hora de agregar condicionamientos pol ticos a la ayuda u otras negociaciones internacionales por supuesto esto no significa que en casos extremos como el de zimbabwe no se adopte una firme posici n pol tica
5306411 debemos discutir este tema especialmente luego de acontecimientos traum ticos las autocracias pueden encarar proyectos de construcci n nacional m s efectivamente que los gobiernos electos la pol tica es m s que el recuento de votos
5306412 apuntalarlos debe ser tan importante para los donantes como abordar el cambio clim tico

5306463 nevertheless on august 21 2008 the state seeks to execute jeffery wood for the same crime even though the state does not contend that mr wood shot keeran in fact mr wood was not even in the building when reneau shot and killed keeran

5306520 musharraf continua a oferecer cobertura s opera es do talib mas ainda assim se provou capaz de convencer os norte americanos por muitos anos de que n o estava atuando com duplicidade
5306521 musharraf tentou construir um estado moderno e esclarecido disse tareen
5306522 mas provou que n o se pode de fato faz lo com uma estrutura na qual prevalece o compadrio e com uma m quina pol tica controlada pela pol cia

5306527 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5306528 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the us fully recognises this reality
5306529 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5306530 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5306531 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5306532 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5306533 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5306534 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5306535 given the passage of time we have to validate the assumptions used in the model to support our offer price of 25 74 per share in cash in addition we no longer believe we can integrate take two ahead of the important holiday season accordingly we require due diligence to support a transaction and are therefore letting the tender offer expire tonight however we are pleased to accept your offer to review your management presentation as outlined in your letter
5306536 we continue to have great respect for creative teams and products and are hopeful that we can work together to reach a mutually agreed transaction

5306538 since the start of the society in 1948 members have said how much photographic equipment and techniques have changed beyond recognition from those early years

5306550 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5306551 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5306552 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5306553 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5306554 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5306555 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5306556 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5306557 the paint on the american vampire league office in shreveport barely had time to dry before an angry mob gathered torches and stakes and charged the building

5306563 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
5306564 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
5306565 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
5306566 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
5306567 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
5306568 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
5306569 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
5306570 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters

5306574 jesse is a bigger than life personality and there is always an advantage of having a brand name like his attached to a show
5306575 that personality could especially work well in the court genre where he could break through in a crowded field needless to say it would be hard to confuse him with the other judges

5306577 maybe a nigerian born cyber virus wormed its way into the strib system and zapped everything using the word target or maybe this was what it walks like and quacks like an exercise in preemptive censorship designed to avoid offending a major source of revenue

5306587 as soon as we could stand we were on stage playing tambourine and hanging out at band rehearsals
5306588 my dad actually cautioned me against becoming a musician or ever dating one both of which i have blown on different occasions
5306589 ohio is the buckeye state and ohio sports fans give their heart to the college team unlike some states where college football isnt strong and professional sports are what matters
5306590 this may be due partially to the buckeyes being more successful than the pro franchises but the margin shows that it is more than just winning and losing
5306591 so the guy who played the dad in the brady bunch movie got married that isnt interesting
5306592 only the best athletes in the world can perform at this level playing more than one hour running and jumping on a complicated surface like the sand under strong wind heavy rain or the hottest conditions if they didnt like their uniforms the fivb would have received tons of complaints for them which is not the case

5306594 i picked my own ultimate trio i had the mini chicken ranchers the dynamite shrimp and the boneless buffalo wings ever since i was a little boy playing leap the sauerbraten on the streets of dresden i have always heard of these buffalo wings they were delicious i am very excited to try many other delicious foods that applebees has to offer
5306595 it was a big dinner and a long hot day at the site and i hadnt used the restroom all day
5306596 the restroom was wonderful there was plenty of toilet paper paper towels and a very impressive hand dryer and i could tell by the chart on the back of the door that todd and the rest of the management team at applebees check the cleanliness of the facility quite often i appreciated their leadership
5306597 there are so many other menu items that i now wish to try
5306598 ive heard great things about the pick n pair lunch combos the sizzling fajitas and the nachos huevos and if i dont have time to dine inside the restaurant i can utilize their carside to go service which i also hear is excellent of course if i do eat inside again i will be happy to know that an excellent restroom will be available great restaurants like applebees are but one reason that volkswagen is proud to now call chattanooga home
5306599 because it offered the richest deepest and most visually appealing of the sites we visited
5306600 not a single mention of the olympics on cbs sports mobile main page and nothing under its menus and categories only after clicking on more headlines did we pull up a few olympics related stories after searching specifically for olympics the site returned more than 100 links to news articles aggregated from various news outlets
5306601 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
5306602 almost regardless of what you assume about future immigration the country will be more hispanic and asian
5306603 people who say they are asian with their ranks soaring to 41 million from 16 million will make up more than 9 percent of the population up from 5 percent
5306604 you always get that generational shift but now theres a racial layer over it
5306605 irish catholics italians eastern europeans and even some germans who arrived in droves in the united states
5306606 i dont think a change such that the census category of non hispanic white becomes a minority in 30 years is so momentous
5306607 by then we may not even be using that census category and long before then people will be asking why asians are still considered a minority of any kind
5306608 take me to a place that cannot be of mountains tall and valleys deep
5306609 upset of the soviet union in 1980 is mistakenly remembered by many as that years gold medal game but thats only what it felt like the americans actually had to beat finland to claim their medal
5306610 although barack obama remains a slight favorite in this election his position is more vulnerable than at any point since the primaries concluded and he no longer appears to have a built in strength in the electoral college that we had attributed to him before
5306611 the fear is that the values and images of western mass culture like some invasive weed are threatening to choke out the worlds native flora
5306612 the right approach i think starts by taking individuals not nations tribes or
5306613 researchers have actually gone out into the world and explored the responses to the hit television series
5306614 and one thing theyve found is that how people respond to these cultural imports depends on their existing cultural context when the media scholar larry strelitz spoke to students from kwazulu natal he found that they were anything but passive vessels one of them sipho

5306622 although co problems are more common during the heating season vehicles including boats and some other fuel burning devices are used year round and can be sources of co in the home during any season parents should be aware that the home can pose potential risks on many levels and be aware of the warning signs
5306623 as far as general musharrafs crimes are concerned nawaz sharif has said that he has forgiven all the injustices against himself
5306624 but the crimes against the pakistani nation against pakistans judiciary against the rule of law and democracy in pakistan those cannot be forgiven by a person or a party
5306625 will have a positive effect on the strengthening of civilian government institutions and democracy in pakistan afghanistan hopes that pakistan has a stable democracy based upon the rule of law
5306626 musharrafs role was by the end of the day very ambivalent he was seen as the ally of the united states and a symbol of stability in the region but was he really such a symbol was he part of the problem or was he part of the solution
5306627 more and more observers came to the conclusion that musharraf himself was part of the problem therefore his resignation today signifies more confusion
5306628 but it will not necessarily lead this part of the world into immediate chaos he was part of the problem and part of the problem is resigning today
5306629 unfortunately the vision one has of pakistan right now is an extremely negative one
5306630 the future is very bleak the economic situation is confused the political situation is even more confused and the security situation is deteriorating so unfortunately it looks like a dark spot on the planet
5306631 i am pleased that musharraf has resigned it is pleasant news for our country we wanted deep in our hearts for him to go
5306632 i am very happy that the president has resigned it is good news for the safeguarding of the country because the situation had become very bad
5306633 and i hope god willing that the situation will improve after his resignation
5306634 until the afghan file has been transferred from pakistans army and intelligence to the foreign ministry in islamabad which is the civilian government we cannot say that the situation will improve in afghanistan as a result of musharrafs resignation
5306635 its very clear that we need to ensure that there are stringent reporting lines for civilian government oversight of the isi but youve got to do it the right way
5306636 there is a defense cabinet committee you have committees in the parliament in the senate etc that is the avenue available and part of the institutional assertion constitutional supremacy of the parliament means that the parliament also gets down to serious work and strengthens itself
5306637 so that issue remains there and is very crucial and important to pakistanis themselves
5306638 if he had stayed in power there would have been a crisis there would have been a campaign against him for impeachment his resignation was necessary at this moment in time
5306639 it is as if the flag of islam has been raised
5306640 musharraf was an idiot he was not the right person god knows whose agent he was the americans or someone else he didnt do anything good for us in the past five six even seven years
5306641 fool me once shame on you fool me again and ill fucking kill you
5306642 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
5306643 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
5306644 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields
5306645 quite frankly its how we should have been thinking for 10 years
5306646 we ended up opposing that amendment in retrospect i wish we hadnt
5306647 it was one of those cases where the public was ahead of the politicians
5306648 its absolutely essential that the state offer us something that makes it worth our while to be green
5306649 weve reached this critical point where were seeing the deployment of these technologies accelerate
5306650 there was slow progress over the last decade and youre now seeing this tipping point
5306651 it could have been done in a different way and things wouldnt have gotten so heated
5306652 its chicken little all over again the sky is going to fall
5306653 the oil and gas companies see the writing on the wall the shift to renewables they want to make as much money as they can right now

5306681 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
5306682 we looked at figures nationwide and we found that use of the therapy was extremely variable
5306683 basically a lot of people who should be getting the therapy arent and some of the people who are getting it may not need it
5306684 our findings parallel previous studies evaluating adoption of new medical technology in that they show racial disparity in who is receiving the newest therapies
5306685 in contrast to previous studies however we didnt find any gender gap in the use of crt
5306686 crt is an effective therapy for many patients and this study suggests clinically practice varies greatly compared to what it should be according to recommended guidelines
5306687 one of the most common behavioral changes cancer survivors make sometimes without a doctors advice often on their own is using dietary supplements in hopes of bolstering their health
5306688 still its unclear whether supplements really help keep cancer survivors healthier or put them at further risk they like many other people today use the internet and you can find a lot of false hope out there with supplements targeted at cancer survivors
5306689 in our study we see people taking supplements who have good diets and who are relatively healthy
5306690 while they may need a particular vitamin because they dont get enough of it they may not need a multivitamin or supplement because of the increased risk of cancer recurrence or a secondary cancer
5306691 its controversial but more research is pointing to not recommending supplements for cancer survivors because of the associated risk of the diseases return
5306692 with the number of older cancer survivors growing rapidly the better we understand the use of supplements the more valuable the insight we gain in our effort to improve health outcomes in cancer survivors
5306693 recent research indicates that it is probably best to get your nutrients from foods not supplements
5306694 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
5306695 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
5306696 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
5306697 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
5306698 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
5306699 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
5306700 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes

5306722 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
5306723 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
5306724 weve found that if the tgd4 protein is malfunctioning the plant then accumulates oil in its leaves
5306725 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient more research is needed so we can completely understand the mechanism of operation

5306794 once my condition had stabilized my interrogators resumed their work demands for military information were accompanied by threats to terminate my medical treatment if i did not cooperate eventually i gave them my ships name and squadron number and confirmed that my target had been the power plant pressed for more useful information i gave the names of the green bay packers offensive line and said they were members of my squadron when asked to identify future targets i simply recited the names of a number of north vietnamese cities that had already been bombed

5306800 i am very proud of the us capitol police officers who successfully prevented a dangerous felon from inflicting harm to our community
5306801 we also want to thank the assistant us attorneys for their outstanding work and prosecution of gorbey these outstanding efforts and the combined teamwork have resulted in getting a felon off the streets united progressive socialist states of america

5306848 we tried everything to find out the weak point of the chinese players it was difficult to find them on the other hand they found some weak points in the german team
5306849 we are really happy this silver is at this moment the maximum that you can reach in the team event because china is too dominant they are the best team in the world

5306854 washington reuters a u s appeals court on tuesday dismissed former
5306855 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
5306856 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
5306857 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
5306858 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
5306859 i like doing partnerships i think it does two things in the case of weather channel one is if you are in the cable business or news business the weather channel is one of the premier assets our ability to get it in a great deal the way we did i think is great i think every now and again when an industry goes through transition i like partnering with a private equity guy because it helps you understand whats the right price for weather channel in other words jeff and his team could come and say heres the right price for weather channel but i now have bain and blackstone and so if you like investing in cable the way i do every now and then i like getting a couple of validation points to say heres what you ought to be paying and you get two of the shrewdest guys in the world helping you validate it because were not done doing cable deals

5306864 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5306865 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5306866 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5306867 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5306868 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5306869 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5306870 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action

5306891 we definitely see hactivism taking place from people who have a political ideology and jump on the bandwagon with bots to help promote their opinions and viewpoints whether that be for war or against war or for or against certain countries
5306892 this appears to be more of an intelligence gathering effort rather than a distributed denial of service attack
5306893 the lightweight attacks that took place well over a month prior to this incident indicates other actors with motives different than hactivism are likely involved by the incident
5306894 these offences have had a devastating impact on both victims they were placed in foster care because of neglect and mistreatment at a very young age only to find that they were even less safe in their new home

5306899 were back from a mad but worthwhile couple of days of metal festival mayhem in spain and norway
5306900 our show in spain was a late one we came off stage in spain at 3 00 a m then it was back to the hotel for a quick shower and a two hour drive to the airport for our flight back to norway after a delay in oslo trying to find our missing gear we finally got to the
5306901 a huge thanks to everyone who came out to support us at the revoltallo festival in spain and the
5306902 the metal rock festival was just as crazy with our fellow country metallers going nuts and keeping us going as soon as we hit the stage the atmosphere was electric and all thoughts of sleep were forgotten the festival crew deserve a lot of credit for helping out with gear and making the show work we appreciate it we enjoyed it all and it looked like you did now time to catch up on some sleep

5306925 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5306926 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5306927 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5306928 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5306929 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5306930 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5306931 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5306932 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5306933 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5306934 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5306935 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5306936 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5306937 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5306938 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5306939 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5306940 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5306941 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5306942 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5306943 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5306944 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5306945 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5306946 this is a planning took where all things are going
5306947 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5306948 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5306949 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5306950 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5306951 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5306952 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5306953 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5306954 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5306955 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5306956 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5306957 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5306958 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5306959 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5306960 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5306961 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5306962 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5306963 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5306964 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5306965 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5306966 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5306967 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5306968 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5306969 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5306970 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5306971 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5306972 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5306973 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5306974 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5306975 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5306976 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5306977 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

5306989 the record industry is a very political place at the moment and i am on emi records lots of people have been fired or have taken redundancy recently as the company was taken over by a private equity firm called terra firma
5306990 many of these people were people assigned to my projects and now i dont quite know whats going on im sure everyone will find their feet soon enough and ill be able to put the album out soon

5306996 obviously its not going to be easy replacing chris but i think we have enough young talent that can step up and help this team win some games
5306997 since 2000 usc has been in a league of their own as far as college football is concerned theyre the only team that has been in the top three of four teams n the country every year and theyre the most talented college team that ive seen since the florida state teams of the middle and late 90s
5306998 i think he has a huge upside he knew very little and it is one of the real regrets about last season as head coach i wish i would have pulled the trigger on moving him hes a talented kid catches the ball well out of the backfield hes big and strong so hes durable
5306999 to us playing together is just knowing how each other plays and what our limits are
5307000 i think were getting real close to that as a whole line
5307001 we are moving the meter every single year two recruiting classes and creating an environment with the existing football team the one thing i give our current players a great deal of credit for is that they bought in instantly if you want to be good its going to take a passionate commitment
5307002 by the end of the first month of the season well have a pretty good idea of what kind of football team were going to have
5307003 obviously its not going to be easy replacing chris but i think we have enough young talent that can step up and help this team win some games
5307004 since 2000 usc has been in a league of their own as far as college football is concerned theyre the only team that has been in the top three of four teams n the country every year and theyre the most talented college team that ive seen since the florida state teams of the middle and late 90s

5307006 im headhunting your motherf ing ass dog im headhunting you
5307007 id rather deal with an add psycho than be killed in my sleep
5307008 im dumbfounded that she has the ethics in place to be even able to deduce that bravo megan for exceeding my expectations how will you surprise me next by wearing something other than a bikini
5307009 and thats one to grow on assuming that the nutritional content of throw up could in fact help you grow
5307010 i feel like this is the greatest comeback in american history
5307011 what time is it time to get rid of hoopz
5307012 i dont know man whats up with hoopz but we should all support the troopz
5307013 im not sure which i love more that rodeo corrects herself midway through the word
5307014 thats really sad but at least shell never be without seasoned meats
5307015 ive already hear this kind of music long years ago i need something fresh i think ill pass
5307016 but it is quite possible to have two quarters of negative growth and another couple of quarters of decent growth so the economy actually grows year on year despite going through a technical recession
5307017 les rebelles ont atteint le centre ville ils ont pris le contr le du quartier daffaires des banques des choppes de pr teurs sur gages
5307018 nous ne tol rerons pas cela et nous r primerons violemment toute tentative de perturber la paix et le d veloppement mindanao
5307019 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5307020 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5307021 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5307022 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5307023 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5307024 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5307025 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5307026 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5307027 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5307028 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5307029 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5307030 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5307031 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5307032 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5307033 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5307034 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5307035 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5307036 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5307037 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5307038 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5307039 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5307040 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5307041 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5307042 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5307043 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5307044 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5307045 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5307046 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
5307047 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians

5307049 the san diego county republican central committee is made up of only 60 or 70 members and is way out of step with most republicans in california and san diego from governor schwarzenegger to san diego mayor jerry sanders both schwarzenegger and sanders oppose the hateful proposition 8 we got a pretty good response from the guests pulling in who seemed interested in the fact sheet and i am sure it was a topic of discussion inside the gate
5307050 dont think we can allow something like that to happen here in california
5307051 to see the party that fought communism and big government now fighting the gays well thats just plain dumb
5307052 i think they same sex couples should be treated equally period
5307053 i have a longstanding record in favor of legislation to do away with discrimination
5307054 well first of all i think that it would never happen in california the passage of proposition 8 because i think that california people are much further along with that issue and number two i will always be there to fight against that
5307055 i decided to lead with my heart which is probably obvious at the moment
5307056 the concept of a separate but equal institution i am unwilling to send the message to anyone that
5307057 i wake up in the middle of the night sometimes and i think my god could this happen but then in the cool light of day i think it wont that im going to win my god i dont represent a bunch of bigots do i

5307059 how do you plan to change the tax code when it comes to capital gains how high will that 15 percent rate go
5307060 these are not the actions of curious individuals or even those who are sympathetic to terrorist objectives
5307061 they are the actions of people who pose a very real threat to our communities
5307062 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5307063 ive just got one left you can have it at a very good price
5307064 oh my god why did i not go this weekend

5307069 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5307070 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5307071 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5307072 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5307073 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
5307074 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago

5307078 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
5307079 i get the complaint of oh i wish i could see that
5307080 there was nowhere i could find that was just safe where maybe a slip of the finger would take us somewhere where i dont want the kids to see or hear
5307081 i dont know how not to have fun im dying and im having fun and im going to keep having fun every day i have left because there no other way to play it you have to decide if youre a tigger or an eeyore never lose the childlike wonder its just too important its what drives us
5307082 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills

5307084 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5307085 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5307086 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5307087 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5307088 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5307089 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5307090 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5307091 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5307092 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5307093 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5307094 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5307119 our land was so contaminated with radiation that we were forced into exile for 30 years the north of our atoll remains uninhabitable as for the bikinians theyre still not home 62 years after being removed by the americans
5307120 the us has no formal custodial responsibilities for the site
5307121 the islanders subsist on fish from the lagoon if there are cracks below and seepage of radioactive particulates then we are in a very big mess
5307122 i hope to god this will never be the case it would have both national and regional implications
5307123 there appears to be no measurable or discernable evidence of any leakage of radioactive waste from the dome impacting the marine environment
5307124 all those present seemed to realise radioactive material was leaking out of the crater and would continue to do so
5307125 it was fallout from castle bravo the largest nuclear bomb the us ever detonated and one of the worlds worst radiological disasters

5307130 it was obvious us150 million was never going to be sufficient to provide a just settlement for property loss as required under the us constitution
5307131 we are the only population ever to have been resettled on a nuclear test site our simple message to the us government and courts is that half a century later they respect our peoples sacrifice to their military cause and establish a long term monitoring program as they would if these tests had occurred in the continental united states

5307135 a reduction in use per customer as a result of conservation more efficient appliances more energy efficient building construction and other factors that negatively affect the companys revenues
5307136 increased customer usage the benefit of rate increases and reduced operating expenses
5307137 i had to do a double take and reread it to make sure i understood what was happening
5307138 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5307139 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5307140 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair
5307141 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5307142 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5307143 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5307144 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5307145 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5307146 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5307147 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5307148 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that if he wants to he can change flights the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa

5307154 for more than a decade the audiences for most traditional news sources have steadily declined as the number of people getting news online has surged
5307155 a sizable minority of americans find themselves at the intersection of these two long standing trends in news consumption
5307156 man muss deutlich sagen wir haben total versagt wir m ssen jetzt berlegen woran es gelegen hat die schw cheren haben uns gezeigt wie es geht
5307157 das waren nicht unsere spiele es l uft einfach nicht nicht vorne und nicht hinten

5307163 the one didnt have a life jacket on so when her friend reached the other side she looked back and didnt see her friend at all so she panicked and started screaming towards the crowd over on the beach
5307164 a couple of kids swam across and they started probing in the water trying to find her cause they couldnt see her
5307165 and when one kid finally found her they pulled her up on shore
5307166 when we showed up she was it looked like shed already gone cause her hands were blue and everything was blue
5307167 of course inflation and deflation are not about prices at all but rather about money supply and credit and credit especially credit marked to market is plunging
5307168 that is restricting bank lending business expansion etc consumers now finally realize they cannot depend on rising home prices as their retirement
5307169 when i was 13 years old the brother of one of my best friends was just about to sign a professional contract with leyton orient and he was walking down the street one afternoon when he saw a fight break out
5307170 he went over to help and ended up getting stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5307171 its been going on for a long time no one wants to see the devastation my friend and his family went through
5307172 as a parent of course you dont expect to pack your kids off to school in the morning and never see them again this campaign is very important it is something that us as footballers can help with
5307173 weve got a voice and weve got a voice that kids listen to its important that we get involved in this its so important that we believe that things can change
5307174 i have three teenage children living in london when i was there and and went to parties it was all right as long as you didnt come back too late and were in a sober state
5307175 nowadays your kids go out and you are fearing that they might come back hurt or damaged or worse
5307176 when we were growing up we all had releases in sport which meant we could focus on something and not get bored too many young people are bored and this is where the problems start
5307177 if someone thinks they are going to go to prison for a year or two of their young lives it might make them think twice about carrying a knife in the first place
5307178 some young people may think that carrying a knife makes them safer in fact the opposite is true if you carry a knife you risk it being used and possibly against you
5307179 it doesnt have to happen families grief doesnt have to happen and communities shouldnt have to live in fear

5307182 already the situation in kashmir is tense and the political vacuum that will be created in pakistan as a result of the resignation of musharraf does not augur well for india
5307183 it could well weaken pakistans fight over terrorists boosting their activities in india
5307184 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
5307185 like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
5307186 isi is behind them according to whatever information we have
5307187 rogue elements in it or an isi operating without control
5307188 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organizations such as the taliban
5307189 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
5307190 assess whether mindfulness based stress psychotherapy can prevent relapses as effectively as antidepressant medications
5307191 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5307192 im trying to do what is best for my family and thats why i left the city
5307193 i believe mechanic lannerd is an incompetent and untrustworthy mechanic who has put the lives of every pilot at risk in this unit with his deceptions and inability to follow faa regulations on the proper maintenance of aircraft in his care
5307194 it is my belief that lt williams had to be aware of robert lannerds poor job performance
5307195 he either chose to look the other way or sanctioned his poor performance hoping that our unit could continue to limp along
5307196 senior corporal marksteiner will embellish stories in order to be heard and make changes
5307197 he does not stop until issues are handled his way
5307198 i was told by the pilots that the screwdriver got away from mr lannerd and shot across the transmission like a speeding bullet
5307199 there can be no assurance that any strategic alternative or other transaction will be completed or if completed of its terms price or timing

5307202 thats something a viewer would have known only by omission gone were the sydney pans of happy crowds replaced by tight shots designed to hide their absence
5307203 when the network does wander its efforts to find the bright side often make pollyanna look churlish
5307204 the news is even worse at today where the attitude has become as juvenile as the dress is it too much to ask on air adults to trade flip flops for grown up shoes fridays broadcast devoted two sentences to the arrest of three american protesters and the forcible detention of journalists trying to cover the event thats it no pictures no follow up no reporting nothing that might take time away from cooking gushing or running one more look at me im on the balance beam segment

5307208 what is being built is an educational landscape unlike any other a radical experiment in reform
5307209 more than half of the citys public school students are now being educated in charter schools publicly financed but privately run and most of the rest are enrolled in schools run by an unusually decentralized and rapidly changing school district from across the country and in increasing numbers hundreds of ambitious idealistic young educators have descended on new orleans determined to take advantage of the opportunity not just to innovate and reinvent but also to prove to the rest of the country that an entire city of children in the demographic generally considered the hardest to educate poor african american kids can achieve high levels of success
5307210 the most encouraging development in american public education in decades
5307211 given the passage of time we have to validate the assumptions used in the model to support our offer price of 25 74 per share in cash in addition we no longer believe we can integrate take two ahead of the important holiday season accordingly we require due diligence to support a transaction and are therefore letting the tender offer expire tonight however we are pleased to accept your offer to review your management presentation as outlined in your letter
5307212 we continue to have great respect for creative teams and products and are hopeful that we can work together to reach a mutually agreed transaction
5307213 material non public information to which you would not otherwise have access including information relating to our three year product release schedule and managements financial projections the presentation also includes information about the underlying factors that have driven our strong operational and financial performance

5307222 he wanted to be a police officer since he was little
5307223 he thought he was going to get in there and stop all the crime in chicago
5307224 reassured them that anything we can do will be done to catch the perpetrators
5307225 he was always there on the front lines ready to volunteer

5307227 maybe some people are wired to be more sexual and also to have better erections for a longer period of time
5307228 do as the spirit moves you and make decisions about sexuality that are comfortable for you and your partner
5307229 if we put it onto our calendar when we have to have sex i think we lose the positive effect of sex on health
5307230 i know that by calling her a bitch you were really making a comment about how the producers cast the show but its hard enough for female chefs to to be taken seriously and i dont want to see leah reduced to a stereotype so id like to tell you a little more about her that way people can get the full picture before she was at centro leah spent a year working at eleven madison park working her way up the line to end up in charge of meat roast and fish roast before her stint at emp leah spent a year cooking at la mandia in sicily 1 michelin star leah is outspoken she likes to have fun but above all shes a serious cook shes been in some of the toughest kitchens in nyc and has the scars and burns on her arm to prove it i think she should go far in the competition

5307232 identifying the specific normal cells that cancers come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop
5307233 this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
5307234 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer
5307235 the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
5307236 menopause related testosterone predominance appears to be implicated as a key hormonal change that is associated with the incidence of metabolic syndrome
5307237 our study data shows that the change in estrogen level is at best a weak and nonsignificant predictor of metabolic syndrome risk
5307238 a more likely story is that the progressive testosterone predominance exerts a direct negative effect on cardiovascular risk

5307248 die gesellschaftliche und wirtschaftliche bedeutung des fu balls wird in deutschland trotz aller sonntagsreden der politiker immer wieder unn tig in frage gestellt und somit nicht angemessen gew rdigt mich w rde mal interessieren was passiert wenn wie in den usa oder italien die ganze liga streikt und damit den spielbetrieb an mehreren wochenenden einstellt
5307249 man muss sich dagegen wehren dass dem fu ball in deutschland unterstellt wird auf kosten der ffentlichen hand seine spiele durchzuf hren
5307250 denn es muss doch allen klar sein dass es in keinem anderen land der welt spitzenfu ball so g nstig f r die fans und konsumenten zu haben gibt wie bei uns
5307251 es geht hier um grunds tzliche dinge und nicht um eine besserstellung des fu balls gegen ber anderen m rkten aber es kann nicht sein dass die wirtschaftliche bedeutung des fu balls immer wieder von entscheidungstr gern untersch tzt wird

5307253 it is with great sorrow that we must announce this brave soldiers death as we offer our sympathies to this soldiers loved ones
5307254 this waste represents much more than an unnecessary burden to landfills or a financial loss incurred by hospitals
5307255 when viewed in contrast to the severe shortages of medical and surgical supplies for hospitals in developing nations this excess illustrates the need for a nation wide system of material recovery and reuse
5307256 now these materials that normally would be incinerated are being put to good use
5307257 we are collecting things in such a fashion that there is no risk of infection
5307258 we collect about 2 000 pounds of unused medical supplies every month and ship them in 40 ft containers to clinics and hospitals throughout the world
5307259 word is spreading at rush so the unused medical supplies we are collecting also are being provided to rush physicians and residents going on international medical missionary trips
5307260 our mission is to promote medical supply recovery and donation in chicago because its not only good for the environment and cuts hospital costs dramatically but it helps those in need
5307261 our research shows that proton channels in basophils respond vigorously to agents that elicit histamine release
5307262 we also determined that histamine was inhibited by zinc at concentrations that inhibit proton currents consistent with the idea that proton channel activity is linked to basophil activation
5307263 it is exciting to discover a novel function for proton channels
5307264 we believe this research could lead to new approaches to reduce the potentially deadly consequences of asthma and allergic reactions
5307265 oi get out we dont want your type in here
5307266 the most wasted of all days is one without laughter
5307267 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5307268 i am playing an unbelievable season no doubt i have to be very happy for everything the feeling for sure is very happy for being no 1 but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5307269 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to no 1 that if ever somebody were to take it away for me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically and then like this he can take no 1 so i think rafa totally deserves it
5307270 im shocked so thrilled with the way we did so exciting
5307271 what we did was already amazing so were already very happy

5307282 an economic lean period during the second half of the year
5307283 despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone inflation expectations of market participants according to surveys and financial market data have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run
5307284 the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures
5307285 its the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long lasting higher inflation rate
5307286 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5307334 wir dachten china w re nerv s doch sie waren sehr gut auf uns vorbereitet und haben losgelegt wie die feuerwehr dennoch haben wir seit ewigkeiten wieder eine medaille gewonnen und stehen nach einem superturnier auf dem podest
5307335 china war das bessere team wir haben versucht die schwachpunkte zu finden aber die gab es einfach nicht

5307378 zionists believe israel should not be defended from war criminals who bomb jewish communities indiscriminately to murder children with millions of landmines
5307379 you could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas
5307380 this barbarous act has no place among civilized peoples and shocks the conscience of all peace loving nations there is no cause that could ever justify this action
5307381 the politicians that we vote for wont stay and fight and they wont count the votes
5307382 the world should respect any action taken by ungodly zionist evil israel in order to defend its citizens
5307383 i grabbed her little sister and put her in front of me as the bullets began to fly the blood sprayed from between her eyes and then i laughed maniacally
5307384 the mass murdered unarmed innocent neighbors back door was open

5307394 anything that moves you kill and dont take any prisoners
5307395 if the defense version of events is true dismissal of the charge is justified

5307397 the marines have landed and we now as enron own a piece of afghanistan
5307398 it is not george bush it is not the neocons
5307399 i just want to point out that were going to encourage the people to look at the evidence for themselves
5307400 those who negotiate in the name of the taliban will be killed
5307401 if the absence of violence is victory no one will ever win
5307402 it is not george bush it is not the neocons

5307413 judge for yourselves whether it is right in gods sight to obey you rather than god for we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard
5307414 what we are looking at is going a step further with what were already doing around hoons
5307415 we see the potential for that footage being able to further extend what already takes place
5307416 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation
5307417 i get concerned about people driving in motor vehicles when theyre using their mobile phones
5307418 you might have that vigilante kind of thing we dont want our community to put themselves at risk
5307419 part of it is whether or not people are willing to go to court to give evidence whether or not you can actually use that information in a court of law

5307435 the ambush by around 15 gunmen on three senior employees who were traveling in armoured jeeps accompanied by 28 soldiers was so brutal that there was no alternative but to suspend operations
5307436 the current security environment makes it impossible for us to continue our operations in the niger delta and to protect our employees
5307437 indefinitely not just for the safety of expatriate staff but for everyone black and white
5307438 the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend will intervene towards the release of the two german construction staff of julius berger who were ambushed and kidnapped for ransom in rivers state of nigeria on friday july 11 2008 because from all indications the inept nigerian security forces have been unable to make any progress towards their freedom
5307439 we consider such criminal acts as a duty for the law enforcement agencies as practised in every part of the world and as a rule never get involved
5307440 mend has located and identified the culprits and will begin negotiating with the kidnappers in the hope for a safe and unconditional release of the captives
5307441 we received a disrespectful letter from julius berger and told it in the language they understand that if ever it is rude and sarcastic again the company should free the hostages themselves
5307442 dear jomo gbomo or whatever you name may be i understand that your organization mend will now help us in bringing back our kidnapped colleagues
5307443 i myself was the victim of one of your men last year
5307444 i would appreciate it if you could keep me updated on your progress in this issue needless to say confidentiality is guaranteed
5307445 the rescue was more of cunning as it gave the kidnappers the impression we were on the same page and had a grudge against julius berger
5307446 weeks of intense intelligence gathering planning and training culminated in this tactical victory for which we salute everyone involved including the coventry cathedral
5307447 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5307448 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5307449 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5307450 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5307451 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5307452 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5307453 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5307463 it is said that no star is a heroine to her makeup artist
5307464 botox remains the gold standard for treating crows lines and wrinkles
5307465 growth hormone should not be used for anti aging purposes
5307466 this costs hundreds to thousands of dollars a month and there is no scientific evidence supporting it and very real potentially serious side effects
5307467 if you went to a gym pretty regularly you might get that change without breaking into too much of a sweat
5307468 and you wouldnt spend 1 000 to 2 000 a month on something that appears to have minimal or no benefit and has the potential of some very serious side effects
5307469 equivalent in magnitude to the changes incurred during 10 to 20 years of aging
5307470 my suggestion is that growth hormone should not be used for anti aging
5307471 rather than looking at growth hormone as a magic bullet or ticket to the fountain of youth if you want to increase your chances of living a long and productive life you should do the things that your moms and doctors always told you eat right exercise often get enough sleep and dont smoke
5307472 caracol cream is 127 more effective at reversing the signs of aging than the market leader
5307473 it is very rare to see this many active ingredients included in one cream usually companies struggle to include even 2 or 3 of these into their product and usually resort to using the cheaper synthetic versions the fact that caracol cream included as many as they did naturally truly speaks for its anti aging abilities
5307474 inconsistent with both cadences recent public statements and recent communications
5307475 so i says i tell ya what you fellows put them up and ill keep them watered and thats how this all got started my big mouth
5307476 i had to give that up because it was taking too long i was doing the flowers belonging to all the businesses too i came to figure they could do it themselves id see people on their breaks out smoking by them you know they can manage to give em a drink
5307477 i says if you dont like the way i do it then you can come do it yourself
5307478 the one thing i wouldnt want the town council to do is say here sandy were going to pay you to do it it wouldnt mean the same thing to me this i knows im doing with my heart if they were going to pay me it wouldnt be through my heart itd be more or less for a gain
5307479 when im driving from here to bonavista theres nar flower that misses me eyes if i happens to see a different flower ill stop and have a look at it if im too busy ill keep it in the back of my mind and say one of these days
5307480 i gets mad sometimes when i comes around and people got stuff tore off the flowers i gets mad and says well im not gonna water em no more then i says no sir theyre not gonna get me no way suppose if i got to go down and bring up the flowers from my own house to put up there
5307481 if i can get this flower to grow down to here before he dies then ill be satisfied
5307482 i hopes and prays when i goes away to the cabin on the weekends they wont dry up when i comes back sunday evening i usually drives around and if they looks like they needs it then ill give em a drink
5307483 i was proud of it but i didnt really want it i gets enough recognition out of them flowers watchin em grow
5307484 my belief is if youre going to do nothing and theres something done that you dont like then dont open your mouth about it
5307485 if every person in clarenville volunteered once a week for an hour wed have no trouble winning that tidy towns theres no trouble for the town to get people to improve stuff
5307486 i usually kills every one of them i sees i dont like em see they gets in the flowers on the ground and eats em
5307487 if youre gonna ask me how long ill be at it ill say so long as i can climb up and down that ladder
5307488 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime

5307505 i dont know but im certainly happy to have scored points in hungary it was important for the team and for me and overall it was a very positive weekend the car worked well i did a lot of laps during free practice on friday and saturday morning and i was on the pace all weekend and felt comfortable its always nice to have that sort of weekend and i hope to continue like this for the rest of the season
5307506 this season i have already learned several new circuits but the difference this time is that all the drivers will be in the same position and having to learn the circuit i think that from the point of view of the championship its interesting to visit new tracks its an extra challenge for the drivers as well as the teams i have worked hard with the team to approach this race in the best shape possible and i will try to get on the pace quickly and maximise every lap in practice
5307507 its a street circuit so it will be quite tricky but also very interesting its never easy to learn a new circuit but as i have said this time all the teams and drivers will be in the same position it will be interesting to see who can get comfortable fastest

5307513 russia has finished the operation on halting georgias aggression against south ossetia
5307514 there is a distinction between the understandings of a pullback and a withdrawal in the conversation with french president sarkozy the discussion was about an pullback of forces not a withdrawal
5307515 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5307516 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5307517 assured that georgians would not continue to use military force
5307518 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5307519 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5307520 personally i dont think china should strive to win so many gold medals
5307521 coming in second or third place in gold medals is good enough im just worried that others may look at us as being cocky if we win too many
5307522 this was the most important medal of all for chinese people
5307523 its different from pingpong or diving in track and field you are competing against the whole world when liu won we felt on top of the world all the other medals are small compared to this one
5307524 behind the medals count everybodys excited to see chinas athletes in the lead as well as american swimmer michael phelps achievement of breaking world records and winning eight golds but were even happier to see the competitors from more countries and regions climb on top of the medals podium
5307525 its very misleading to see what the official media are presenting
5307526 people feel very strongly about winning when the games are over youll see a burst of patriotism
5307527 if we put up photos of all the medal winners there would be too many
5307528 the local definition of homeless is a snowboarder without a girlfriend
5307529 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5307530 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5307531 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5307532 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5307533 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5307534 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5307535 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5307536 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5307537 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5307538 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5307539 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5307540 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

5307555 the way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states
5307556 youd like to win them all but we didnt win the idea is improving between the first and second game
5307557 there was some good some bad but ultimately we still lost the game
5307558 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5307559 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5307560 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5307561 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5307562 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5307563 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5307564 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5307565 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5307566 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5307567 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5307568 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5307569 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5307570 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5307571 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5307572 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5307573 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5307574 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5307575 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5307576 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5307577 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5307578 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5307579 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5307580 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5307581 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5307582 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5307583 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5307584 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5307585 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5307586 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5307587 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5307588 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5307589 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5307590 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5307591 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5307592 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

5307598 do i take my kid to the ball game or fill up my tank
5307599 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5307600 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5307601 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5307602 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5307603 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5307604 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5307605 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5307606 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5307607 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5307608 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5307609 who are open to doing something on the production side
5307610 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5307611 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5307612 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5307613 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5307614 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5307615 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5307616 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5307617 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5307618 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5307619 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5307620 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5307621 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5307622 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5307623 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5307624 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5307625 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5307626 our goal is to hopefully have a memorial erected by 2014 the 100th anniversary
5307627 several communities lost loved ones but elliston lost the most a father and son died in each others arms so thats very poignant and dramatic hopefully our statue will show that
5307628 im happy and proud to be associated with the movement youre putting forward
5307629 i cant get into anything controversial being the lieutenant governor i have to be politically neutral
5307630 my opinions havent changed just because im lieutenant governor i just may not repeat them
5307631 i dont want to disabuse anyone that its going to take a lot of hard work but you can do it
5307632 they shouldnt be forgotten nor should the rest of the men and boys who were lost in that tragedy
5307633 so it wont be forgotten so future generations can have a more general understanding of the need for it at that point in time
5307634 we have also established an endowment at the orange county community foundation to ensure textbooks be paid for thereby benefiting our students for many years to come regardless of what the future may hold with casino dollars coming to the organization we intend on contributing a portion to the fund each year for continued growth
5307635 whether the new commission was going to undertake the lda local development agreement previously on the table with the hhpc it is also now the plan of the new commission
5307636 that the foundation has been well organized and very prepared and initiated the program very responsibly it has been a pleasure to have the opportunity through the foundation to provide this kind of funding it has proven to be very meaningful to our parents and to the entire community
5307637 it has enabled us to pay for textbooks and in a very prompt manner
5307638 has just been a real benefit for the overall school and community
5307639 i think now with the economy as it is it definitely helps out many of our communitys families
5307640 were certainly continuing to improve which is very encouraging we were on the pace in hungary the car felt good and we showed we are still moving forward and that we will fight hard to finish in fourth place in the championship it was important also to get a solid result before the summer break its good for the mood in the team and means we can come back motivated for the rest of the year
5307641 yes of course im very happy to be driving at home for a second time its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it in barcelona we were having a strong race when i had to retire but i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers
5307642 yes it will be interesting for me and also for the team who have been working hard in preparation for this race for the last couple of months as a new circuit i think it gives the drivers a chance to show what they can do but i am not under any illusions as i expect all the drivers to be quick we must do our best to find our reference points quicker than the others in order to spring a surprise

5307653 is that despite those losses weve grown quite a bit with our existing partners we wouldnt be growing if we didnt have a good product portfolio and good plants
5307654 this is a very meaningful show of support from our senior lenders
5307655 we appreciate the confidence that our senior lenders board of directors and ownership have shown in the management team and in all the employees at international bedding during what has been a very difficult period for the entire bedding industry as international bedding enters the second half of the year we are financially stable our plant operations continue to improve our sales are growing and we are very optimistic about the future

5307662 the hgtv name gave us a huge brand exposure and instant consumer creditability
5307663 i am not so naive as to totally discount the strength of the hgtv name
5307664 i certainly understand the loss that the program has endured however there were costs to the benefits hgtv was bringing to the table
5307665 additionally without hgtv controlling the ad sales nhfa can approach all components in our industry without regard to existing hgtv advertising contracts
5307666 it looks like the program would cost lest than one third of the cost under the prior program
5307667 it has been my joy and pleasure to see our business grow from a small local foam fabricator to a large business which spans the country

5307679 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5307680 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5307681 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5307682 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century

5307710 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5307711 this was a barbaric act carried out by the enemies of afghanistan at a time of celebration of independence
5307712 let us shun tribal linguistic and regional issues and wage jihad against the enemies of this country and its religion and their mercenaries so we can mark the independence anniversary in its actual form
5307713 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5307714 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5307715 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5307716 were not as concerned about it as we initially were

5307726 some people get the mistaken impression that this is a toy store or rental space but we turn these people away
5307727 we are near akihabara here so young people come down en masse looking for fun
5307728 i run a burasera used uniform shop so i know well what the customers want
5307729 i partnered up with doll producers to provide them with proper uniforms not just cheap costumes and still have these connections i am also a friend of the man importing real dolls so i can get a better price
5307730 i went to the ward office and told them i could help people who are handicapped or elderly and need these dolls

5307735 it used to be that men couldnt even have dolls let alone play with them but with these you can pose them change their heads and clothes you can make them as you want to it seems natural for figure collectors to go to the next stage of more customization and posing
5307736 when the dolls started to go into limited editions that is when the maniacs started to get interested
5307737 however our products were not intended to be for otaku and are not limited to akihabara
5307738 the media thinks that we do this because we are perverts with sexual feelings for our dolls or something
5307739 i like dolls because of their artistry and beauty they are not cute like anime characters but sophisticated and beautiful
5307740 people cant hear my friends dolls because they dont believe
5307741 if i continue on this path i might go wet

5307831 theres lots of fish out there we just cant catch it
5307832 so the preliminary numbers show about a 22 percent bycatch of cod overall

5307861 whenever anyone asks why invest in china the answer is very simple thats where the money and exponential future growth is
5307862 the bank of china boc conducted a study of the effects of 12 olympiads on their host countries over the course of 60 years they found that nine of the twelve olympic host countries suffered a decline in gdp growth in the eight years after the games
5307863 the key to a post olympic slump is the size of the economy smaller economies like korea suffered larger downturns after the games while larger economies like the united states were not affected at all
5307864 in smaller economies the enormous investment dedicated to staging olympic games created an arti cial bubble which was followed by a slump when olympic building booms came to an end
5307865 china has made one of the largest investments ever in the olympic games with some estimates of spending topping 40 billion but we dont believe the capital city will go into a slump after the games
5307866 in fact beijing has been forced to defer other infrastructure projects during the run up to the games those and other pressing projects are expected to take up the economic slack in the city after the olympics

5307871 its a highly unusual request but beijing says its a necessary move to prevent service disruptions due to increased loads on networks in chinas fast growing wireless communications sector
5307872 when new subscriptions resume we expect china mobile to retain its position as the largest and fastest growing cell phone company in china
5307873 with more than 407 million subscribers china mobile retains an excellent reputation and has added as many as 6 million new subscribers every month thats an 87 share of the new subscriber market and a 69 share of the total market

5307888 cling onto a retard until you get tired and lose grip fall down the bottomless pit which is more like an endless acid trip you think you are the shit but in a literal sense that could be accomplished you belong in a sewer not on the pedestal you stand on to make yourself look big you are an intellectual midget on stilts covered in trinkets and wrapped in silk you lack a conscience so you feel no remorse or guilt the only time you spill your guts is when youre on the throne not in the regal sense of the word but the one that is a porcelain bowl which is a result of that action that can be compared to when your mouth loses control which you are connected to your agendas which have been detached from your soul which allowed you to fly away without the aid of your steering because you where busy with your bullshit electioneering too busy talking about the positive equity flow with negative gearing but nothing is certain for you when death is peering can you tell me what voices youre hearing because those voices will start shaking when the end is nearing so every facet of your life will crack and start disappearing when you look for the meaning you chose to ignore as you raped every soul like a two bit whore but as you can see now thats not my problem anymore

5308245 i think about going to audio achievements at the end of van ness right there in torrance thats where we recorded it was a textbook 80s studio the wood paneling on the walls it was cold in there too we were used to working out of the garage man where it was sweaty and muggy we were in jackets and our teeth are chattering
5308246 you can hear the frustration with the situation we tried to have fun with it but the music was reflecting what was going on in the neighborhood living in the 1980s just trying to get by day by day in places where crack was huge and the police were crazy

5308256 if youre going to do it this is the strategy people are using
5308257 in fact i think youre on record i believe saying that one of the ways that the west could protest is to boycott the winter olympics in russia that is coming up is that the case
5308258 brzezinski well if the issue is not resolved consistent with international norms by some accommodation and the russians insist on the unilateral seizure of these georgian provinces then 2014 is the year when the winter olympics are to be held right next door to these seized provinces
5308259 well then the question would arise whether the west should participate in these olympics

5308267 im turning sixty soon im ready to talk about malibu
5308268 my mother used to drive some of the neighborhood guys down to the beach they would put their boards in her model t i tagged along i wanted to surf it looked like so much fun i pestered everybody for lessons i remember asking a surfer named scooter if i was bothering him he said youre breathing arent you there was this guy named tubesteak living in a shack a few other surfers were always hanging around they were always hungry i think some of them lived there too
5308269 it was blue and had a totem pole on it today it would be worth a small fortune
5308270 if you add up the raw commerce based on the gidget movies and television shows alone
5308271 not to mention the rest of the surf industry which for the most part erupted in the 1960s youve got a multi billion dollar empire built almost entirely on gidgets back
5308272 my father and i would walk down to the beach
5308273 showed me the first time how to get on my knees to push the shoulders up and slide the body back to spring to your feet quickly putting them a foot apart and under you in one motion thats quite tricky but then surf riding is not playing monopoly and the more i got the knack of it the more i was crazy about it and the more i was crazy about it the harder i worked at it

5308285 i personally dont agree that the roads should be free
5308286 we should be subsidizing mass transit which has all kinds of benefits as opposed to roads which have all kinds of costs
5308287 it seems they cannot tolerate any democracy on their borders
5308288 because if you start saying the soviet union was bad well what was at fault one party rule a lack of human rights
5308289 not because people any longer are afraid of it but because it is a thriving and effective country
5308290 for russia respect is based not on achievement or accomplishment but intimidation and fear that was the greatness of the soviet union

5308301 this is not the geopolitical monster of soviet times this is all about money the government is business its about gazprom its about rosneft
5308302 putin himself is an expert in this he studied very well he is like the ceo of an energy company

5308305 no country in the world has benefited more from the worldwide advance of democracy than the united states

5308307 americans are starting to view this goal as no longer desirable or attainable
5308308 all they ghanas national olympic committee say is go and get gold go and get gold
5308309 when i got here and gave them all my bills they said there was no money here until we get back to ghana but i know i wont get any
5308310 we sacrifice a lot you cant spend thousands of euros and then get here beijing to be given 1 800 which is nothing how can i pay my bills how can i pay my house rent
5308311 and so i prefer to stay back in europe and compete and get my own money its better than being here and getting nothing i have to save my energy

5308339 it is very beautiful to be here in beijing the facilities are just unimaginably great the situation is awful in gaza for everyone of course and it is also very bad for sports the israelis are constantly launching attacks on gaza there is a siege all our facilities have been damaged or destroyed we dont have a proper athletics stadium we all have to do our training on the street

5308345 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5308346 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5308347 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5308348 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5308349 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5308350 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5308351 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5308352 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5308353 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5308354 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet

5308362 ketika aku sedang menganyam kubayangkan orang orang yang akan duduk tidur dan sujud di atas tikar yang kubuat itu bukankah ini satu kebahagiaan karena tanganku masih punya manfaat bagi orang lain bagiku hidup ongkang ongkang tanpa manfaat itu artinya sama saja dengan hidup sekadar menunggu mati
5308363 ik zag die oranje tribunes al die mensen die voor mij waren gekomen dat was zo kicken toen kon het eigenlijk niet meer stuk de spanning kan me niet groot genoeg zijn toen zag ik het hoofd van mijn coach jacco groot in beeld op het scherm dat vond ik wel grappig

5308371 maar de vraag is natuurlijk wat dnb gaat doen als de economie daadwerkelijk gaat herstellen dan is de kans aanwezig dat de rente verhoogd wordt om het inflatiegevaar te beteugelen en kan het herstel in de kiem worden gescoord
5308372 we zijn ook al weer bijna door het cijferseizoen heen
5308373 je ziet liever dat de koersen omhoog gaan met wat meer power
5308374 ja en dan houdt het ook wel weer een beetje op de banken doen het rustig aan maar dat heeft misschien ook te maken met het feit dat de britse bradford amp bingley een aandelenemissie heeft zien mislukken
5308375 means of reaching those who have committed crimes in the combat zone military people whose crimes go undetected until after they have left the service
5308376 he can only get a fair shake if those civilians are honorably discharged marines who fought
5308377 soccer moms and pops cant understand the horrors of war or the complex set of rules of engagement that these marines face
5308378 id love for my guy to be tried by civilians
5308379 i think there are enough people out there who dont approve of the war but still approve of the people fighting it
5308380 that is coming from the battalion commanders we got to get from point a to point b and we aint got time to throw anything on the truck cause we moving
5308381 the honor and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honor of the office of president will also be affected
5308382 thank god hes resigned the country will do much better now

5308384 no new or increased federal or state excise taxes or other unforeseen extraordinary event
5308385 umm this game is rigged and skewed in favor of one side
5308386 so many companies have gate keepers between the decision maker and you
5308387 the internet search tips we learned helped put us on a new course
5308388 because almost every company e mail address has the same ending as the companys website
5308389 observed that the market is well supplied with current commercial oil stocks standing above their five year average the conference further noted with concern that the current price environment does not reflect market fundamentals as crude oil prices are being strongly influenced by the weakness in the us dollar rising inflation and significant flow of funds into the commodities market
5308390 the call sheet itself is a document distributed to the crew and cast to let them know what is going on for the next day
5308391 these documents are manually keyed in beforehand and distributed to different assistant directors so they can do planning and discuss what is feasible but everything is so dynamic it keeps changing every day from a scene to a prop or when things go wrong
5308392 if a call sheet has to be manually entered it is pretty much what the production co ordinator would be doing for the entire day
5308393 the main thing is that the production co ordinator who usually generates the call sheet will be able at the click of a button to select which day they want to generate the call sheet and within seconds receive all the information consolidated from different sources
5308394 we will be improving different modules for example so the production manager will be able to manage the crew in a more efficient manner through our scheduling tool
5308395 currently we are building a set of tools for the film industry and particularly for production companies in australia such as porchlight
5308396 once companies get a bit down the carbon reduction path they want to build a granular view of individual product footprints
5308397 its not really happening here yet but retailers in the us and britain are definitely pushing for it
5308398 tesco in britain for example wants to enable consumers to compare products not just on price or content but on the carbon created in getting that item to the shelf
5308399 you may find a product is generating little profit yet the manufacturing process creates a lot of carbon you may conclude its no longer feasible to retain that product line
5308400 in other cases modelling will allow you to see where components such as packaging or transport could be outsourced to suppliers using green energy
5308401 we saw several years ago that the next evolution of adaptive supply chains would be around adjusting to low carbon sources not just low cost manufacturing countries
5308402 tenants were asking how green their buildings were and owners are now aspiring to achieve five or six star ratings for their properties
5308403 we realised owners needed to be able to report their emissions and decided to build a product that would capture the data and put it into a format for reporting
5308404 one of the key requirements under the act is comparability between companies within a sector
5308405 in this way we can see which companies are doing well and which need to put more effort into reducing emissions
5308406 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory
5308407 we started talking to them in 2002 to map out initial requirements and beijing became the first olympiad to have 16m by 9m screens
5308408 we can make screens whatever size is required but ultimately we supply according to the request of the venue owner and bocog
5308409 like bocog a few years ago panasonic is already in initial talks with the organising committees of the next winter and summer games
5308410 its much too early for any decisions from britain too but a temporary large screen will be installed in london to show the games handover ceremony from beijing
5308411 in all of our stores hdtv sales are up between 10 per cent and 40 per cent and probably by at least 40 per cent in the last few weeks
5308412 it is the only product i can think of at the moment that is selling like hotcakes
5308413 its almost not worth putting standard definition televisions on the floor even at 89 people are just not interested
5308414 channel seven is using their own equipment and not ours
5308415 we have 44 feeds in total including four beauty shots for various sceneries
5308416 were excited about what more can be done for future games
5308417 i love my victor reader stream and it travels with me wherever i go

5308419 its one of the most impressive and well planned and well working pieces of equipment i have seen for a long time
5308420 we appreciate the overwhelming enthusiasm of our customers and are pleased that we have been able to incorporate many of their suggested new features and improvements in the enhanced version 2 of the stream
5308421 and the best news is that the latest version 2 software can be installed for free on all existing victor reader streams
5308422 victor reader stream the proven success story is now even better with a free version 2 0 software upgrade

5308436 theyre coming into peoples homes without a search warrant searching our homes looking for people its not right
5308437 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
5308438 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
5308439 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
5308440 um theres a lot more to it than that dude
5308441 angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies

5308445 i was just 13 when one of my best friends brothers was about to sign a contract with leyton orient
5308446 but one day he was walking the streets saw a fight went over to help got stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5308447 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign
5308448 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened
5308449 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5308450 i went to the same school as stephen and i will never forget when the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said he had been killed there was a sombre and chilling atmosphere
5308451 one day the guy was enjoying life and talking about his a levels and the next day he was gone he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
5308452 thankfully the headmaster at that school led a few campaigns highlighting knives and things like that and in hindsight we can all appreciate it
5308453 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives if you go to prison now it will be a step in the right direction
5308454 people need to know it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5308455 communities and youth centres also need to play a bigger part boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5308456 im delighted the fa and the england team are supporting are campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime
5308457 you can only solve this by working together the england players are role models for this generation and i hope their messages have a positive impact
5308458 i want to reassure the public that we the government the police and local authorities are doing all we can to tackle knife crime and to get knives off our streets
5308459 have it on very good authority that benni mccarthy and anton ferdinand will be lining up at whl on saaturday for sunderland mccarthy will cost arpund 9 million and ferdinand will cost around 7 million
5308460 im still looking for explanations as to how these injuries occurred
5308461 the paramedics are here were on our way to the hospital somethings wrong with graham
5308462 we were all trying to wrap our heads around that
5308463 but my main focus was on how to help my son and salvage our family
5308464 for two months we went to counseling i really thought people could change
5308465 i was looking for a confession from him an im sorry
5308466 but it was all about what the system was doing to him
5308467 daddy had to move out of the house because some people think daddy had something to do with grahams owie on his head
5308468 pathways in his brain have been severed and will never be able to be repaired
5308469 you go to a doctors office and theres nothing to do but with this you go where you were going anywhere
5308470 all of a sudden it was all over the place
5308471 publix has to defend their territory so they have teamed up with the little clinic
5308472 we partnered with the little clinic to have another way to offer our customers convenient quality care
5308473 its quite possible that these visits are being made for things that didnt even require a visit
5308474 the industry always does a great job of measuring everything for example right down to the number of positive strep tests by each practitioner
5308475 theres going to be some thought as to where the next clinics are going and theres going to be severe pruning
5308476 but once they get to a certain size they get a lot of interest from multinationals
5308477 australia is not the easiest market there have been times when fast growing australian it companies had to let go of some of their equity and bring in venture capitalists so individual stakes got diluted
5308478 gps technology brings great benefits to visually impaired travellers with this new addition to our product line humanware now offers gps benefits to an even wider portion of the visually impaired population

5308481 we are working on a brand new ep that were planning on releasing for free through our website early fall 2008 itll have 3 5 songs on it and will possibly include a special cover
5308482 bad penalties hurt us i was talking to dallas coach wade phillips and we were talking about how its like a turnover we have to stop it we overcame them a little bit but they would catch up to us eventually
5308483 were putting ourselves in bad situations just a lot of little things are holding us back no one can overcome making a lot of mistakes we just need to start staying out of these situations
5308484 we had opportunities and we didnt take advantage of them
5308485 we moved the ball and then there was a penalty and that hurt us those kind of things hurt us but i think were going to be all right
5308486 we practiced with denver all week and we did well
5308487 they changed up their whole game plan that is good on their part
5308488 i threw the ball well today and had a good camp this week
5308489 yawning disparity between what americans expect and what theyre willing or able to pay
5308490 as an organization of lay men that has a strong history and commitment to life we think it is very important to highlight the issues faced by those fathers whose children are aborted
5308491 there are three victims of every abortion the child and both of his or her parents and it is our hope that this conference will be the beginning of a ministry within the church to these fathers who grieve the death of their unborn child in isolation and silence
5308492 while there is still a decided preference for senator obama the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like
5308493 as the finer points of a wide range of issues are clarified by each nominee the initial excitement about senator obama has lost some luster to an increasing number of people whose vote is influenced by their spiritual perspectives if sen mccain converts such apprehensions into votes this will be a closer race than many have anticipated
5308494 the mccain campaign can not be satisfied with thinking evangelicals and conservative faith voters will vote for mccain as long as they thoroughly demonize obama
5308495 evangelical leaders and grassroots activists continue to tell the brody file that mccain needs to start incorporating faith and values talk into his speeches and town halls
5308496 so yes mccain leads 61 17 among evangelical christians but the drop from 78 should be a red flag if john mccain wants to win the presidency he needs a fully mobilized energized evangelical base behind him
5308497 they are being deceptive by characterizing this proposed law as more reasonable and less restrictive
5308498 the truth is that this ban would be the most rigid and inflexible ban on abortion in the united states
5308499 would allow politicians to interfere with personal decisions best made by women and their families
5308500 a pregnant or recently pregnant woman is more likely to be a victim of homicide than to die of any other cause
5308501 women who are pregnant are at particular risk of being targeted for violence in fact recent studies by two different state health departments have shown that a leading cause of maternal mortality is not complications during pregnancy or childbirth rather its homicide
5308502 for every story we hear there are countless more that go untold such as the story of marion syversen a board member of feminists for life who lost her unborn child when her abusive father threw her down a flight of stairs when she was pregnant
5308503 his gallbladder had ruptured and gangrene had formed in his stomach he was 80 plus and the doctors said his constitution wouldnt be able to take the strain of an operation but there was no choice he had to be operated on
5308504 he was all right during surgery but soon complications developed he couldnt breathe and he had a massive heart attack that killed him
5308505 he was really miserable in his illness he couldnt talk and he couldnt make his discomfort apparent to us so there was a complete lack of communication
5308506 you cant have 500 000 acres of land and just develop 100 000 we will take it from you and use it for development purposes
5308507 government does not have such amount therefore as soon as we get the feasibility report we would look for partner to privatize it
5308508 lehman brothers will vigorously defend any legal proceedings commenced where we do not feel there is merit
5308509 following an extensive review of bi products we felt that the bitam software provided the comprehensive solution to best fit into our environment and lead us forward in our business decision making skills with the dashboard and reporting capabilities in artus our executives will no longer rely upon paper reports to alert them on business activities this process will now be streamlined and provide for an effective means of monitoring the business
5308510 additionally we will not have to involve our it department for generating reports as the product is so easy to use that even i can build a dashboard
5308511 chew this one and you have 20 minutes of life left and this one does for you in 15 minutes
5308512 i always wanted to live in a house full of toys
5308513 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5308514 doubting thomas what exactly is barack obamas problem with clarence thomas
5308515 regardless of what obama might say about particular decisions obamas justices would not only presumably make up these new rights they would strip us of our second amendment rights while giving child rapists more rights and taking away the rights of the people through their legislators to make these important decisions
5308516 apparently obama can do no better than to recycle discredited statements of harry reid when it comes to justice thomas like other liberal elites obama cannot stand it when a black man strays from the ideological plantation and refuses to implement liberal policies through the courts but obama will never point out any intellectual deficiencies in justice thomass work because he cant justice thomass opinions consistently reveal faithfulness to the constitution judicial modesty and deference to the will of the people in our representative democracy that is opposed to everything that obama and the liberals are trying to do in grabbing power from the people and giving it to the courts
5308517 obamas answer about the three wisest people in his life upon whom he would rely heavily in his administration also sheds light on the way he would choose supreme court justices
5308518 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
5308519 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
5308520 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
5308521 its the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5308522 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met people are different they have different chemistry

5308526 to indicate that there was no violence that night is inaccurate

5308528 in the coming months and years he warned the united states was likely to face a once in a lifetime housing bust an oil shock sharply declining consumer confidence and ultimately a deep recession he laid out a bleak sequence of events homeowners defaulting on mortgages trillions of dollars of mortgage backed securities unraveling worldwide and the global financial system shuddering to a halt these developments he went on could cripple or destroy hedge funds investment banks and other major financial institutions like fannie mae and freddie mac

5308537 an open mic radio show is helping mexican nationals in northwest arkansas navigate the system of getting identification to make life easier in the united states and on return trips home to mexico chao said this radio program is a good way to reach our community and go straight to the people
5308538 the cards can be used to open bank accounts and fly on some airlines
5308539 the child can get dual nationality to let him enroll in school or obtain services in mexico chao said
5308540 this is helpful because you never know in the future when a family may suddenly want to return continue reading on
5308541 chao said the consulates office doesnt try to distinguish between legal and illegal mexican nationals who seek help
5308542 we dont ask for immigration status that is out of our hands he said
5308543 andres chao said the u s and mexican governments must work together to address the growing problem of illegal immigration in such a way that benefits both countries and their citizens
5308544 he dismissed the notion that migration to the united states is an attempt by the mexican government to export its poverty and said mexico sorely misses the young workers that cross daily into the united states
5308545 it was only by the grace of god that nobody was hurt
5308546 todays sentence recognizes the significant threat that gorbey posed to the public at large and to those government officials he believed had offended him
5308547 as the court noted today but for the professionalism and patience of the uniformed members of the u s capitol police this could easily have developed into a deadly confrontation this case serves as an important reminder of the risks that law enforcement officers take each day to protect the citizens employees and institutions of the nations capitol
5308548 i am very proud of the u s capitol police officers who successfully prevented a dangerous felon from inflicting harm to our community
5308549 we also want to thank the assistant u s attorneys for their outstanding work and prosecution of gorbey these outstanding efforts and the combined teamwork have resulted in getting a felon off the streets
5308550 the more people hear about it the less it will happen
5308551 parents need to remember that children especially younger and smaller ones get dehydrated faster
5308552 if it can happen to them it can certainly happen to anybody
5308553 basically its saying that its ok to leave your child in the car for 15 minutes
5308554 weve done a tremendous outreach effort with law enforcement the state attorneys offices and the community
5308555 and the law its got a little more teeth in it hopefully a combination of the two will mean fewer children die
5308556 parents and caregivers are multitasking more than ever these days she said theyre not bad people theyre sleep deprived and frazzled
5308557 if it can happen to them it can certainly happen to anybody
5308558 i am very pleased to carry on as club captain this season
5308559 it was my first season as captain last year and although i am 31 now i am still learning
5308560 i really enjoyed the responsibility last season everyone could see that and i tried to do the best job i possibly could
5308561 it was a really positive experience and this season i have to use that and carry on doing my best for the team
5308562 i know a lot more about the job now thanks to last season
5308563 it is true that we have the objective of doing better than we did last season so we have to keep on improving that has to be our aim
5308564 we are a young side and some more promising youngsters have come through for this season but they have all got the quality which you need to have if you play for arsenal
5308565 if you play at this club you must be ready to play at the very highest level
5308566 have it on very good authority that benni mccarthy and anton ferdinand will be lining up at whl on saaturday for sunderland mccarthy will cost arpund 9 million and ferdinand will cost around 7 million
5308567 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
5308568 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous

5308682 back in the day we had some creative control over our own individual characters we were allowed to develop our own personalities and our own style and thats what made everybody unique and different it would be very hard for me for somebody to hand me a written script as to what they think my character might say no matter how good they may be or how talented they might be at what theyre doing i dont think i would have succeeded in that environment i just needed to know when i did an interview what were the bullet points then i would put on my thinking cap and try to think of a new approach something to make my interview different from everybody elses and different from my last interview

5308686 the original horsemen will always be special to me because they were what started it all and it wasnt molded creatively it was an impromptu thing the fans really made it happen and it was because of the uniqueness of the talent but in terms of the in ring product and the capability of the type of matches about the third time through when barry windham was there was the best in ring product because barry had everything barry was young tall good looking had an amazing athleticism could really do anything in the ring and would have made a great world champion so thats my favorite group in terms of what could happen in the ring
5308687 jodys broken his metatarsal and could be out for three months at the outside
5308688 hell have it pinned and then well take it from there
5308689 its a huge blow to lose jody because hes one of our most experienced players and has always done really well for me
5308690 obviously its a blow for him as well because its always most difficult for the player its bizarre because there wasnt a bad tackle in the game and yet there are two broken bones
5308691 jodys got a broken metatarsal and richard hinds for sheffield wednesday has got a broken leg

5308810 ron came home from tahoe last march feeling pretty wonderful within a few weeks he forgot and threw one of our 78 lb granddaughters up in the air in the pool and spent several bad days in bed i called dr w and arranged a phone call with him and a chiropractor here the doctor here put rons neck back in place and he seemed good for a few days then it went out again hes had to go back to this doctor as it continued to go out for no reason that we know of he saw this chiropractor weekly then twice a month all of 2007 and now into 2008 the doctor here insists hes doing exactly what dr w told him to do but we seriously wonder as ron is exactly as he was before tahoe this is not good ron started taking lyrica a month ago it has dramatically eliminated his pain but for two weeks all he wanted to do was sleep that stopped but now he is slightly spacey and forgetful hes trying to decide if he should continue taking it so where is ron at back to where he was before being treated by dr w

5308813 follow up care is not needed in most cases we do have two different modalities we have you use at home these devises have proved satisfactory and almost never is any other follow up by a practitioner needed in the event you get home and find that you start having any return in symptoms that cannot be resolved with your home treatment contact a local chiropractor immediately and have him or her call our office we will make sure your doctor has adequate information to follow up on your care and keep your symptoms to a minimum the most difficult part of your treatment will be taken care of while you are here and any follow up should be easy for your local doctor to perform

5308835 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from

5308864 for nearly 40 years the secretary esther hoffe held the world of kafka scholarship on tenterhooks keeping the documents in her ground floor apartment on spinoza street some of them piled high on her desk it was originally mr brods where she typed all day and took her meals
5308865 as her mother did hava hoffe is keeping scholars and archivists up at night wondering about the condition of what they believe are letters diaries photographs and perhaps unpublished works of the two authors
5308866 to start off we misread the wicket a bit we thought it may not seam or swing that much as the breeze was strong we expected it to swing throughout the day which it did but i think there was a fair bit in the wicket to start off
5308867 the sri lankan bowlers bowled really well the top two batsmen they got out not due to a bad shot they got out of their defence the credit goes to their fast bowlers i think they got wickets
5308868 later on ajantha mendis put the pressure and the only thing we were doing was to catch up and it really gets tough in the one dayers if you lose too many wickets upfront
5308869 if you see muralitharan and mendis they are different bowlers
5308870 so far it hasnt been a distraction because its been through a process
5308871 its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players a fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not
5308872 we want to listen to what haroon has to say the key being that if an england team is going there its got to be safe for them to go otherwise were not going to go
5308873 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5308874 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5308875 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5308876 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5308877 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5308878 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5308879 in my own personal experience i see that each semester requires a different approach
5308880 this is even true when i teach the same course twice in a semester different times of the day or lengths of classes require different methods just as different quality students require different approaches
5308881 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
5308882 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students
5308883 one of the most beautiful things about america to me is the creativity that we instill in our primary and secondary schools
5308884 i know that we lag behind many countries in test scores but i believe we also produce some of the most creative enthusiastic students in the world
5308885 our recent studies into what occurs during the chemical reaction caused by tamls proves that the catalysts are indeed really close mimics of peroxidase enzymes
5308886 by knowing the mechanics of the reactions we can fine tune the catalysts for even better performance
5308887 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5308895 there are also some women who have made the decision to stay at home just like my wife whos my home anchor and i would have loved to see some things done for them
5308896 hes encouraging people to get married and hes giving out more bonuses and everything so i guess itll probably wake some of the singles up
5308897 for the first time you get a sense that these measures are taken on board as a result of direct input from the women who know what the challenges are and what some of the proposed solutions would be
5308898 we need to ensure that the young are with us so its not just about technology technology is a medium but we need to use whatever medium we have to let the people understand the issues

5308901 integrators who get the news from both traditional sources and the internet are a more engaged sophisticated and demographically sought after audience segment than those who mostly rely on traditional news sources integrators share some characteristics with a smaller younger more internet savvy audience segment net newsers who principally turn to the web for news and largely eschew traditional sources
5308902 notably radio news also is an important element in integrators news diet nearly half of integrators 46 listen to news on the radio during a typical day while the internet is the main news source for integrators during the course of the day about as many in this segment rely on radio news as tv news during the day 32 radio vs 36 tv news

5308914 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5308915 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5308916 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5308917 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5308922 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
5308923 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
5308924 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
5308925 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere
5308926 to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
5308927 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere
5308928 in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
5308929 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off
5308930 so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind
5308931 if the purpose of a tree was not to transport water it would look like the eiffel tower
5308932 it looks like mr french engineer gustave eiffel without knowing it designed a structure that corresponds with our constructal theory
5308933 diese zukunftsinvestition bildet den grundstein um direkt an der spree im neuen campus wilhelminenhof der fhtw ein center of computer game studies zu etablieren denn die forschung im bereich der computerspiele muss intensiver und interdisziplin rer als bisher werden

5308939 adding a thinner sentryglas helps us expand the range of applications we can serve
5308940 beyond storms people worry about intruders home safety and health and energy efficient living sentryglas can make a big difference in all these areas
5308941 laminators and window companies wanted a thinner grade of sentryglas to help replace thicker constructions using pvb
5308942 they report that more and more architects and engineers are asking for sentryglas and looking for thinner choices to meet a wider range of protection needs
5308943 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5308944 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
5308945 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area
5308946 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the mab project
5308947 it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us

5308963 im satisifed that i was leading all the way and im qualified for the semi final
5308964 after the 100m i had little time for celebration all i have done is a big sleep and some relaxation i just take it on my own
5308965 that is exactly what i wanted to do i didnt want to give too much away i wanted to save as much energy as possible for the semi finals
5308966 i dont have to defend anything the 2004 medal is mine and nobody can take it
5308967 i am here to shoot for the 2008 medal we are all doing the same trying to shoot for that gold
5308968 its been incredible to watch and it has made a lot of teams sit up and take notice

5308970 weve kind of just been preparing for this all this year chris as well he knew he was going for three
5308971 i suppose you do get greedy in a way but its not wrong to be greedy when it comes to sport all along the focus has been three gold medals so if we came away with one each wed probably be a bit disappointed

5308975 our bowlers did well but we never had enough runs to defend
5308976 i would have liked to bowl first but now that its gone you cannot do anything about it

5308996 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5308997 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5308998 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5308999 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5309000 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5309001 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5309002 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5309003 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5309004 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5309005 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5309006 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5309007 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5309008 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
5309009 hes got this really cool style and im always bugging him that we should do a guys line together

5309014 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5309015 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5309016 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality
5309017 my recent experience of them is that theyre not john le carre graham greene its not that sort of tableau anymore
5309018 as an intelligence officer at mi5 youll be faced with some of the most challenging issues affecting national security today
5309019 the decisions you make will play a major part in our efforts to counterterrorism espionage the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in protecting the u k s critical national infrastructure
5309020 theyre trying to portray themselves as an open inclusive organization thats working for the good of the community
5309021 it does need diverse members of society to be able to access the diverse members of society that they may have interest in
5309022 the service seeks to reflect the broad range of u k society which it serves
5309023 rogues are doing just fine i think the crux will be how the changes in hunters mages and warlocks work out pve based we still do crazy damage if we are specd right so thats not changing but will we be number 1 or 2 on the meters i dont know

5309046 most people have this idea that you can only make bagels with new york city water
5309047 i just remember we were all so excited to buy fresh bagels in a bread like package
5309048 ive had visitors come from the states and say its better and fresher than the ones theyve had
5309049 one of our chefs called up and asked can you do poppy seed bagels
5309050 no one is going to get a poppy seed bagel in beijing

5309056 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than would typically be the case
5309057 the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish
5309058 well see some alleviation of the inflation pressures and having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps
5309059 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5309060 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son

5309063 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever

5309068 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
5309069 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high

5309072 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
5309073 oil demand growth will be on the decline in 2009 which will make the world demand growth the lowest since 2002
5309074 demand is coming from emerging markets as long as the united states doesnt collapse it doesnt really matter if the mature economies are slowing
5309075 while oecd demand could still surprise us on the downside non oecd prospects particularly for china and the middle east gulf could be subject to upside adjustment
5309076 add in customarily ever changing sentiment over iran and it looks too early to cite definitively a sea change in the market
5309077 we continue to stress the supply uncertainty thats out there the events over the past week in georgia and turkey have only reconfirmed that
5309078 commodities continue to fall off a cliff and the market likes it

5309089 statistics taken from the montreal herald giving the individual weight of the canadiens indicate that the nha pennant winners probably are the heaviest hockey team in the world
5309090 i do not expect my team to have their feet tonight because of the long trip they have just finished
5309091 they will be in fighting form by tuesday however and we have not the slightest doubt of the outcome of the series
5309092 skimmed over the ice like feathers floating down an airshaft
5309093 whenever the whirlwind forward for the frenchmen hooked his stick on the puck happy holmes folded his arms closed his eyes and prayed
5309094 when the speed boys from the east got through with the home lads you could only recognize them by the s on their uniforms
5309095 in the language of the street they blew the goalkeeper leaked like a fork
5309096 my team got all the bad hockey out of its system saturday night
5309097 five of my men were on the team which beat the canadiens out of the nha pennant in 1914
5309098 foyston walker carpenter wilson and holmes beat the frenchmen then and they ought to be able to do it again
5309099 show up those frog eaters tuesday night if he ever showed up a team in his life
5309100 there were not any eight ounce gloves or padded rings but there was plenty of mixing just the same
5309101 the brand of hockey those lads play is as clean as the bottom of a parrots cage tuesdays contest wasnt a game it was a crime
5309102 if happy had nailed a six foot fence across his nets the montreal forwards couldnt have had any more trouble slipping the puck through for scores
5309103 last night holmes was stopping them with everything from his toe to his eyebrow fending off shots from every angle and guarding his goal like horatius watched the bridge
5309104 the boys have found out that they havent any walk away and they are going to knuckle down to business now
5309105 i do not think montreal was deprived of fridays game by any action of the officials
5309106 and for that reason i cannot allow the protest the seattle players were in the lead all the way and they got none the worst of the refereeing
5309107 seattle fans are unable to see how the canadiens can win from the dashing metros
5309108 in the last two games the seattle puck chasers have so far outplayed the canadiens that nothing but a drastic reversal of form by the mets or a wonderful revival of form by the canadiens would make it possible for the montreal men to win
5309109 does not contain language adequate to describe the fervor of the fans
5309110 the mets went through the invaders defense like a tornado on wheels in huckleberry time
5309111 gone where the woodbind twineth and the grass is ever green and lalonde and his gladiators chests have receeded and resumed their normal position on their backs
5309112 we will reaffirm the commitment in bucharest and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
5309113 i think the allies are going to be firm that this was a violation of georgias territorial integrity
5309114 spending time with the womens volleyball team is pleasant im sure
5309115 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5309116 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5309117 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5309118 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5309119 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed

5309127 a user reports that certain ingredients can be found in a store and comments on the quality of those ingredients we then take everything we know about those ingredients to create a profile of the store this allows us to recommend ingredients that have not been directly reported there and give users a more complete picture of the stores merchandise
5309128 we know that most of the ingredients in a store will never be reported
5309129 so it is important to be able to use the reported data create more information from them and returns a more useful set of information back to our users
5309130 essentially we are trying to apply a higher level of intelligence to recommending stores by not just keeping track of individual items that are recommended but by building an understanding of what aspects of each store are strong and which are not
5309131 we were really focused from the very first point we really wanted to win and we knew this was a really tough tournament but we never gave up we had to be focused
5309132 the olympics is truly about participation but its also about your moment in time today my moment in time was with my sister who i love almost more than anyone in the world its just amazing to think that we could participate and bring home a gold medal and i am so excited i cant even speak
5309133 to be honest it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister i mean we are practically joined together its really unexplainable i have chill bumps
5309134 i decided to resign today and i will send my resignation to the speaker of parliament house
5309135 i have consulted all legal experts and my political supporters with their advice i have decided to quit
5309136 unfortunately some elements prefer personal interests to national interests they leveled baseless allegations against me they deceived the people
5309137 they never thought that although they would succeed against mebut they did not realize they will cause damage to the country
5309138 u s policy should be about protecting our vital interests and who rules south ossetia doesnt make the list
5309139 we need to charge forward and have an overarching policy that is no less vigorous than these cities

5309142 rick did an amazing job of asking the questions most of us would ask the candidates if we could
5309143 i just really liked how john mccain gave well stated answers he didnt even have to think he takes a stand barack has a charming personality he didnt always give the direct answer
5309144 i think obama did very well and he doesnt need to win a majority of this audience he merely needs to keep mccains support below typical trends but this was mccains best performance in memory for the first time i can think of in 08 at least he comes across as the kind of guy a lot of conservatives can want to vote for rather than merely settle for
5309145 but i also think that its worth noting that but i suspect he may be riding high for a while after tonight
5309146 obama wasnt just bad but that mccain was very good
5309147 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5309148 wir wollten den spendenrekord aus dem letzten jahr brechen das hat leider nicht ganz funktioniert aber wir sind auf dem niveau des letzten jahres

5309151 me parece bien interesante dentro de la reforma el planteamiento del art culo 16 que se refiere a crear una regi n mar tima y darle una connotaci n interesante como estado distribuirlo pol ticamente y las islas que antes se manejaban como un todo ahora est n manejadas por regiones
5309152 eso va a permitir que se desarrollen las islas y los puertos diversificar el mar y lo m s importante es que se comienza a saber para qu se quiere una armada cu l es el concepto de seguridad y defensa que tenemos que manejar y c mo es el control del tr fico mar timo
5309153 ahora la nueva ley abre un espacio para una medida de expropiaci n m s r pida por parte del gobierno nacional
5309154 el gobierno pudiera plantearse que ni siquiera requiere de la declaratoria de utilidad p blica por parte de la asamblea nacional cuando decida concretar una medida de expropiaci n contra una empresa
5309155 esta medida representa un serio peligro para el desarrollo de la marina mercante venezolana
5309156 esta situaci n nos coloca en desventaja frente a otros pa ses de la regi n para impulsar el crecimiento de buques con bandera nacional y al final es un costo que se traslada a los precios de los productos que se transporten en estos buques

5309163 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5309164 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5309165 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5309166 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5309167 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5309168 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5309169 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5309170 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5309171 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5309172 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5309173 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5309174 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5309175 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5309176 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5309177 our daughter tess was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma a rare liver cancer last september
5309178 she was only seven months old then and we were really scared but throughout this whole ordeal shes shown all of us that shes a fighter
5309179 we came up with the beer pong idea because its such a popular game especially here in the northeastern united states
5309180 then we simply got online and found collegebeergames com where we could buy some beer pong tournament to raise money it might sound crazy but we think itll be fun and raise awareness in people who might not have ever thought to donate to cancer research
5309181 i have to admit i thought it was a little odd at first because this game is simply about having a little fun
5309182 but why not support a great cause while having a good time
5309183 after learning about this story you really cant help but root for tess and all the other people who are dealing with this disease im actually honored that collegebeergames com has gotten this opportunity to contribute to this great cause
5309184 nobody is going to beat them no way its just not going to happen
5309185 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5309186 going against greece and going against spain it was really easy to get up for
5309187 and we could have easily came in and had one of those games where we make excuses but we didnt take a step backwards today and that was good it was really good
5309188 can you disclose what the icr interest cover ratio is on your senior debt facility
5309189 you are probably the only company in the entire infrastructure utilities space that wont disclose that
5309190 we havent progressed that at this stage we will not be addressing that issue in the next two weeks
5309191 you can sell anything it depends upon whether the price is acceptable or not
5309192 in june 2008 the babcock amp brown board engaged kpmg to undertake an independent review of its impairment assessment process

5309197 online marketers and search engine experts were among the first advocates of our prweb service as it championed the online press release as a way for organizations to get their news to millions of potential customers
5309198 now that prweb has been used by more than 40 000 organizations this is a fun way to stay connected to some of our most loyal users

5309201 dont worry this bag has been sanitized for your protection
5309202 this bag has been known to improve some peoples love lives
5309203 i think ill stop by starbucks and have a triple frappechino latte with foam whip cream and cinnamon while im waiting for you to get up here
5309204 i knew i shouldnt have taken my wifes anniversary present as a tax deduction
5309205 we would ask you to use this opportunity to make it clear to the government of sudan that turkey does not nor will ever support impunity for such crimes
5309206 advance to nearest railroad and pay owner twice the rental
5309207 but even you had have caught that train it wouldnt take you to eastbourne anyway
5309208 i must do not miss this exam no one can do this to me
5309209 so whats it for floating well discs are beyond my experience
5309210 aha my admiration for elyas grows ingenious but not very defensive i suppose it might frighten a few off though a mage locked door to a stairwell would be just as good eh a mode of transport is what we have here wonderful i have read about temporary varieties ahhh discus telekinesis i think i believe they are reformed air elementals practically harmless i wonder if it can be removed that would be something
5309211 hold my arm i want to see if it will bear my weight
5309212 this is like placing yourself into the hands of a sorcerer willingly and we all know what dentiata was like
5309213 we must not underestimate elyas i will take each of you down one at a time and since you are here ahh nieuwode
5309214 you are a rude man miklos i have not lost my faith but your wits seem to have departed from you
5309215 have you considered what you will meet at the bottom
5309216 perhaps there is a secret tunnel we have overlooked you are wise in these structures what do you see feldard
5309217 no tunnels to be found how deep would you reckon this shaft is with enough rope i could likely climb my way down
5309218 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5309219 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5309220 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5309221 no moaning no whinging wanna see all the ravers binging
5309222 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5309223 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5309224 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5309225 its clear from our results that more research needs to be done into the effects of stereotype threat in uk medical schools and in fostering positive educational relationships between all students and their clinical teachers

5309230 la carrera de hungr a demostr lo impredecible que puede ser la f rmula 1 y sa es una de las razones por las que es un deporte fascinante est claro sin embargo que a n estoy en buena posici n para luchar por el campeonato del mundo y ese sigue siendo mi objetivo
5309231 2007 fue muy intenso y la consistencia era muy importante este a o los resultados de todos han sido m s variados y todo piloto que ha ganado una carrera tambi n se ha visto incapaz de conseguir puntos en al menos otras dos ocasiones
5309232 eso hace que conseguir buenos resultados sea a n m s importante pero creo que veremos que la consistencia se hace crucial a medida que avanzamos hacia el final de la temporada
5309233 mejorando y aprendiendo m s del equipo y del coche en cada carrera
5309234 mi objetivo para la ltima parte de la temporada es ganar m s carreras y estar habitualmente entre los primeros es algo que he podido hacer algunas veces en la primera mitad del a o pero ahora me siento m s seguro de poder estar regularmente entre los primeros en las pr ximas carreras

5309255 the whole thing was incredible malcolm got up there and thanked everyone for coming and told them we should think of his fund raising event as being like an ipo an initial public offering
5309256 he said we should get in early because then it doesnt cost as much the longer you wait to get in he said the more it will cost you and if you dont get in at all then it will be painful after november after the democrats win the majority
5309257 then he referred to bronx state sen jeff klein about four times as his enforcer who is going to be brutal aggressive about collecting the contributions and that he was the one managing the ipo

5309297 the theme for this years education week is the journey of lifelong learning
5309298 it was selected to emphasize the importance of continuing to learn throughout our lives and the blessings that flow from it
5309299 our theme is teaching and learning the gospel of jesus christ both in the classroom and at home all of us leaders teachers missionaries and parents have a lifelong challenge from the lord to both teach and learn the doctrines of the gospel as they have been revealed to us
5309300 education week provides an opportunity for inspiration and personal growth with nearly 1 000 classes on education family and marriage relations finance religion self improvement and scores of other topics as well as specific classes for youth
5309301 we typically have 6 000 evaluations completed in class and then there are online evaluations its a lot of reading of student comments seeing how we can improve next year
5309302 each presenter is cleared through the church board of education and ecclesiastically as well
5309303 they are cleared through the university and any new presenters that are wanting to teach send us their materials video tapes and dvds we view them and their proposals and in january we extend our invitation to presenters
5309304 really adds a great safety net to our program it takes time but it is a tremendous benefit

5309313 a large number of israelis have no idea what palestinian society is
5309314 the palestinians are less ignorant about what takes place in israel because they have been occupied by israel for more than 40 years
5309315 but they also dont know the history and dont understand why the jewish people had to establish their own state following the holocaust
5309316 they are negotiations between a weak israeli prime minister and a palestinian president who said does not speak for most of his people

5309352 youve only been here a couple weeks her name was donna
5309353 no not like that see donna has or rather had similar qualities to steves mother both smoked a lot and had trouble with leakage
5309354 steves mom had a bladder problem and would you know occasionally leak
5309355 actually hes been out of town on business for the last few days they got a hold of him around 1 am and he caught a red eye out of baltimore
5309356 steve asked her to look after donna while he was out of town
5309357 a little banged up but i heard but nothing compared to what happened to donna
5309358 most stay together for maybe three years and then move on to one whos usually younger
5309359 boy when he first laid eyes on donna it was love at first sight i knew they would be together for a good while steve wasnt going to let her go for anything

5309376 one of those stars above is vega and the other is regulus like those two stars our futures lie on different paths because of this it would be pointless to continue going on as we have been
5309377 so you would just throw away everything weve been through because of what the future may or may not hold
5309378 so you would be willing to forget the past just like that
5309379 the further we progress into the future the more irrelevant the past becomes
5309380 the past is what shapes the future in a year who knows where we will be but for now just for a little while lets take pleasure in the moment

5309396 this young couple were killed at the home they shared in newcastle thousands of miles from their families and the country of their birth
5309397 they leave behind distraught families and uncomprehending friends and no amount of speculation concerning their online activities should be allowed to obscure the fact that this was a happy young couple who had their futures snatched away from them
5309398 the evidence showed khan was a committed and active supporter of al qaida ideology he had extensive amounts of the sort of information that a terrorist would need and use and the international contacts to pass it on
5309399 the prosecution case was that aabid khan was the link between sultan muhammed and hammaad khan police found the three had computer files and discs books documents and videos as the tools of their trade terrorism
5309400 there were not only items of propaganda but practical guides on making explosives and poisons and a particularly chilling step by step video guide of how to make a suicide vest
5309401 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5309402 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5309403 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaida and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him

5309468 its 11 players versus 11 its a team thing when things are going well it is the whole team and it is the same when we lose
5309469 it is not just about the defence it wasnt individual mistakes it was collective one
5309470 the team wants to get the ball down and pass it those who werent in the original squad have already hooked on to that message from george burley and that is to play good football
5309471 weve got a young squad of the original 24 18 were 26 or under but when it comes to world cup qualifiers youve got to have the experience to get you through to those major tournaments

5309486 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5309487 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5309488 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5309489 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5309490 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5309500 its unthinkable to ask the government to force the church to abandon one of its sacraments to appease a radical anti religious agenda yet thats what this activist group did
5309501 according to italian law the demand to remove a name from the register must be made by an individual with a personal interest rather than by a private association such as the uaar
5309502 also it was easy to demonstrate that the group had no legal leg on which to stand

5309527 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5309528 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5309529 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5309530 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5309531 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5309532 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5309533 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
5309534 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work

5309606 children while it doesnt occur often are probably the most vulnerable just because if someone steals my childs identity they can use that for 10 to 15 years before they the child apply for a loan and they find that their credit is really not good
5309607 we dont ask for age in our identity theft surveys
5309608 our self reported anecdotal data indicates that about 5 percent of the complaints last year were for people 18 and under
5309609 many people find out after theyre over the age of 18 that they were victims of identity theft when they were under 18
5309610 the conventional wisdom is that its about 500 000 people a year who are children who become victims of identity theft
5309611 what most people do not understand is that credit issuers may not have a way to verify the age of the applicant
5309612 the information on the application is typically taken at face value this is particularly true with telephone and internet applications
5309613 a child should not have a report unless someone has started to apply for credit using that childs social security number
5309614 if you ask for a report for a child and theres no report thats the best result because if there is no credit history there wont be a fraudulent account opened
5309615 its highly unlikely that the lender will open an account if there is no credit history
5309616 if we get a request for a credit report that has a birth date that belongs to a minor we will not provide a credit report
5309617 receiving a preapproved credit card offer in your childs name might upset you as a parent
5309618 however it might only be an innocent marketing tool sent by an affiliate of your bank because you opened a college fund for your child
5309619 if you are told that there is no credit report this is probably not a case of financial identity theft
5309620 sometimes it takes getting to that point being in a homeless shelter
5309621 these people didnt even know me and they took me shopping for clothes good clothes not ames clothes they took me to jc penney so that i could go to work they took me to a very nice salon
5309622 thats important because my kids had a real hard time in the shelter they did not adjust well to it

5309624 home equity is the greatest reservoir of wealth american families have
5309625 homes are a very special kind of wealth its not like a diamond which you dont have to replace you have to replace where you live
5309626 people who bought houses in the 60s are really in trouble today
5309627 theyre paying such high amounts for utilities most of these houses dont have an inch of insulation
5309628 we have five holes in the roof it rains in the living room it rains on the porch its a nightmare

5309630 a lot of older people have died and their children cant afford to take care of the property there are some who already have lost their place

5309632 i thought shari will have a home of her own and i will be sure she is doing ok before i pass away
5309633 shari will always work and pay her bills she writes everything out and plans everything she just doesnt up and do anything on the spur of the moment
5309634 for many years ive only had three dreams to get married to own a home and to have children well one out of three was what i got this book chronicles the evolution of my house during construction
5309635 i had tons of money saved so i thought i had 30 000 cash
5309636 dont worry ill find a way to get you the granite countertops
5309637 she came off as being very sweet honest and nice if she hadnt been i probably would have passed
5309638 she was great in the process she asked for help in every phase if i had to do a little freebie here or there it wasnt a problem
5309639 i was on a construction loan it got really tense they expect you to roll it over into a conventional loan and the rates were really great but i was unemployed i had to wait
5309640 she explained that her job tended to be like that
5309641 i didnt move in right away because i thought i would have to sell the house
5309642 i dont have everything i want but i have everything i need ive been given a fantastic gift from my mom and i need to take care of it as long as i have a job im fine
5309643 i had a chance to dig into my memory bank and talk about a few things i havent talked about in years

5309658 weve built up a little bit of a rainy day fund and it is raining in california right now as far as governance goes
5309659 our board used some good strategies in regard to building up a reserve
5309660 we are working a great deal in regard to staff development with all of our teachers
5309661 it will allow us to improve our curriculum analyze student test scores more thoroughly that sort of thing
5309662 it eventually will allow for parents to get real time attendance and tentative grades but not yet
5309663 we are in a decline and its going to go on for probably another six or seven more years
5309664 we havent touched any of the services that directly impact kids so far
5309665 if these kinds of cuts continue eventually we will but not yet
5309666 each year i say there is no way we are going to lose another 500 but we have stayed pretty true to that over the last four years

5309670 that the legislation could be interpreted more broadly to protect fetuses that were not yet viable thus threatening roe v wade
5309671 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5309672 there is no way that the bill would have had any effect on any method of abortion
5309673 the most stable unit in society right now is the family and that is based on a marriage between a man and a woman it has been that way for thousands and thousands of years its the best way to raise kids its that simple
5309674 this amendment would essentially enshrine discrimination into the constitution a perfect example of state sponsored discrimination
5309675 once you start that game why is it two people why cant it be more people why cant it be animals you destroy the institution

5309716 den teori man haft er at man skulle hente s meget olie op s hurtigt som muligt og l gge gevinsten i en oliefond
5309717 det meste af den norske olie er solgt da prisen p olie var lav hvad man ikke har gjort er at spare oliekilder til b rneb rnene
5309718 hvis man ikke var g et s aggressivt frem havde man kunnet opretholde en produktion meget l ngere

5309720 when from march to may russia imposed an escalating series of import restrictions first on wine vegetables and fruits then on sparkling wine and brandy finally georgian mineral water at the time one of the countrys most important exports
5309721 russian authorities denied basic rights to many of the detained
5309722 including access to a lawyer or the possibility of appealing the expulsion decision taken against them most were given trials lasting only a few minutes georgians were held in sometimes appalling conditions of detention and in some cases were subjected to threats and other ill treatment two georgians died in custody awaiting expulsion
5309723 that columns of russian tanks and troops had crossed georgias sovereign borders the thousands of troops tanks and artillery amassed on our border are evidence of how long russia had been planning this aggression
5309724 how do we do this better when we do it in fallout
5309725 oh we always wanted to do this in the elder scrolls but now were doing fallout well just put it in fallout
5309726 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5309727 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5309728 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5309729 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5309730 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5309731 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5309732 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5309733 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5309734 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5309735 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5309736 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5309737 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5309738 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5309739 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go

5309766 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

5309779 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5309780 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5309781 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5309782 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5309783 would be obliged to defend poland in case of an attack with greater speed than required under nato of which poland is a member
5309784 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
5309785 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to nuclear attack one hundred percent
5309786 russia would appear to have few options for punishing poland a member of both the eu and nato with a far larger military and economy than georgia but after last week it would be foolish to underestimate what vladimir putin can accomplish with limited military and political resources
5309787 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system
5309788 it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack giving the usa a permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance
5309789 it clearly states that we can use nuclear weapons against the countries possessing nuclear weapons against allies of such countries if they somehow support them and against those countries which deploy other countries nuclear weapons on their territories poland is aware of it
5309790 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
5309791 constitutes an important step forward in protecting european nations from a growing threat missile attacks from states like iran
5309792 i was disappointed in russias reaction to the announcement threatening attacks against poland a nato ally is a wholly inappropriate response to an agreement that is not aimed at countering russia rather than exchanging charges over missile defense i would urge moscow to comply with the ceasefire in georgia and immediately begin withdrawing its forces from sovereign georgian territory
5309793 im glad that the thing is finalised now there are so many weapons on the planet that the earth could be destroyed 10 times over its obvious we dont need a new arms race but in the end im in favour of the shield the pros for polish security outweigh the cons its good that the americans will be here
5309794 ready to give both europe and america access to its missile warning systems
5309795 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5309796 the coalition has decided that i am part of the problem and not the solution
5309797 i could fight back and answer back but that may have led to deepening uncertainty
5309798 no one knew us no one spoke to us and no one listened to us now we have put pakistan on the map and people take notice

5309800 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5309801 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5309802 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5309803 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5309804 highlights the need for international fact finding missions in georgia
5309805 ongoing militia attacks and a growing humanitarian crisis also indicate the urgent need for the deployment of a mission to enhance civilian protection
5309806 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5309807 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5309808 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5309809 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5309810 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5309811 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5309812 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership

5309838 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5309839 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5309840 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products

5309843 i dont know whether the nfc as the main financier of the project unilaterally pulled the plug on the project amidst allegations of misappropriation of budget funding by the producers
5309844 it is a lie and i think the story was written with ulterior motives to try and destroy our reputation so basically you have to apologize and set the record straight this building is not linked to optimedia secondly it is not linked with any misappropriation of funds that record has to be set straight by new era we are business people who operate on normal business practices and we are following due procedures there is nothing unbecoming in terms of our operation

5309896 russia has finished the operation on halting georgias aggression against south ossetia
5309897 there is a distinction between the understandings of a pullback and a withdrawal in the conversation with french president sarkozy the discussion was about an pullback of forces not a withdrawal
5309898 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5309899 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5309900 assured that georgians would not continue to use military force
5309901 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5309902 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5309903 disease cannot spread over the boundary of clusters which means it will be contained in a single cluster
5309904 thus the best strategy would be making result clusters as small as possible among all the clusters the largest cluster is most important as most disease occurs here and the spread can be broad thus we need to minimize the size of the largest cluster because the total immunization doses are fixed we have to save shots from small clusters to make the largest one smaller intuitively the best strategy for this is to fragment the network into equal size clusters
5309905 egp puts every node in consideration with its neighbors while the targeted strategy only accounts for the individual properties of the nodes
5309906 for an example if you already have a network with a loosely connected large cluster and a highly connected small cluster with high degree hubs egp will use the rest immunization strength to make the large cluster smaller while the targeted strategy will get rid of the hubs to make the small cluster even smaller
5309907 the egp strategy is a fairly new idea and currently it is not used in real world situations yet
5309908 our next step will be to evaluate the strategy in settings where a high proportion of information abort the contact patterns between individuals are known one possible such setting could for example be hospitals where information about the movement of inpatients between wards is registered and stored
5309909 the overlapping missions of health related organizations at mu call for coordination of strategic directions priorities and ongoing activities
5309910 we also want to encourage shared ownership of problems and issues this can best be achieved by creating a consolidated health sciences center led by a single vice chancellor for health sciences

5309937 the servants asked him do you want us to go and pull them up
5309938 no he answered because while you are pulling the weeds you may root up the wheat with them
