2400000 love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day
2400001 i know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones
2400002 i let my big sister pick on me because my mom says she only picks on me because she loves me so i pick on my baby sister because i love her
2400003 when you love somebody your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you
2400004 love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she doesnt think its gross
2400005 by the way i have yet to see any atheist who has not believed what he has for reasons other than what i mentioned and the sheikh has mentioned whether it is kant or dawkins
2400006 i hope this is not going to be about kant

2400008 the comment that the proof for human evolution is irrefutable shows absolute ignorance of science
2400009 nowhere close to facts like gravity nor is it irrefutable
2400010 i know kalam enough to know that his response whatever it be is going to be a lot more nuanced than evangelical christian arguments if hes going to be using kalam in the first place that is
2400011 as for claim that man has evolved from a non human species this is unbelief kufr no matter if we ascribe the process to allah or to
2400012 as for kellers statement being the most authorotative i like your use of the adjectives but again its a claim without any evidence
2400013 if you can handle it please prove beyond a reasonable doubt that human evolution did in fact happen
2400014 again my personal affirmations and negations are really irrelevant what matters is the argument
2400015 and the study of the fossil record is not scientific it cannot be tested
2400016 that is a false claim a theory must be falsifiable for it to be deemed scientific
2400017 there may be evidence in the fossil record for the theory of evolution but it certainly isnt scientific because it cant be falsified unlike other theories that are experimented upon and tested
2400018 so please prove beyond any reasonable doubt that all biologists concur that human evolution happened
2400019 if you can handle it please prove beyond a reasonable doubt that human evolution did in fact happen
2400020 a mere presentation of bones just tells me that something humanoid existed
2400021 any time i am bothered about anything whether its a line thats too long at the bank or a man who doesnt return my love i have to remind myself that these emotional experiences petty annoyance in the former instance heartbreak in the latter are reasonable and discrete unto themselves
2400022 im sick and tired of you people causing all this drama its all immature and i just sit around listening wanting to die
2400023 ai espero que eu nunca fa a isso de novo

2400029 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2400030 awh you looked like a toddler did you break your boo boo
2400031 defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
2400032 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
2400033 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
2400034 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
2400035 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
2400036 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
2400037 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
2400038 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
2400039 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
2400040 i probably prayed more in the first six months than i had in a long while
2400041 when i asked him how hed earned his bronze star he just said doing my job dad
2400042 you can see the pictures but you still werent there to smell it or feel the heat or see the cars burning or what was left of someone after a bomb went off
2400043 i dont think theres anybody who goes over there and fights on the front lines who ever comes back the same
2400044 it was definitely a suicide mission and he said this van full of people came in and they had to quote light it up
2400045 and he said there were children in there and everything i could tell that really really bothered him
2400046 he had a heart of gold and that i think is what killed him because he got into something so outrageously different than his basic makeup and he just couldnt get over it
2400047 he was a good looking man tall blue eyes blond hair smart funny and kind a sensitive guy and a man in uniform that whole thing
2400048 it worked out very well because he was an old soul
2400049 hed seen a lot of things for his young age
2400050 from the beginning since i met him he cried very easily and i thought oh hes just sensitive but then it got worse
2400051 he told me he kicked down over 1 000 doors
2400052 he was the lead guy the first one to go in and most of the time it was the wrong place there would be terrified old people and little kids sitting there
2400053 going to get rid of himself because he was a monster like saddam
2400054 he would just get so distraught over his job and the things hed seen
2400055 he was morally opposed to putting more young men into that situation where they could be injured or killed or see the things hed seen
2400056 it wasnt that he was lazy or not working its just that he was not getting recruits and being punished for it constantly
2400057 you could come to work as motivated as you wanted but as soon as you passed the threshold of the doorway itd suck the life away from you looking around youd see miserable people
2400058 they tell you thats why your buddy in iraq doesnt have a full battalion because youre letting him down
2400059 the pressure recruiting puts on you wears you down so badly
2400060 we often said that wed rather be in iraq than recruiting its true
2400061 the psychiatrist told him he had depression and ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and said he would send him a referral for a psychiatrist and therapist in houston but he never did
2400062 he needed to have a break period he needed to be removed from his position and get treatment
2400063 i dont think aron let the army down i think the army let him down
2400064 i think that the care wasnt there that he really needed
2400065 its amazing that two people so volatile could get together like that
2400066 i dont know if they were trying to rescue each other to keep each other from committing suicide but it turned out to be the worst combination they both needed help so badly
2400067 i went to the wizard today she told me that i need to get out of the army and my job sucks i could have told her that but anyhow i will be alright
2400068 seemed to be upset because she was not paying as much attention to him as he thought she should be
2400069 she was beating on the door like she was going to knock it down
2400070 as much as i loved him i knew i shouldnt be in that relationship
2400071 he said i dont know what to do i dont know what im going to do
2400072 andersson finally agreed to go spend the night with a friend
2400073 id been hoping and praying of course that it would never happen and then when it did there wasnt any shock i mean it wasnt shock it was just your worst nightmare
2400074 and thats when i overheard the major ask him how in the hell could he shoot himself
2400075 i knew about her and that he had moved in with her
2400076 i had never met her and id never talked to her before either
2400077 i understood the hospital was going to hold her for 24 hours because she had mentioned suicide
2400078 seek recommendations from medical professionals and work diligently to implement these recommendations
2400079 we still feel and grieve the loss of sgt andersson a brother in arms whose tragic death still causes us to ask questions to which we may never know or fully understand the answers
2400080 this is the first thing i think of every morning when i wake up
2400081 ive cried more since aron died than i have the 52 years behind me
2400082 i blamed him for a long time i actually told his dad i wanted to burn his stuff because i thought my sister just didnt need to meet somebody with such mental problems
2400083 now learning about his sickness i dont blame him i feel bad for his family because his familys in pain
2400084 i suffer too every day and theres a bond there

2400091 a redeemed heart occupied with god expressing itself in adoration and thanksgiving worship then is the occupation of the heart with a known god and everything which attracts the flesh and its senses detracts from real worship
2400092 the word worship actually goes back to an old anglo saxon word which had in its root form the idea of ascribing
2400093 for to worship is to quicken the conscience by the holiness of god to feed the mind with the truth of god to purge the imagination by the beauty of god to open the heart to the love of god to devote the will to the purpose of god
2400094 in him we live and move and have our being
2400095 the word worship is a contraction of an old expression in the english language woerth scipe denoting the ascription of reverence to an object of superlative worth
2400096 our god is a mighty god who is waiting patiently for us to raise our voices to heaven to stop the tide of the anti christian actions in our world today

2400101 it is interesting that you assert that scientific questions are falsifiable in the tradition of karl popper i presume this pleases me because the theory of mans evolution not all aspects of evolution thus becomes non scientific after all claimed historical events cannot be tested in a controlled experiment to see if they happened

2400105 however quantum physicists have long argued that not all events have a cause a point repeatedly made by physicist victor stenger in response to the kalam cosmological argument
2400106 i will also not spend time arguing with someone who says that things can happen for no reason and without anything bringing into existence simply because we will never agree because that undermines the use of logic arguing without logic is a waste of time
2400107 i detect you are trying to get relief from anger rather than being reasonable i do not think you understood what i was doing all i did was to answer how would islam explain randomness and i did i did not write an article on quantum behavior

2400152 you must go all the way inside amanda to the place where you exist all by yourself your parents are not here with you now in this moment you are alone as we are all alone for the moment accept your aloneness it is your surviving self in the very center lives an aloneness that isnt awful anymore it is an aloneness we all share
2400153 fear is of the future amanda and we cannot do anything about the future we have no control over it because it doesnt exist yet there is only now the past and futre may seem very big but the biggest part is always now now is where reality lives and all of your fears amanda are about the future an imagined place
2400154 go where natures most welcoming elements can be felt most intensely and imagine experiencing them alone all for yourself know that you are whole all by yourself
2400155 its not about being special amanda its about being important to yourself
2400156 pronounce your name boldly and know that this is you there is only one you nobody like you a separate person you
2400157 it will feel empty inside until you fill it with things in life that have importance to you now you must think about what things in life you like thats what your name will mean
2400158 it may not be the reality you want but it is the reality you have at least for the moment if aloneness is the reality facing you you must face it back
2400159 thats right amanda breathe in the present an breathe out the past

2400163 my friends and neighbors everybody watched the opening ceremony of the olympics my locality was in a festive mood to enjoy the biggest sporting event
2400164 i admire the arrangements of chinese government for olympics the inauguration ceremony and the stadium where it took place was superb
2400165 the birds nest stadium where the event was organized is amazing its the most unique sporting venue i have ever seen
2400166 the stadium looked like the bride the ceremony was very colorful i liked it very much
2400167 we can enjoy variety of sports at the olympics its after four years we get to see such big sports festival so i wouldnt miss any games
2400168 the olympic fever will run until the last day of the tournament my eyes will be glued at the television sets to enjoy the game
2400169 the concentration of a huge population of nepal is now on beijing olympics
2400170 we have our own reporter at beijing to cover the event we have increased our updates and live reporting to satisfy our listeners
2400171 let us get into conclusions of forming the new government very soon i am very much interested to watch the kickoff ceremony of beijing olympics
2400172 i have not hoped much about performance from nepali players but the olympic fever would last till the last day of beijing olympics
2400173 can you explain to me why justice roxas has to move to the 8th division but justice sabio can stay at the 9th division
2400174 you signed the decision without consulting the rollo and other memoranda you are a justice of the court of appeals you have your own mind you are not a robot you say you do not need the memoranda
2400175 in that decision he roxas reprimanded the gsis lawyers but it was not raised by the parties in their pleadings
2400176 but you are a justice for goodness sake none of the parties raised the issue that gsis lawyers be penalized it jeopardizes the right of the lawyers to due process
2400177 i hope that you have learned from this experience act on your own without relying on the assurances of a colleague
2400178 we must assure the people that we can rule judiciously it is tragic that these things happened at the court of appeals the second highest court of the land
2400179 there will be no end to these bickering and charges and counter charges of bribery of ca justices if your honor do not make the supreme sacrifice of leading by example for the other ca justices by resigning as ca presiding justice

2400183 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2400184 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2400187 we want a total pullout if they will not leave by morning saturday we will implement the law
2400188 we told them that we should honor the joint resolution which indicated that the milf chief of staff had signed a letter directing its forces except for the local milf to pull out and return to where they came from
2400189 the ccch has a proposal submitted to the milf leadership we will set up a joint monitoring team measures are being drawn up what we are more concerned with is the aftermath of this if its repositioning for the sake of repositioning it will only be a cycle
2400190 it may take some time we are doing it gradually and both sides have agreed no more firing of guns
2400191 we are moving out slowly and we are doing it because we recognize the existence of a ceasefire agreement
2400192 there is a ceasefire committee that has to resolve the breakdown of law and order we will act only upon instruction by higher headquarters
2400193 if they will not leave the signal will be given for us to go there but as of now we are waiting
2400194 just waiting for the order to cross the line of departure
2400195 when the go is given we will move forward if they are still there there will be fighting
2400196 we are hoping for the best while expecting the worst let us continue our calibrated response to the situation in mindanao i commend you for showing exceptional restraint despite the heightened situation and alleged provocation from the other side
2400197 the deadline has already lapsed but what is important is they leave the villages
2400198 there will be no end to this if we try to resolve everything through war
2400199 they were asking for additional ammunition why we asked i told them that we have to leave it to the security forces to defend the people and the state
2400200 it is no longer 2000 when we were poised to attack for you
2400201 i invited them for the reason that we want to come up with a concerted effort a unified move and to avoid duplication in our legal case
2400202 the event is free for our valued customers this is a little something we do for them to show them our appreciation for their continued patronage of our products
2400203 the public debates on family planning and population have in fact encouraged more members of the house to make a stand by co sponsoring the measure
2400204 the bill has now a total of 67 authors with 10 of the latest signatories signing up since the start of the second regular session of congress two weeks ago
2400205 this is significant because the bill has now been approved by no less than three standing committees of the house committees on health population and family relations and appropriations the bill will now be transmitted to the committee on rules so it can be calendared for plenary debates
2400206 with the steadily growing number of reproductive health advocates among house members the measure will be finally passed by the house nine years after the first similar bill was filed in the 11th congress
2400207 it should in no way deter reproductive health advocates in congress from pursuing the enactment of a comprehensive rights based and national policy on reproductive health and family planning
2400208 will be enhanced and truly promoted by providing women and couples information and access to the full range of family planning options from the natural to modern methods
2400209 providing only one method to the detriment of all the rest dilutes the freedom of informed choice widening womens and couples choices will help them decide more intelligently on what method to use to plan and space their children
2400210 no no no come on kid give mom and dad a break its saturday
2400211 i am so use to him waking up at 6 30 or 7 00 now i am really hurt that my day will be starting so early
2400212 to give priority to security operations in the armm elections
2400213 what happened to the memorandum of agreement moa between the department of national defense dnd and the comelec limiting the role of the military in the conduct of every poll exercise
2400214 were optimistic that neither the milf nor the moro national liberation front will do anything to disrupt the armm polls
2400215 it would be disadvantageous for the milf to do anything that can affect the supposed peaceful conduct of the armm elections on aug 11
2400216 generally the situation in armm is back to normal so except for minor violent incidents that may occur we do not see any problem during the armm elections
2400217 even low turnout of voters cannot result in failure of elections winners can still be declared even if only few people voted
2400218 what concerns us is not the low turnout but the fact that if only few people voted we will not be able to fully test the system of automated elections
2400219 everything and everyone seems to be cooperating for the successful conduct of the armm polls so we are urging the voters there to go out look and try to use the new voting and counting machines
2400220 we expect many voters to come out and participate in the election because most of the candidates are their relatives
2400221 this is our golden opportunity to restore our peoples trust and confidence in our electoral process our holding of automated elections in armm will more quickly build a foundation for peace and cut deeper inroads for development which is a core issue of conflict in the southern philippines
2400222 with fast fair and accurate elections we can be more certain of political stability in the armm
2400223 holding the automated elections will fulfill the dreams of our countrymen of a true democracy where they would be able to choose the right elective officials and where elections will be fair honest and clean this continues on to the 2010 elections and we will have better elections
2400224 elections are the lifeblood of democracy and so we ask everyone to pray for peaceful elections in armm on monday
2400225 every filipino must work to ensure that the armm elections will be safe and clean
2400226 we should resist all attempts to sabotage the holding of free and honest elections

2400229 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2400230 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2400231 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2400259 the production company is worried conceding that paul vi was not a popular personalitylike the other two pontiffs as a result unlike the previous bio epics which were simply named john xxiii and john paul ii this time around the producers plan to append an adjective to the popes name in the title otherwise they fret the program might not seem intriguing enough for the mass market
2400260 as our view of the past expands and our understanding deepens the merit of paul vi in presiding over the council leading it happily to its conclusion and then governing the turbulent post conciliar phase appears ever greater indeed i would say almost superhuman
2400261 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

2400290 bangladeshi infiltrators have not only intruded into every nook and corner of assam but have already become kingmakers
2400291 the day is not far when the indigenous people of assam both hindus and muslims and other religious groups will be reduced to minorities in their own land
2400292 there is no formal agreement between india and bangladesh and hence the only way to expel such immigrants is by simply pushing them back across the border
2400293 very soon several assam districts will be swamped by bangladeshi muslims and the state will be ruled by a bangladeshi chief minister
2400294 the victims being picked up by the student volunteers are mostly bengali speaking muslims this trend is dangerous to say the least
2400295 we want that all illegal immigrants who entered assam after march 25 1971 be expelled but caution is needed to ensure that genuine indians are not harassed
2400296 it is unfortunate that some parties are trying to dub all muslims as foreigners if that happens even indian muslims in assam would oppose the anti foreigners drive
2400297 we must defeat such designs a foreigner is a foreigner be it hindu or muslim
2400298 we are against providing shelter to any illegal immigrant from bangladesh but any action such as pushing back or deporting foreigners must be carried out within the existing legal framework

2400302 i lied im 57 im hiv positive i dont have a job
2400303 hey patric dropping modesty aside ill go straight to the point i am a good looking guy six feet and one good physique blonde light green eyes lots of admirers around phone numbers are being passed back and forth every time i go out clubbing i can easily be mistaken for a model my question is how do i reduce my looks and appeal i mean sometimes i feel like im so goddamn lucky and good looking that it seems so unreal i just like to be normal and average and not somebody that really stands out from the crowd because of my looks
2400304 hey patric drake here i just turned 18 and i like to start a new life and i wanna tell my parents that im gay whats the easiest way to say this should i just spit it out or should i just let them figure this out i am just so worried
2400305 hello drake thats a tough question i can totally understand how you feel its so easy for me to just say hey drake just tell them issue resolved i know drake it takes a lot to really tell them theres this fear that they might not approve or that they will but deep inside it will crashed their heart theres also this confusion going on that you dont want to them to worry about you but i also know drake that you want to assure them that all you really want is for them to know that its perfectly ok to be gay its not really an issue and should not be an issue growing up is tough drake there are so many rough roads that you really need to walk on but believe me drake you are not alone everybody goes through the same situation as you and the good news is years from now you are gonna laugh about this and realize that its so silly to worry about these matters do not worry drake everything will be fine if you feel that you found the right moment and perfect time and that you really want to tell them not because you need to but because you wanted them to know talk to them tell them the truth as truth sets everyone free be honest with them tell them how you feel but also tell them that the reason why you told them is because you love them and that you wanted them to know not because they need to know or they should know or it needs to be known but because thats just simply how you feel at the end of the day drake they will discover the real you that you are their son who only want one thing in this world to be loved

2400308 after fifty years of neuroleptic drugs are we able to answer the following simple question are neuroleptics effective in treating schizophrenia
2400309 out patient clinics should be extended and other community resources developed to care for persons in need of help but not of hospitalization
2400310 drug treated patients tend to have longer periods of hospitalization furthermore the hospitals wherein a higher percentage of first admission schizophrenic patients are treated with these drugs tend to have somewhat higher retention rates for this group as a whole
2400311 patients who received placebo treatment were less likely to be rehospitalized than those who received any of the three active phenothiazines
2400312 relapse was found to be significantly related to the dose of the tranquilizing medication the patient was receiving before he was put on placebo the higher the dose the greater the probability of relapse
2400313 relapse during drug administration is greater in severity than when no drugs are given
2400314 functioned over the follow up period at least as well if not better than the successes from the other treatments
2400315 the findings of a better outcome of patients in developing countries was confirmed
2400316 associated with greater severity of both negative and positive symptoms
2400317 the efficacy of these medications in reducing the risk of psychotic relapse has been well documented
2400318 a reappraisal of the literature suggests a one year post hospital relapse rate of 40 on medication and a substantially higher rate among patients who live in stressful environments rather than earlier estimates of 16
2400319 maintenance antipsychotic therapy is the cure worse than the disease
2400320 an attempt should be made to determine the feasibility of drug discontinuance in every patient
2400321 reality it may be a small percentage who need medication indefinitely
2400322 associated with greater severity of both negative and positive symptoms
2400323 katakanlah kepada orang orang mumin perempuan hendaklah mereka itu menundukkan sebagian pandangannya
2400324 sungguh kepala salah seorang di antara kamu ditusuk dengan jarum dari besi lebih baik daripada dia menyentuh seorang perempuan yang tidak halal baginya
2400325 sesungguhnya termasuk ahli neraka yaitu perempuan perempuan berpakaian tetapi telanjang yang condong kepada maksiat dan menarik orang lain untuk berbuat maksiat mereka ini tidak akan masuk sorga dan tidak akan mencium baunya
2400326 kalau kamu sebagai orang mumin maka bukan ini macamnya pakaian orang orang perempuan mumin itu
2400327 perempuan yang memakai kudung seperti ini berarti tidak beriman dengan surah an nur
2400328 barangsiapa menyerupai sesuatu kaum maka dia itu dari golongan mereka
2400329 janganlah perempuan perempuan melembikkan perkataannya sebab orang orang yang hatinya ada penyakit akan menaruh perhatian
2400330 janganlah perempuan perempuan itu memukul mukulkan kakinya di tanah supaya diketahui apa yang mereka sembunyikan dari perhiasan mereka
2400331 perempuan apabila memakai wangi wangian kemudian berjalan melalui suatu majlis laki laki maka berarti dia itu begini yakni perempuan lacur
2400332 sungguh allah telah mengizinkan kamu keluar rumah untuk urusan urusanmu
2400333 apabila salah seorang isterimu minta izin untuk pergi ke masjid maka jangan halang halangi dia
2400334 jangan kamu halang halangi hamba allah yang perempuan itu untuk pergi ke masjid masjid allah
2400335 apakah kalau dia buta kamu juga buta bukankah kamu berdua melihatnya
2400336 rasulullah s a w pernah menyuruh fatimah binti qais supaya menghabiskan iddahnya di rumah ummu syarik tetapi kemudian menyusuli perkataan dia ummu syarik adalah seorang perempuan yang disibukkan oleh urusan sahabat sahabatku justru itu beriddah sajalah kamu di rumah ibnu ummi maktum karena dia itu seorang laki laki buta kamu lepas pakaianmu tetapi dia tidak melihatmu

2400344 ok come out thats the song we just need to build a few backgrounds
2400345 colleagues beginning today we are adopting an inquirer first policy for our signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts what that means is that we wont post those stories online until theyre in print well cooperate with philly com as we do now in preparing extensive online packages to accompany our enterprising work but well make the decision to press the button on the online packages only when readers are able to pick up the inquirer on their doorstep or on the newsstand
2400346 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor or me or chris krewson
2400347 a stake through the heart of the has been inquirer

2400350 well its like this see my sister was driving me and my friend from work i was in the back seat and my friend was in the front seat we were driving east on 21st st toward franklin when we noticed a white car tailgating us i told my sister to tap her brakes to get them to back off but when she did the car sped around our left into the suicide lane and back into our lane ahead of us where she slammed on her brakes she hopped out of her car cussing and screaming at my sister so i hopped out from the car and walked up to her and tried to calm her down of course she was pissed off and screaming so it didnt really work she said im on my way to the f hospital and you mother f are playing games etc so she was still yelling as she started walking back to her car and i said are you serious you were tailgating us then she turned around and and started walking back toward the car still yelling at my sister that she would f her up i guess my sister rolled down her window enough to try and talk to her so the lady grabbed the window and started pulling it trying to break it so i grabbed her arm and started chewing on it
2400351 yeah and she started yanking away and yelling at me that she was going to call the police
2400352 oh yeah sorry then she reached out and pinched my jugular she said mother f you gonna die

2400360 significantly improve the states ability to submit mental health records to the national instant criminal background check system nics index by changing the state law that previously mandated that those records remain confidential the index contains records concerning criminal convictions involuntary mental health commitments and other events that may disqualify a person from purchasing a firearm
2400361 while those records are not predictors of violent tendencies they give a more complete background of the license applicant the new law allows for information concerning an individuals involuntary commitment to a mental health facility to be provided to the nics index by focusing on this small population of individuals who may pose a safety risk the law will help create a more accurate database of individuals who would be disqualified from purchasing a handgun
2400362 we completely agree that anyone who has had a history of violence should not own a firearm however this bill discriminates against new yorkers with mental illnesses 1 in 5 have such diagnoses and uniquely unfairly and inaccurately singles them out as particularly dangerous studies show that people with mental illnesses are actually 12 times more likely to be victims of violence under this legislation the names of all individuals who have been involuntarily hospitalized would be included on a list to be shared between state and federal government agencies even if they have never had a history of violence we have grave concerns around how such information will be used and shared and believe it unduly threatens normal privacy protections to whom new yorkers have a just right it is also unclear as to how peaceful individuals actively engaged in their recoveries could appropriately get off such a list
2400363 its not possession its not even mental illness i dont even like that term because i dont think these problems would exist if not for people having suffered heinous abuse i think it should be called something else it should have a name that reflects the cause
2400364 the figure of one in 20 is probably lower than most people would imagine many see those with serious psychiatric disorders as significantly contributing to the amount of violent crime in society in many ways the most interesting aspect of our findings is that 19 out of 20 people committing violent crimes do so without having any severe mental health problems
2400365 i think lenders who already own a lot of real estate are going to be more inclined to follow through on this
2400366 it cant possibly make a difference youve brought a pistol to a nuclear war

2400374 the real problem then is whether we are simply being maneuvered into revising the constitution where the purported object is to engage our muslim brethren but the hidden agenda is to enable gloria macapagal arroyo to remain in office beyond 2010 thus seen the proposed agreement is the cleverest maneuver charter change despite several fits and starts couldnt get off the ground and was finally junked by the supreme court now suddenly it enlists the cause of muslim self determination in mindanao and voila the lost cause gains new adherents and builds fresh momentum
2400375 arroyo became president to preside over the dismemberment of the republic
2400376 my uncle fought in a war and all he got for me was this t shirt
2400377 for sure there are genuine ips in mindanao and they are certainly entitled to their ancestral domains but muslim filipinos might be difficult to call as ips unless we classify islam as an indigenous religion
2400378 the agreement again rather creatively extends ancestral domain claims to maritime zones and adopts the language of the law of the sea at this point we sail into stormy waters control over internal waters like lakes and rivers and the territorial sea in international law a band of sea within 12 nautical miles around the coastline is vested in sovereigns and our juridical entity is starting to appear like a state
2400379 the constitution lists only nine items that may be devolved to the autonomous region and says that any powers not delegated are deemed retained by the national government
2400380 to enter into any economic cooperation and trade relations with foreign countries
2400381 participat e in philippine official missions and delegations in international meetings e
2400382 the genuine and historic grievances of muslim filipinos are being used for the cheap workaday politics of greed and ambition

2400384 we are saving time money and resources when we train together and follow the same procedures
2400385 and we have complete integration of our emergency operations center incident command structure and command and control were one of the first command posts in the air force to fully integrate
2400386 this means we can quickly respond to incidents affecting the active duty and reserve wings
2400387 we are almost identical in structure and this allows members to swap out with other shift controllers
2400388 we run 24 7 with a high ops tempo so its critical we have seamless integration
2400389 its easier to coordinate joint operations with aircrews brief them on any plan and ensure airborne operations run smoothly
2400390 we have one of the best flightline video systems in the air force
2400391 our multiple cameras cover the entire airfield which is more than four square miles

2400410 our financial system will remain small dominated by the four main australian owned banks and limited in its ability to provide development funding for the productive sector until we introduce a modern best practice regulatory regime that enforces honesty and encourages widespread investor confidence

2400415 if your one quarterback is tom brady or peyton manning then theres a great need to have him in the game all the time and a significant comfort level with that if thats not the case the real need is that the quarterback position plays in each game to a standard thats high enough for us to win however many quarterbacks it takes to do that if it takes one then thatd be great if it takes two then thats what will do
2400416 the most talented college football team ive seen since i had to do pre draft work on the florida state teams of the mid to late 1990s they had the most guys in the country drafted last year and a couple of nfl general managers have told me they might have more drafted next year they definitely have been in a league of their own in the decade from 2000 on
2400417 its as good a time as any in that we only wanted to play it in the first game and they only wanted to play it in the first game given who the opponent is and the importance we place on conference play what would it be like if we had seven conference opponents and then southern california it would be distracting certainly and perhaps harmful to our intentions within the conference
2400418 not listed on the cavaliers roster but groh said he is still waiting for information before making a determination on browns status
2400419 how we as a conference evaluate expansion is not based on the short term competitive aspect of it but on the longer term positioning and stability aspects of it
2400420 the conference has come under fire from some national and regional critics of late because of the leagues failure to put a team in footballs national championship picture and for a perceived drop off in basketball when the acc expanded it was presumed that florida state and miami would continue their national gridiron success but both teams have slumped in fact the last time the acc produced a national champion came in 1999 when the seminoles defeated virginia tech then a member of the big east in the sugar bowl
2400421 the play clock will be set at 40 seconds when the ball becomes dead however the 40 second play clock will not be used after any of the following events occur a penalty is administered a charged team or media time out measurement change of possession try for point after touchdown start of each period start of a possession in overtime or an instant replay

2400427 im alone in a hallway full of doors i am an idiot
2400428 unit 73 please direct more coolant to the turret roof
2400429 ok lt take your tank over to the firing range for your practice shot
2400430 what the hell tank that start was a bit aggressive
2400431 you know id prefer to considered a soldier and not just a piece of machinery like most people see me it bothers me even in this dumbed down state im kept in
2400432 well could you at least slow down a bit id prefer not to have to deal with the mps
2400433 sir your targets have been set up here are there locations
2400434 calm down private you shout like that on a battle field and someone is likely to take a shot at you
2400435 sir sorry sir im havent gotten used to my ear muffs yet
2400436 private see if you can set up a m1 target up at the three mile mark make it challenging id like to have some fun before the brass get here
2400437 the range is hot you may begin your fire exercise
2400438 i already did the area is clear thank you for having them haul out the m1
2400439 i figured you would enjoy that the first target is a truck at the 500 yard range remember we are supposed to practice using the new magnetic field signature
2400440 i think you should call maintenance over here that shoot seams to have blown my personality inhibitor
2400441 this is lt llyushin my unit is reporting a loss of his personality inhibiter send over the maintenance crew
2400442 be advised the delegation reviewing the experimental round is heading to the range
2400443 ah hell i dont have time to do a damb thing before those idiots get here there aint no way im getting the right fuse for this circuit in time
2400444 the new round is expected to travel at a velocity of at least 110 of the current fastest round this will result in a far more destructive shot i expect you should all be very pleased with its performance and here it is now the excalibur round ladies and gentlemen youre looking at the future of warfare
2400445 my audio sensor is picking up the distinct sound of snoring it looks like general franklin has been overcome with excitement
2400446 shes cute maybe i should invite her out after this is all said and done
2400447 i know that the exercise calls for a shot at 500 yards but we seem to have destroyed that target lets show them what we can do take aim at the m1
2400448 ladies and gentlemen i know that the exersice calls for a shot at the 500 yard target however it seems to have been destroyed instead we plan on firing at a more difficult target three miles down range is an m1 tank we intend on destroying that target if you will turn your attention to the screens you will see the view in our scope
2400449 tank shot through the hill that should be rather impressive
2400450 but what has turned me off about the music selections has been just that the selections blur was pretty disappointing parliament felt way out of place and raekwon was definitely not for me again nothing against raekwon i just think i missed out on that generation of rap
2400451 i think what has happened is that we all realized its a lot more fun coaching in college than it was in the nfl you answer to the president and the athletic director and you very seldom see them unless youre losing too much or youre breaking the rules you are the boss in college i just think we all realize its a lot more fun game the lifestyle is more conducive to a happy normal person as a college coach
2400452 its the whole experience i like going to the softball games and the basketball games and being part of the entire university being on campus and going to events on campus
2400453 is truly the best football job in the nfl it was an easy decision for me
2400454 everything ive done from the time i left the jacksonville jaguars as an assistant following the 2001 season was within mind that when i come back to the nfl
2400455 in my mind it was never a question of if
2400456 one of the best thats ever been presented to me
2400457 the longer i was a college coach the more i got used to it it seemed like the nfl got further away but going back this was always the big challenge
2400458 i had pretty much decided i was going to stay as a college football coach
2400459 the challenge of going to the nfl seemed to be something i was looking for
2400460 no matter how much we like her well break up but until the end our pride will still be left with us
2400461 wa your stature is so good can i touch gt
2400462 you still have no way of initiating a call to a girl
2400463 a deep position which means a lot because last year we had a lot of groin and hamstring injuries now we can throw guys in there and still continue to be successful
2400464 we didnt sit in that room all those hours to make a board to come to the draft day and go all over the place and ignore it weve always followed the board in the past when weve made mistakes its because we didnt go by take the best players not fill a need take the best guy on the board
2400465 there are a lot of formations with two tight ends in jim zorns offense that hell be utilized in
2400466 on our board as our choices at 21 were almost all still there at 34
2400467 could they really be correct while everybody else in the nfl was wrong to leave such great talents untouched
2400468 when the need line crosses the talent line go ahead
2400469 the structure the team has operated under in recent years and is recognition of the valuable role vinny has played this season
2400470 todays washington redskins roster is a testament to vinny and the personnel department being an integral part of our team structure in identifying players whether acquired in free agency the draft or on sometimes very short notice as we made our way through the season
2400471 the teams executive ranks are solid with vinny at the head of the football operation
2400472 maybe its best to have an unknown coach who gets along with the owner and the guy who runs the front office than a big name coach who doesnt
2400473 for the first time in snyders tenure it seems like the redskins have a brain trust thats firmly on the same page
2400474 werent in a position where we were in dire need like we have been in the past when we needed a starter
2400475 after four joe gibbs years in which the draft was a mere postscript to an aggressive period of free agency the redskins will have a flock of saturday and sunday selections for the first time since 2002 the team that couldnt wait to empty its pockets and traded draft picks like cards is conducting this offseason the old fashioned way emphasizing the talent in the college pool instead of high risk acquisitions
2400476 after years of trying to build their team through free agency and trade the redskins seem to have switched their philosophy
2400477 we like our team we have good players and theyre good people so we feel like were in good shape
2400478 we didnt have a big free agent list to go after this year we felt that when you grade free agents you also grade against your own players we felt that as a club we were stronger than many of them
2400479 weve always said were always going to take the best player when that pick comes around everybody says that we mean it when we say it were going to take the best player on the board
2400480 solidifies the redskins wide receiver corps in the short and long term
2400481 adds another blocker for clinton portis and the redskins ground game
2400482 spread out defenses opening up routes for wide receivers downfield
2400483 they did a nice job of trading back they stuck with the board congratulations to the redskins

2400497 one cool fall night my parents left the back door open and my mom heard a noise in the kitchen
2400498 apparently it smelled food and o so it decided this must be a possum friendly spot and came right in the back door and was eating dinner leftovers on the counter
2400499 up until then o had never seen another possum so my dad brought her in to see the intruder to say the least she wasnt impressed my parents had a fun time trying to get the little invader out of the house after that my mom was sure to keep the door closed during dinner

2400504 there will be more chatter during the election campaign as nationals opponents try to draw a link between him and the publication of emails that ended don brashs reign
2400505 but the vexed relationship on show is between key and english
2400506 story that emerged after two journalistic confidantes who went with key on a social spree in the capital earlier this year let loose that key expected english to attempt a coup some day perhaps to wrestle the prime ministership away assuming he gets there
2400507 labour an opening to spin into proof positive that national has a hidden agenda which will result in cutbacks to the tax credits programme and the sale of kiwibank if it takes office
2400508 key and english had already helped create perceptions of a hidden agenda

2400510 life is what it is you wake up with your bra wrapped around your head fall down the stairs and in between the madness called your day something happens maybe its devastating or maybe its hilarious but its all a part of that big taco salad called life whether you pick out the refried beans or the meat is up to you

2400512 mayberry worships that fat idiot rush limbaugh she cant be too bright
2400513 i worship him too well not quite but i am a 24 7 subscriber go mayberry
2400514 its nice to have proof postive that people should not choose a mate at a family reunion
2400515 people who have nothing intelligent to say resort to namecalling
2400516 who would want their name attached to that fat hypocritical drug addict bigot
2400517 why dont you go ask that to any of hk supporters
2400518 and then in your 3rd sentence you resort to namecalling
2400519 youre way too high minded for all of us so go share with those who will appreciate your gift
2400520 i hope you find someone else to and belittle and argue with it seems to make you feel so good
2400521 but perhaps the humor there is a bit subtle for you oo
2400522 or go work for the hillary or obama campaigns please you are exactly the kind of person a conservative right minded girl like me wants representing the opposition thank you
2400523 as a supporter of obamas i find your remark particularly offensive not everyone is a supporter of mccain and the war in iraq and many believe bush as a war criminal me included
2400524 no comment re limbaugh or bush etc but mayberryfan is indeed a wonderful human being decent intelligent nonracist and has a more than adequate sense of humor let me guess you dont follow the fascination thread and havent seen the mayberry amp jo comedy show your loss
2400525 protect themselves from such suffocating madness by taking on with a vengeance the identity implied in the vocational track
2400526 now i see from your position that something bad has happened and what were you making as a what bag boy
2400527 while your doing all the fucking work others are laughing and stand around a fucking spill while your cleaning it up i know your alone for hours at a time its bullshit so you and this girl went out
2400528 yea we had a few days talked dirty on the phone i made a few jokes about working under her i thought we had something
2400529 she stops returning my calls and e mail and all that shit i wasnt harassing her by any means we went out at least times and the first time was awkward and the last few times were longer and we made out a few times
2400530 so after she blew me off a few times i confronted her about it at work and she started freaking out and yelled at me and i yelled at her she started crying and the boss took me up stairs and started saying stuff to me i got mad and i said shit to him i yelled at him at the top my lungs cussed at him and all this bullshit he got really mad his face was the color of a fucking tomato told me to get out of his office i flipped him off got a call and a letter from human resources saying that i was suspended pending further investigation i guess my boss wants to fire me for insubordination and sexual harassment she made up all kinds of shit about me so my union rep is helping me out to the best of her ability but i dont think it looks to good i liked the job though didnt make shit and the career opportunities sucked but it was cool
2400531 you can either have your job back or you can tell your boss to go fuck himself but i can make it all go away ill make that girl whats her name
2400532 i knew a tammy once wasnt much to look at but she gave great head
2400533 all i need you do is successfully get this package to this address
2400534 it has to be delivered in the next two hours if you dont deliver it well you dont get to work for me or come over to my house anymore the good thing is you get to keep the money if you do it well then you get to keep the money as well as five hundred more and future jobs for that pay then your little problem goes away do we have a deal
2400535 those guys will be able to contribute right away theyre not true freshmen anymore theyre more like redshirt freshmen
2400536 we certainly have a highly regarded freshman coming in the fall in mike glennon we want to give a look at him when we get to august so it will probably be a situation that wont be solved until we go into the first game
2400537 took community college classes and cleaned golf carts at a course in houston last fall
2400538 has done some really good stuff i really like that kid right now and i think with this summer to be here and then with an august under his belt thats a guy that has a chance to help us as a freshman
2400539 progressed to the point he should see considerable playing time in the fall

2400545 with the addition of hrp associates to our list of strategic partners we are now able to assist clients in need of content expertise
2400546 getting accredited is a tough job and dr cohen takes a lot of the guess work out of the process because hes been through it several times
2400547 the results of this trial could have significant public health implications worldwide
2400548 weve provided the information but it has to be implemented into a program that works
2400549 were quite relieved in a way that we have this finding and we have a clear directive of what to do
2400550 a the teacher teaches and the students are taught b the teacher knows everything and the students know nothing

2400571 no clever euphemism can hide the fact that these communities are based on a selfish and fraudulent premise the exclusion of children and families
2400572 it took them ages to put in something about golf carts being stolen
2400573 they absolutely focus on what they bill as active living people complain but the bottom line is that i would never leave here
2400574 we bought a house the first 12 hours we were here
2400575 i definitely think that the people out there who are the residents of the county need to know more about whats happening
2400576 theres a lot of great things manatee countys offering its citizens the problem is that no ones told them
2400577 were going to take this information that we have and communicate it to the people to pay the bills
2400578 it is kind of funny how people sometimes theyre so focused on the one area theyre working on they dont realize the significant contribution theyre making for the taxpayers
2400579 a leader who thinks outside the box for creative and real solutions
2400580 it is nonsensical to cut a major local source of funding for our schools and other public service sectors at a time when state allocations are shrinking
2400581 we need to break out of the typical dichotomies weve been working in and get some new creative strategies and for crying out loud why are there not more women at burmese community planning meetings
2400582 less psychologically damaging to the child to let the child decide when it wants to learn how to use the potty

2400609 a nursing co worker was taking an aborted downs syndrome baby who was born alive to our soiled utility room because his parents did not want to hold him and she did not have the time to hold him i couldnt bear the thought of this suffering child lying alone in a soiled utility room so i cradled and rocked him for the 45 minutes that he lived
2400610 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
2400611 consistent with our position last year naral does not oppose passage of the born alive infants protection act floor debate served to clarify the bills intent and assure us that it is not targeted at roe v wade or a womans right to choose
2400612 i brought pictures in and presented them to the committee of very premature babies from my neonatal resuscitation book from the american pediatric association trying to show them unwanted babies were being cast aside babies the same age were being treated if they were wanted
2400613 doctors really dont care about children who are being born with a reasonable prospect of life because they are so locked into their pro abortion views that they would watch an infant that is viable die
2400614 that may be your assessment and i dont see any evidence of that what we are doing here is to create one more burden on a woman and i cant support that
2400615 how are you going to vote on this keeping in mind that 10 15 years down the line your daughters god forbid could be transported across state lines

2400621 our clients can create an application package automatically in under 2 minutes
2400622 as opposed to the days or weeks it can take to compile one manually the goal is to encourage institutions to focus their staff resources on improving the quality of their compliance programs instead of on the technical details of producing their application
2400623 our close working relationship with clients allows us to get great feedback from the people using accreditstation every day to compile their aahrpp applications
2400624 the things we added to version 2 0 came directly from user feedback

2400661 busy as ever i guess you know squalid motels girls with crabs and serious self esteem issues theft bad management fun stuff like that weve been traveling around playing such esteemed halls as rockys rib n roll as well as some of the finer state fairs

2400663 theres not gonna be any advance theres not gonna be any anything they dropped us and thanks for bringing it up youre a real pal
2400664 wait a minute i thought you had a two record deal i thought there was a contract
2400665 well ive learned a lot about the finer points of contract law just lately they released boys in blue the same week as the new b b king see so you can probably guess where the fucking promotion money went they didnt push us at all just left us twisting in the fucking wind they didnt back us promoters wouldnt book us we sold just about enough wax to pay back the producer and the studio and maybe eat a little wendys food and then they dropped us broke out of the contract somefuckinhow and that was it no kiss no nothing just right up the ass and thank you maam nice doing business with you
2400666 yeah nobody has really but they said theyd pick us up get us into some decent clubs in chicago d c new york east coast circuit
2400667 yeah maybe the only shot after all this rca shit blew up in our face chucky and dave started fighting again and if something doesnt break for us real fuckin soon i dont think im gonna be able to hold it together much longer
2400668 and if that happens then im back to washing dishes or cars or whatever and sticking up come fuck me signs in the music store window
2400669 shit so thats why i made this run for you like i said before i dont do this fucked up nerve wracking shit anymore but studio time is expensive man

2400679 john weve been best friends for years you know that but im not exactly seventeen anymore the cops play for keeps these days my balls once made of solid steel have i fear turned to tinfoil you know id help you out if i could but i just cant i appreciate the offer but i just cant keep on risking my freedom and my sanity for a pound of this or that
2400680 just a question old buddy old pal but its actually a trick question because i already know the answer
2400681 what are you getting at columbo whats with all the dramatic buildup exactly what kind of score are you planning here
2400682 im planning how to get your ass into the studio hell im planning how you can buy your own goddamn studio im im planning for your future
2400683 im talking about a little town named miami florida where the sky is blue and the sands are white and where they confiscate so much contraband that they dont have enough room to store it all
2400684 see heres the deal they used to have to keep all this dope around until these rich kingpin types with their fat cat lawyers waited ten years to go to trial right you know that crazy mixed up legal system of ours but not too long ago they passed a resolution that said they dont really have to keep all the dope they only need to hold on to a sample of what they bust the rest gets loaded into a big shiny semi truck driven to an undisclosed location and burned
2400685 and more important than that a disclosed route to said disclosed location my but they sho do take the back roads
2400686 which brings me to ow that fuckin hurts which brings me back to my original question can you drive a semi truck wait dont answer what is yes alex oh and its the daily double
2400687 i do so know that i know because of when you used to roadie for that spandex wearing big hair band what were they called badass
2400688 yeah well they still sucked but you drove the semi didnt you
2400689 you knew all along didnt you before you ever called me i mean
2400690 you knew all about it the band getting dropped everything
2400691 you motherfucker you knew exactly what kind of shape i was in and you lured me back here you could have gotten someone else to bring in your grass but you called me why because you were planning this little surprise all along i dont fucking believe it
2400692 yes i do i do johnny i know you i just dont believe i fell for it you didnt insult me or my mom over the phone that should have tipped me off right there
2400693 yeah and you figured that once i got here id say to myself well frank you did one more so why not two
2400694 did it work have i succeeded in drawing you into my evil schemes or not
2400695 i knew you were a rebel frankie baby but well have to talk about this in the morning ive got to get ready to go to my day job
2400696 yeah well im sorry about that i guess it was sort of fucked up of me to just spring all that on you like that but i knew it was the only way to get you to listen if idve told you over the phone you would have just told me to go fuck myself and been done with it am i right
2400697 well anyway youd better catch up on your sleep while you can cause im thinking wont any of us get much sleep over the next week or so
2400698 okay heres how all this came to pass i know this dude named robroy down in miami they call him that because of his tastes in beverages and sex partners weve done a little business over the years off and on hes a computer hacker you know one of those coffee drinking porn watching comic book reading nerds with a room full of gear he got off stolen credit card numbers so he calls me up about a week ago and hes just shitting nickels seems he was up in the metro dade mainframe and found out some crazy shit you want some toast
2400699 right then anyways he was up in there cause some dude had paid him to get in the system and get rid of some outstanding warrants so after hes done with that hes just sniffing around checking things out when something weird happens all of a sudden he gets shuffled way up into the operating system and hes got access to everything all the crazy top secret kind of shit you should have heard him talking about it man sounded like he was about to drop his fucking tranny you know how those mouse pounders can get hes in there nosing around for hours and he picks up a lot of interesting info including some very interesting trucking info seems they haul this shit on the 15th of every other month thats just over a week from now
2400700 this is big were just a couple of old wo out weed dealers dont you think we might be getting in over our heads here
2400701 yeah right but have you stopped to think out the logistics of this if theyre carting all this shit around dont you think theyre gonna have it well guarded this is miami youre talking about not some podunk little town in west asshole this is tony montana country theyve probably got ten cop cars in front and behind probably got the national fucking guard riding shotgun for gods sake
2400702 they dont though thats the thing its all supposed to be super low profile theres gonna be the driver and one guard in the truck itself and one unmarked car in front that car contains two cops thats four guys all together and the route takes em down some desolate ass roads some of them are almost not roads at all all weve got to do is lay a trap puncture the tires and take them when they stop we subdue the nice officers hitch their trailer up to our tractor and ride off into the proverbial sunset simple elegant
2400703 okay well the driver is supposed to call in every ten minutes if he fails to check in they call out the cavalry
2400704 see its all in the timing we have to set it up so that we grab em as soon as the driver makes that call and then we move fast fast fast and anyway were gonna have robroy riding shotgun so to speak he jams up the radios and stir fries the police network all the cops in town will be panicky and confused more so than usual even im telling you frank this dude robroys the fucking bomb he can do just about anything with those machines i shit you not i wouldnt even get involved with this crazy shit if we didnt have him watching our ass
2400705 no i was just sucking cocks in a gay bar one night and decided to stake my freedom on his punk ass of course i trust him
2400706 i know him we go back a long way almost as long as you and me hes solid everybody involved is solid or else i would have told him to fuck off
2400707 really heres how it breaks down were talking six people im team leader youre the driver jimmy hoskins you remember crazy jimmy hes the guns and the arrangements for the truck amy is lookout and crowd control robroy mans the wires and his uh friend tim handles backup plans as well as robroys ding dong
2400708 this guy tim has an in with the cops he can help throw off pursuit if there is any which there shouldnt be not if we do our jobs right
2400709 youve got this whole thing figured out dont you rambo
2400710 everything pot blow smack guns ecstasy you name it one stop shop
2400711 except for one thing how were you planning to move a whole fuckin semi of drugs do you have that part planned too
2400712 you put so little faith in me even after all this time it makes me sad really
2400713 i said i got a guy okay thats all you need to know thats all its safe for you to know understand me up in detroit you might know his name if i said it which i aint going to do hell youll probably get to meet him before its all over hes a cool guy dont get me wrong but youll understand if hes choosy about who he gets involved with hes a friend but hes bigtime and bigtime means you dont want him on your ass get it
2400714 i dont know if you do anyway thats where amy is up there greasing the lightning so to speak shell meet us down south on friday
2400715 thats a beautiful metaphor johnny youre ahead of your time
2400716 if youre in this thing then youre in it and its dead fucking serious if not cool i understand ill have to find another driver but if youre with me then its definitely for keeps were playing for all the fuckin marbles
2400717 im tired frankie im tired of swinging quarter sacks to every nickle time head in kentucky im tired of the paranoia tired of wondering when the cops are gonna come kick my door in you think i like living this way you think i like waiting tables at the fuckin sizzler i want out of this stupid drug business i want a little security in my life for a change and now ive got the opportunity to do it big and do it right
2400718 i could have been somebody frank you know that if i hadnt spent my youth hustling dope i mean but im fucking 36 years old this september and its all i know well fine so it goes but i want out and if this is what it takes to get myself out then im gonna go for it and nobodys gonna stop me not you not amy not anybody
2400719 so hows it going to be are we men or are we mice is it steel or is it tinfoil

2400727 while east tennesseans have been struggling with out of control gas prices david davis has pocketed thousands from oil companies
2400728 why is big oil trying to buy our seat in congress and why is davis accepting their cash
2400729 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
2400730 and why when gas hits 4 a gallon we have no alternatives
2400731 the confirmed reserve of this field is 1 billion barrels and we believe that it will be doubled after this exploration mission

2400741 to get the message out either before the enemy gets the message out or be able to respond to the enemy as theyre putting the message out
2400742 were just looking to inform our folks well enough that when they say something theyre going to state the facts
2400743 as long as youre aware of whats being said you can always correct the record
2400744 or you can always inform people adequately to ensure that we dont stay on this reactive mode and dont look at our soldiers and our leaders out there and mistrust them

2400749 recent attacks from china on department of defense networks and systems increase the urgency to construct cyber systems
2400750 what should i do with my feelings for this new person
2400751 our understanding of the science of cyber electronics is relatively immature at this point
2400752 it includes the study of both the physical and the virtual
2400753 theres been some tremendous things going on especially in iraq and afghanistan where electronic warfare has helped in the operations and in limiting and reducing the deaths in theater
2400754 cyber electronics could include or have distinct relationships between things that we call network operations network warfare computer network operations space superiority electronic warfare and the electromagnetic spectrum operations
2400755 each represents a different slice of the cyber electronic continuum within which different capabilities must exist
2400756 there is no nation state border where were talking now
2400757 there are nation state sponsors and we have to look at it in terms of nation state sponsors as well as those who are not nation state sponsors i might call them cyber state sponsors who are really developing on their own out there

2400760 but the vacuum surprisingly is not empty there is a difference between vacuum and nothingness take a room and take everything out and take the light out and people out and air out when you think it is truly truly empty it isnt empty it can still contain a substance which is the vacuum which is not entirely empty in some sense
2400761 we think that the masses of particles are a sort of friction with the vacuum
2400762 they do not travel freely with the vacuum but rather interact with it in some way
2400763 how improbable does a catastrophe have to be to justify proceeding with an experiment seems never to have been seriously examined
2400764 conditions identical to the way things were a split second after the big bang
2400765 it is not inconceivable that physics could be dangerous too some experiments are designed to generate conditions more extreme than ever occur naturally nobody then knows exactly what will happen indeed there would be no point in doing any experiments if their outcomes could be fully predicted in advance some theorists have conjectured that certain types of experiment could conceivably unleash a runaway process that destroyed not just us but earth itself
2400766 there have been speculations that future high energy particle accelerator experiments may cause a breakdown of a metastable vacuum state that our part of the cosmos might be in converting it into a true vacuum of lower energy density this would result in an expanding bubble of total destruction that would sweep through the galaxy and beyond at the speed of light tearing all matter apart as it proceeds

2400854 mr bristow im not sure if im interested in your game
2400855 who are you working for precisely why would they want me to work for them since you seem to know so much about me you must know that the reason i was sacked from my last job involved a kidnapping and my throat being slit

2400897 for some reason i dont think that means youre glad to see me
2400898 i think youre just the person i need to see
2400899 whats wrong jack you can tell me were almost family
2400900 and youre looking at me like youre trying to classify me and put me in jars i dont like it vaughn i dont know what youre trying to prove but whatever it is this is the wrong way to go about it
2400901 howd you find out i was here i thought it was top secret i didnt even tell devlin but youre still here im surprised you dont have syd syd sydney in tow telling me that i have to straighten up and fly right
2400902 and your daughters going to kill me the vaughn men are such suckers sometimes
2400903 they did worse than kill you they tore your soul out and jumped on it and laughed
2400904 i dont care how drunk you are thats out of line
2400905 that was out of line in vino veritas but the truth isnt very tactful
2400906 a double on the streetcar line on st charles the ramada
2400907 with a lot of alcohol and even more air conditioning
2400908 i got a few bruises for good measure but she let me go i wasnt important enough to kill or maybe she knew that sydney wouldnt want me dead
2400909 they keep it too cold in here the first week i was here i kept getting nosebleeds from the transition
2400910 im sorry mr vaughn about sydney about what happened to you
2400911 and its not your fault you got the civilian out at least
2400912 i was going to watch this but i think i saw this ep of charmed already
2400913 but yeah rerun season i think theres a movie on amc
2400914 and its cool i was up in the bathroom thinking about how im over him well not over him but i know hes not that i dont want him back
2400915 its okay to still want him though even if you know its bad its not like you stop loving someone overnight
2400916 i dont know if i stopped loving him but when im not feeling alone i know that i dont want to love someone who lied to me someone i cant trust
2400917 you can tell me you know im your best friend right im not going to judge you
2400918 when danny died things got weird i mean everything got weird i did strange things to get over him things that werent exactly smart
2400919 except that the things i did were really really stupid
2400920 i mean really stupid i was like going insane i think i met this guy through a work assignment and i i like him right except it cant work out no way so of course im crazy about him and im thinking about this guy all the time when i run into well she works for a rival company
2400921 i liked it i really liked it dont like her so much but now every time i look at the new guy i think about how good she was at kissing me and thats not what i want to be thinking
2400922 its big and complicated in my head and i think its just stress getting to me its not like youre required to tell me every stop on your bank trips and its not like i remember everywhere you go anyway and thats not really important anyway
2400923 ive been a mess lately and im being a mess again when you really dont need it
2400924 its not like you dont have a reason to be a mess and you are my friend and i do love you and im there for you whatever mess youre in but syd one thing
2400925 je ne fais pas une politique du consensus je fais une politique de la conviction
2400926 and if you havent realized most of the best opportunities for operatives to insert is in a club social setting you have to blend white boy blend even if you cant dance and you cant
2400927 if you were in the middle of a crowded club what would you be paying attention to right now
2400928 why would you need to pay attention to him youve ascertained his position already havent you
2400929 why would he move if he was comfortable this is his territory not yours
2400930 on the dance floor you are a hot eurotrash guy on the prowl thats it your partner will keep an eye on the target you are a brit with connections in hong kong looking for some fine ass your only problem is making sure that your dance partner doesnt decide that your connection in hong kong is jack dont lose the beat
2400931 because thats where sydney is and once you figure out what the fuck is up with rambaldi i know jacks taking you along for the ride that is if he can get the situation with little will taken care of
2400932 sydney is good because she blends nobody thinks a skinny babe is out to steal their data people think shiftless dudes with no real agenda are there to steal their data
2400933 youre attractive fairly young and most importantly you look like the kind of guy whos out to get some
2400934 its not important whats important is that you stay in character because if you dont raise eyebrows no one will ask questions you dont have answers for
2400935 i wore him out using my secret blend of britney kylie and nsync
2400936 were going to sd 6 i think its time you met a few people
2400937 besides i have a job for you that i think will be germane to our projects
2400938 i want you to visit a certain former ally of yours in prison
2400939 are you really going to take me to hong kong
2400940 whats wrong mr wyndam pryce i thought you were looking forward to field work
2400941 however im not sure that i want to get too deeply entangled in another family psychodrama
2400942 but youre not actually getting involved youre simply in a quid pro quo situation wesley you help me i help you
2400943 and of course the fact that youd cheerfully blow my head off if i chose to get un involved in this situation in no way entangles me right
2400944 you and quite a few people i dont trust either
2400945 it seems as if the only people who do like me these days are dangerous people who need me desperately for private reasons they dont share
2400946 i like you because ive been you mr wyndam pryce
2400947 i mean about the distrust you understand how it gets to be a habit
2400948 youll be meeting sydneys partner today dixon and our technical wizard marshall
2400949 so this is the footage and interview they shot of me after the nationals and a little during the arnold classic
2400950 hooked muscle women will hit the airwaves this sunday night at 10 pt and again wednesday august 13 at 12 a m et pt on msnbc
2400951 you wish so you could suck my dick but too bad im not into dudes please do the world a favor and hang yourself you fuckin fag music loving little bitch
2400952 i really dont think the show had the right balance of people on board
2400953 my new policy will be to include a pair of boobs in between paragraphs
2400954 and up til that point you might have actually got a female involved with you even if only here on the net but now its back to another 15 years with mrs palmer for you my boy
2400955 if you were to try and read every single page on the internet all day every day each day you would get 3 years further behind in your goal
2400956 we expected to discover just one or two simple carvings instead we found a breathtaking panel probably one of the most complex discovered in county durham
2400957 there is a gulf of time and civilisation between the society that carved this stone and ours
2400958 its true meaning is something well possibly never understand i am proud that our work has helped preserve this fragile link to our ancestors
2400959 our volunteer recorders have worked alongside experts in the field to develop new techniques to produce stunning 3 dimensional computer models of rock art for display
2400960 these models can be manipulated to show some carvings which are now almost completely invisible to the naked eye and will be a fantastic tool for managing these ancient sites for the future
2400961 the british landscape is thickly scattered with these fascinating and enigmatic works of ancient art
2400962 the online record of the northumberland and durham examples will serve as the starting point for a national survey and we hope help us understand their meaning and lead to the discovery of others
2400963 the indie spirit has been commodified and re envisioned as a marketable lifestyle just like punk alternative and grunge before it pitchforks schreiber said
2400964 but those are all permutations of the same very resilient subculture
2400965 if the last 30 years are any indication after every last cent has been wrung from it itll just burrow back underground and continue on its own terms
2400966 people who came of age in the 70s and 80s punk rock movement seem to universally hate hipsters
2400967 latest coolest hippest bar and listen ing to the latest coolest hippest band
2400968 dont seem to subscribe to any particular philosophy or particular genre of music
2400969 these aesthetics are assimilated cannibalized into a repertoire of meaninglessness from which the hipster can construct an identity in the manner of a collage or a shuffled playlist on an ipod
2400970 i think that the feng shui in this place is bad
2400971 you dont listen to me i dont listen to you its a vicious cycle
2400972 were going out tonight you look like you could use some excitement and your mother agrees with me
2400973 where would i go this place is crawling with your people sark
2400974 i asked the bartender to make something nice and strong for a lady friend
2400975 lets go out there mix with all the nice people my mother has put on the dance floor to protect me
2400976 i would wonder if there arent other good labor union people out there who are devoted to the cause who dont have these problems
2400977 the whole idea of permaculture is to put in as little work as possible and allow nature to find its balance
2400978 im also a big fan of fukuoka author of the one straw revolution if i had the time id love to go to japan and work on his natural farm and learn about his methods
2400979 the amish are the most successful sustainable farmers and they are using early 18th century technologies
2400980 humanoids have been around for at least a million years
2400981 and modern humans have been here maybe 500 000 years the paleolithics were the hunter gatherers and the neolithics were those who were settled in one place and who began agriculture
2400982 when we settled we had to make the effort to force ourselves into the new mindset but our true nature is paleolithic
2400983 now when you had agricultural and cow raising people who lived adjacent to the primitive people the bushmen would rarely die of hunger though the agricultural people would the agricultural people learned to rely on and expect much more when cattle died due to drought for example the agricultural people suffered far more than the bushmen the farmers also had to work a lot harder usually seven days a week whereas hunter gatherers worked maybe three days a week

2400990 if there was snow outside i would get on it err i mean under it
2400991 full of airplanes all of which were laying bombs and then machine gunning on their pull ups
2400992 he tried to turn away from me and flew right through my line of fire
2400993 i saw the rear gunner crumple and the left wing begin to burn so i snapped to the right and climbed to set myself up for another pass

2401005 thou shalt manually wade through gobs of data in a text file means hes no programmer this is also perfectly fine but means hes not the right person to be changing this file anyway
2401006 grown ups and old people think of 4 as first but we know phantom menace is first
2401007 its a tough thing for us and were kind of between a rock and a hard place
2401008 as artists you keep wanting to move forward and play your new material but youre kind of beholden to your success of the past were fortunate in that we have a truckload of bona fide top 20 hits but the other side of the equation is thats all our audience wants to hear
2401009 we try to sneak in a couple new songs as we go but you can really tell the majority of the audience doesnt know them because theres a collective uhh
2401010 you can put a new song in the first two or three or even start with it because while the audience is there and you have everyones attention theyll indulge you but from then on it gets difficult youve got to pick the right new song to play and even then assume maybe 10 people in the audience are going to know it out of 10 000 running order is very important especially for a band like us because our show is very physical and its very up and we dont like to bring it down
2401011 we started off the tour playing six songs from the new album and that very quickly became five songs and then four and then one the single
2401012 that can even happen with what youd hope would be familiar material like this one tour where we started the show by playing the entire side 1 of the high and dry album about 30 of the audience went mad for it but the rest of them were like this isnt pour some sugar on me then we realized that wasnt the biggest album for fans and it wouldve been different if wed opened with hysteria so you cant be too clever
2401013 it was actually an upper respiratory tract infection which was very unpleasant
2401014 weve all been on tour and gotten ill and managed to pull through but with this it got to the point where joe would open his mouth and nothing would come out which for joe elliott is very strange that man is in love with the sound of his own voice
2401015 you know we live in a time where you cant say or do anything
2401016 and where do people find the time i have two small children and three dogs and i dont even have the time to go to the dentist let alone sit on the internet chatting about this s for hours its much ado about nothing
2401017 you have to see it its great the best e var
2401018 really this is the book that got her daughters who never read to read why then they need to read
2401019 a new york city charter school set to open in 2009 in washington heights will test one of the most fundamental questions in education whether significantly higher pay for teachers is the key to improving schools the school which will run from fifth to eighth grades is promising to pay teachers 125 000 plus a potential bonus based on schoolwide performance that is nearly twice as much as the average new york city public school teacher earns roughly two and a half times the national average teacher salary and higher than the base salary of all but the most senior teachers in the most generous districts nationwide
2401020 be kinder than necessary because everyone is fighting some kind of battle
2401021 we are a little perplexed at this point to tell you the truth

2401044 you realize that prisoners at this facility dont get visitors
2401045 i suppose they dont then again im not the average prisoner at this facility
2401046 i see a murderer a thief and an enemy of the united states thats what usually ends up here
2401047 didnt the nice men provide you with a chair it must be uncomfortable standing there and glowering at me especially when you know that i might just have to corroborate whatever suspicions sydney has about you
2401048 i would have done the same in your position i might have even let that beautiful boy walk into the trap but that would have been risky wouldnt it
2401049 the cia is going to bring you back to los angeles
2401050 theyve decided its more advantageous to have you around pending the outcome of your case with the united states
2401051 did they send you here just to tell you that
2401052 then i should perhaps rest and enjoy the amenities of my cell
2401053 theyll take you down if you dont let me go
2401054 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2401055 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2401056 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2401082 yeah i go totally insane and act like a fool the emotions of others take control too strongly and i never know if what i am feeling are my own thoughts or those of someone else i doubt and fear and lose all hope
2401083 stop you just keep fearing losing me and you arent going to you can try pushing me away but it wont work i am not going to let you i love you too much maybe not in the manner youd like i do love you though
2401084 i always knew your inheriting the family powers was going to be a curse on me
2401085 ray told me how good you were at hugs when he first met i never thought i would get the opportunity to experience it since you passed away before we could meet
2401086 i tried to send a warning but my son the super shielded wasnt listening and then when i tried to touch your mind adam was when i noticed roadblocks had been put up
2401087 knew exactly what they were doing the level of magick they were working isnt something you can stumble onto and learn that easily whoever it was they were certainly well trained
2401088 and why didnt i sense anything with all the alarms and traps i have set here something should have given me warning
2401089 his voice trailed off as he noticed natalies bemused look on her face
2401090 but yes ever since then we both can feel each others emotions no matter how shielded we are against each other to prevent it
2401091 makes for interesting times and it is impossible to get mad at the other without feeling a hundred times worse for the wear weve only been short with each other once and it was awful i never want to feel that horrible again ill take the flu with all the aches and fever before i ever want to feel what i felt that morning again
2401092 i shouldnt have snapped at you it was lack of sleep and the fact that you left me alone for three days im sorry
2401093 stop apologizing i am the one who is sorry i shouldnt have said what i did i was being childish
2401094 i am fairly certain i am the one that was behaving like a two year old i know your work sometimes takes you away from me
2401095 and i know how insecure you get at times i cant blame you but i wish you would relise i am not that person the person that helped create those emotions is out of your life and you need to let them go trust me i wont ever hurt you
2401096 are you two always like this or is this a special show for the mother
2401097 i miss moments like this whenever you were lonely or sad youd come to me to make it all better i am glad you have adam now but you are going to have to learn to do it alone too
2401098 i dont wanna i hate being alone i cant handle the feelings i cant handle the thinking i over think and compound issues that in reality dont even exist i create senarios in my head and before you know it i am sliding down a self destructive path to oblivion
2401099 well it is too soon for ewither of you to come join me permenantly
2401100 oh i know the thought has crossed your mind ray
2401101 no i know you arent the type to cast any love spells or such silliness you know what kind of trouble that gets you in i am just saying let things take their course what is meant to be is meant to be it will happen patience my little one
2401102 a while now he felt it was time he has you
2401103 to continue telling his stories now and felt it would be better if he helped another along their path
2401104 i do enjoy your visits but we really should get to the business at hand who was in the garden and why they were heavily shielded i couldnt ect anything about them only watch and not be able to stop
2401105 but that mouth of yours is always speaking before you think opinionated and stubborn as a mule you get that from your father
2401106 he never says anything because he is too afraid of hurting me and our relationship
2401107 i know i need to get over that i am trying it isnt easy i almost lost you when i expressed my feelings for you i dont like how that feels
2401108 you need to stop questioning me you know i dont tell you anything but the truth and i never go back on my word to you
2401109 but mom is right we need to figure this out are you up to a casting
2401110 just a little dizzy and out of sorts i know that was recent but it took more to do that than i thought there is still a lingering spell and the person who cast it knows i was tapping in however they left their signature so i know who she is now
2401111 i dont care i willl kill the bitch slash her tires cut her into pieces douse her with kerosene and light a match she has no fucking right to treat you this way
2401112 i knew shed been messing with my dreams and trying to shield her out is nigh on impossible

2401217 all fruit and veggies imported into the us must be irradiated
2401218 let me tell you about codex alimentarius let me define it for you let me help you understand the enemy and let me assure you that absolutely nothing that im going to tell you is exaggerated is interpolated or is imagined everything im going to tell you is documented and a great deal of it is documented on my web site
2401219 lets talk about milk we have recombinant bovine growth hormone and now we can choose milk with it or milk without it butter with it butter without it right not under codex because under codex every dairy cow on the planet must be treated with monsantos recombinant bovine growth hormone furthermore under codex every animal used for food on the planet whether it has fins feet or feathers every animal on the planet must be treated with sub clinical antibiotics must be treated with sub clinical antibiotics and must be treated with exogenous growth hormones codex requires mandates that all food be irradiated unless its eaten locally and raw all food including organic food of course
2401220 in a landmark decision by the international food standards agency codex an application to have a standard set for the residue limits of rbst was rejected following appeals by consumers international at a codex meeting in june 1997 the usa had requested an international standard for minimum residue limits for the hormone which would have effectively given it a trading licence by codex
2401221 concluded that bst residual levels in milk were very low and that bst naturally found in milk is nontoxic according to jecfa no mrl was necessary when rbst was administered properly
2401222 within codex food irradiation is classified as an additive thus food irradiation falls under the jurisdiction of the codex committee on food additives and contaminants ccfac ccfac depends on several sources of information in evaluating food additives in the case of irradiation ccfac draws from the joint fao who expert committees on food additives jecfa as well as the international atomic energy agency iaea and the international consultative group on food irradiation icgfi as shown in an october 2002 report by public citizen bad taste the disturbing truth about the world health organisations endorsement of food irradiation 2 the who has relied on a very small number of faulty studies in declaring food irradiation safe this unscientific and shoddy work is the foundation of acceptance of food irradiation across the world codex has become an instrument of the liberalization of international trade instead of a method to protect the food supplies of peoples across the world
2401223 codex weakened the international food irradiation rule to allow any food to be irradiated at any dose regardless of how high the new standard contains no maximum radiation dose to which foods can be treated the previous limit was 10 kilogray a dose of radiation equivalent to 330 million chest x rays at such doses the chemical composition of foods can be altered vitamins proteins and other nutrients can be destroyed and flavor odor and texture can be corrupted
2401224 since codex standards are enforceable through the world trade organization member nations that have food irradiation laws stricter than the new codex standard could have their laws challenged and overruled
2401225 if fda and codex has its way all food will be irradiated
2401226 the codex general standard for irradiated foods cac rs 106 1979 was adopted by the codex alimentarius commission at its 13th session in 1979 and was subsequently revised in 1983 by the 15th session this standard has been submitted to all member nations and associate members of fao and who for acceptance in accordance with the general principles of the codex alimentarius
2401227 because under codex every dairy cow on the planet must be treated with monsantos recombinant bovine growth hormone
2401228 codex requires mandates that all food be irradiated unless its eaten locally and raw all food including organic food of course

2401240 people who go see them like to imagine themselves as the person theyre watching that might seem vulgar and maybe the greatest acting transcends that but even in the greatest acting its there its a strange paradox that theyve got to be glamorous and appealing for the audience to identify with them but at the same time theyve got to be willing to turn themselves inside out in a way that most people would find excruciatingly embarrassing and uncool to experience or do in public

2401250 it is ra when at the beginning he rose in the city of
2401251 i am the great god who created himself even nu who made his names to become the company of the gods as gods
2401252 it is ra the creator of the names of his limbs which came into being in the form of the gods who are in the train of ra
2401253 i am he who cannot be repulsed among the gods
2401254 it is temu the dweller in his disk but others say that it is ra when he riseth in the eastern horizon of the sky
2401255 yesterday is osiris and to day is ra when he shall destroy the enemies of neb er tcher the lord to the uttermost limit and when he shall establish as prince and ruler his son horus
2401256 others however say that to day is ra on the day when we commemorate the festival of the meeting of the dead osiris with his father ra and when the battle of the gods was fought in which osiris the lord of amentet was the leader
2401257 it is amentet that is to say the creation ofthe souls of the gods when osiris was leader in set amentet
2401258 others however say that it is the amentet which ra hath given unto me when any god cometh he must rise up and fight for it
2401259 i am the benu bird which is in anu i am the keeper of the volume of the book the tablet of destiny of the things which have been made and of the things which shall be made
2401260 others however say that it is the dead body of osiris and yet others say that it is the excrement of osiris
2401261 i am the god menu in his coming forth may his two plumes be set on my head for me
2401262 menu is horis the advocate of his father osiris and his coming forth means his birth the two plumes on his head are
2401263 i have made an end of my shortcomings and i have put away my faults
2401264 it is the cutting of the navel string of the body of the osiris the scribe ani whose word is true before all the gods and all his faults are driven out
2401265 it is the purification of osiris on the day of his birth
2401266 i am purified in my great double nest which is in hensu on the day of the offerings of the followers of the great god who dwelleth therein
2401267 the name of one nest is millions of years and great green sea is the name of the other that is to say
2401268 others however say the name of the one is guide of millions of years and that lake is name of the other
2401269 i pass over the way i know the head of the
2401270 i osiris the scribe ani whose word is truth have filled for thee the utchat the eye of ra or of horus when it had suffered extinction on the day of the combat of the two fighters horus and set
2401271 i remove the thunder cloud from the sky when there is a storm with thunder and lightning therein
2401272 this storm was the raging of ra at the thunder cloud which set sent forth against the right eye of ra the sun
2401273 others however say that the thunder cloud is caused by sickness in the eye of ra which weepeth for its companion eye the moon at this time thoth cleanseth the right eye of ra
2401274 i behold ra who was born yesterday from the thighs of the goddess mehurt his strength is my strength and my strength is his strength
2401275 mehurt is the great celestial water but others say that mehurt is the image of the eye of ra at dawn at his birth daily
2401276 others howeve r say that mehurt is the utchat of ra
2401277 now osiris the scribe ani whose word is truth is a very great one among the gods who are in the following of horus they say that he is the prince who loveth his lord
2401278 homage to you o ye lords of right and truth ye sovereign princes tchatcha who stand round about osiris who do away utterly sins and offences and who are in the following of the goddess hetepsekhus grant ye that i may come unto you
2401279 the lords of right and truth are thoth and astes the lord of amentet
2401280 the tchatcha round about osiris are kesta hapi tuamutef and qebhsenuf and they are also round about the constellation of the thigh the great bear in the northern sky
2401281 those who do away utterly sins and offences and who are in the following of the goddess hetepsekhus are the god sebek and his associates who dwell in the water
2401282 others however say that it is the flame which accompanieth osiris to burn up the souls of his enemies
2401283 as concerning all the faults which are in osiris the registrar of the offerings which are made unto all the gods ani whose word is truth these are all the offences which he hath committed against the lords of eternity since he came forth from his mothers womb
2401284 as concerning the seven spirits who are kesta hapi tuamutef qebhsenuf maa atef kheribeqef and heru khenti en ariti these did anubis appoint to be protectors of the dead body of osiris
2401285 others however say that he set them round about the holy place of osiris

2401287 the chief of the tchatcha sovereign princes who is in naarutef is horus the advocate of his father
2401288 as concerning the day wherein anubis said to the seven spirits come ye hither the allusion here is to the words come ye hither which ra spake unto osiris
2401289 i am the divine soul which dwelleth in the divine twin gods

2401311 he to whom the urrt crown hath been given with gladness of heart as lord of hensu is osiris he was bidden to rule among the gods on the day of the union of earth with earth in the presence of nebertcher

2401483 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2401487 yesterday senator landrieu took a stand against taxpayers innovation and economic growth by blocking a vote on the permanent internet tax freedom act
2401488 with broad support for permanently banning internet taxes landrieus efforts to stand in the way of s 2128 are surprising especially after her constituents relied heavily on internet communication following hurricane katrina
2401489 resolution asks the public to interview at least one veteran in their family or community and encourages participation by local state and national organizations along with federal state city and parish or county governments
2401490 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2401491 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2401492 i will wait to see if a clean version of the rule is released for publication in the federal register and then i will believe it
2401493 the bush administration has consistently supported the unborn however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
2401494 any activity with a logical connection to a procedure health service or health service program or research activity this includes referral training and other arrangements of the procedure health service or research activity
2401495 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
2401496 until the regulation removes the re definition of abortion and it clearly states that it deals solely with abortion and not with any other procedure nor with any refusals based on the nature of the patient such as single or gay i would not be satisfied
2401497 there is no reason to extend any benefit of the doubt to this administration when it comes to reproductive rights or the civil rights of gay people
2401498 we remain concerned by the regulations potential to create barriers for women seeking health care to jeopardize federal programs that provide family planning services and to disrupt state laws securing womens access to birth control
2401499 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either

2401667 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say

2401699 last year 29 children died after being left in hot cars between 1998 and 2007 there have been 344 such deaths
2401700 close to 40 percent of all children who died in a hot car were forgotten
2401701 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
2401702 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
2401703 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
2401704 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

2401741 to me the most interesting contrast between the two is that doctor horrible when he had captain hammer completely at his mercy was paralyzed by indecision but captain hammer with doctor horrible at his mercy pulled the trigger with no remorse and no second thought the bad guy couldnt kill the good guy didnt hesitate

2401756 seriously peter why not just treasure the great memories youve had at the adventurers club without turning it into a big thing
2401757 considering i said it 3 days ago and now youre the one dragging it back up just to sling shit around maybe you should have
2401758 i am not an economist but i am shocked that you dont understand the only subject which is of interest to the administration of the walt disney company the management wants to maximize profits
2401759 pad would like the adventurers club to stay open but that means absolutely nothing to robert iger nor should it
2401760 he makes no argument at all that disney executives should do as he says
2401761 disney executives should be persuaded by the fact that i proposed to my wife at this place
2401762 someone needs to ask john mccain what hes for rather than just what hes against

2401785 come and see the violence inherent in the system help help im being repressed
2401786 democrats are polling 15 or 20 ahead of republicans but mccain is still able to keep up with obama
2401787 has anyone considered the possibility that mccain doesnt really want to win
2401788 cmon virtually every poll whether done by tv stations newspapers or private pollers seem to be showing a close race
2401789 why assume some conspiracy when it could just be you know a close race why have these perfidous pollsters not just made up a 20 point mccain lead if theyre so hell bent on lying
2401790 this is the formula for obama supporters to grab defeat from the jaws of victory assume the win is in the bag and any evidence to the contrary is just media spin
2401791 bloo bloo my daddy came back from the war and didnt pay attention to me now i have to give the country to reactionaries again because we cant have hillary bloo bloo bloo
2401792 then does media coverage of mccain consist only of what obama says about him or their reactions to obama
2401793 it sint obama who im saying is getting arrogant its his supporters
2401794 i notice that obama isnt talking about how the polls are fixed
2401795 if anyone has any actual evidence that the polls are intentionally fixed
2401796 declined to be released as a p o w a few times because a he didnt want to be used as propaganda for the enemy and b he wanted other soldiers released
2401797 was then too stupid to get away when he had the chance
2401798 obamas young just like brittney and paris do you really want a young person like brittney or paris running the country
2401799 sorry i realize this is my opinion and not a reaction to what you actually said
2401800 that is quite possibly the most moronic thing you have ever said
2401801 how much do you have to hate your partys nominee if you cant even say hes ready for the job
2401802 clinton and bush had all the same intelligence on iraq

2401804 how do i confidently steer our company through uncharted waters without the fear of shipwreck along the way
2401805 many people have done the hike up to whitney this winter there were very few days without signatures in the register new years must have had quite a party on the summit dozens of people signed the register
2401806 now abideth faith hope charity these 3 but the greatest of these is charity
2401807 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are now seen were not made of things which do appear

2401838 postcom was very pleased to hear that the postal service reconsidered their position on imb after receiving input from mtac mailers technical advisory committee members
2401839 this additional incentive for full service adoption would be available in fall 2009
2401840 i think that made it difficult for mailers to justify their roi in making the programming changes and process changes to implement imb
2401841 it was a great escape for all of us the flight crew did a fantastic job
2401842 for a second i thought it was a failure of the hydraulic system the flight was brought back and we were asked to disembark had the flight taken off it would have been a big tragedy the pilot acted with the presence of mind
2401843 claiming to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves because they exchanged the truth about god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen

2401846 sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences

2401856 japan has a mission and a responsibility to take initiative in eradicating nuclear weapons
2401857 their concept of the processes of law enforcements engagement with the media has changed dramatically from seven years ago
2401858 seven years ago when we started working with them they said not only would they arrest any protesters during the games but they would arrest the media
2401859 we tried very hard to convince them that wouldnt go over very well
2401860 our job is to help cities put on a major event not to suppress civilians and suppress democracy
2401861 the olympics has become a magnet for every protest group in the world
2401862 they want to capture international media attention because there are so many reporters here so you factor it into risk planning
2401863 other olympic host cities have tried to put their best face forward
2401864 they are a threat to national security but theres no evidence to indicate etim has any infrastructure in beijing
2401865 attempts to reach agreement on key ministerial posts have failed
2401866 attempts will now be made to form a government on the basis of majority in the assembly
2401867 we dont seen any meaning in leading the government if we have share home finance and defence ministries
2401868 its in everybodys best interests to try to have the commission respond to us so we can answer these questions and really put it behind us and continue to do the work of the ura and the citizens
2401869 the mayor is not going to get word from the commission
2401870 if he does they will be violating mr fords right to confidentiality
2401871 your failure thus far when you have granted such expediency in the past and possess said authority violates my clients rights
2401872 only the commission may act upon the closing of a preliminary inquiry to date the commission has not acted upon the matter involving your client
2401873 if a formal investigation had been launched pat wouldve been notified and he hasnt been notified
2401874 as a matter of law there cant be an investigation
2401875 leads me to believe that mr contino is operating on a political level which is disturbing
2401876 if in fact mr fishers statements are accurate and correct
2401877 lets let them conclude their investigation and once we do that well make our decisions here on the ura level
2401878 been informed that as the person who provided the initial referral i would be included on any correspondence relating to the closing of a matter
2401879 i dont think youll find a single city taxpayer who wants pat ford to continue to get paid to stay at home
2401880 hi dad just wanted to let you know that today i had the most delicious lunch ive taken to work all summer a big fat tomato and cucumber slices with some salt vinegar and olive oil i dont know how im going to go back to my store vegetable salads
2401881 everythings done quite well and im starting to reap all the benefits of main crops
2401882 its really terrific theres nothing to compare with fresh vegetables in the garden
2401883 we havent lost the battle with the morning glories but there have been some blooms theres been no reports of thieving
2401884 its gods way of saving me from having too many tomatoes
2401885 each one is a different color i got 12 of them for a dollar its been a real cheap thrill they can be ethereal in their beauty
2401886 ive never had any luck with cantaloupes and ive got four or five that look like theyre going to get to giant eagle size
2401887 i had the idea to rub a hot pepper on it its warm its soothing it feels like heaven
2401888 house histories a guide to tracing the genealogy of your home
2401889 the challenge became how to get a high quality real world product from students with little to no formal historic preservation background
2401890 i knew that the class had to be highly structured and thats when i got the idea to model it on the work that i do every day here at pfaffmann
2401891 it was neat to see what discoveries they would come up with every day
2401892 mr and mrs godfrey and their family live in the immense mansion built by mr smith the pipe manufacturer on winebiddle and penn avenues
2401893 decidedly domestic mrs godfrey rarely goes out except in response to calls of missionary or church work she is a baptist to which she is devoted their wealth would reach about the 300 000 figure misses jessie and hattie godfrey the daughters of the house are both bright young ladies the former a musician and the latter something of a beauty
2401894 gave us a great two hours on how to do quality research
2401895 that was the first week of class and he set the stage perfectly for what i wanted to do
2401896 we not only spent a lot of time looking at the history of the building and the people who lived there but also mortar analysis and how the building has physically changed and what is necessary to better preserve it
2401897 the experience of presenting to an audience and having media interviews was invaluable
2401898 that made it much more intense than any other class ive ever taken
2401899 he was very demanding and was very involved in it himself
2401900 he was part of our group and pushed us pretty hard
2401901 he was a catcher who crouched low to the ground with one leg out and moved around a lot
2401902 he chattered and was always talking he was mr hustle and his uniform was always dirty you had to know tim some people didnt care for that chatter and others thought it was for fun he was a jokester nothing bothered him
2401903 i remember in batting practice before a game he was a human pitching machine hed throw one strike after another and you better be ready to hit because he never stopped there was no loafing when tim was playing ball if you came late to a game he made sure you didnt want to be late again
2401904 he treated me like a son i worked with him day in and day out for 13 years and never once did he call himself the owner he was more like a co worker and a friend
2401905 a lot of people never saw his sense of humor but i did we used to laugh daily
2401906 our first priority has been to work with the state to see the site stabilized
2401907 with the filing were preserving our right to pursue any potential claims against the real estate and engineering professionals who provided assurances that the location was appropriate for our commercial development
2401908 obviously we are disappointed that we were led to invest millions in a project that we were forced to abandon
2401909 if someone was down he would bring him up i never saw him depressed
2401910 people didnt follow him because he outranked them or he yelled at them they followed him because they wanted to
2401911 it was one of the many times he showed his diligence he rehabbed the hardest of anybody ive ever seen and he got into west point
2401912 hes under a confidentiality agreement with me not to talk to the media about this case

2401928 make much of their profits by preying on and deceiving the vulnerable so it is not surprising that this industry should attract people of less than the highest ethical character
2401929 its always better to be conservative in matters like this and certainly with the credit markets as they are it allows us to fully explain and justify the deal
2401930 reserving the option to not move to 5 000 unless market forces warrant it
2401931 essentially gaming revenues are declining in almost every market in the united states currently given that backdrop its difficult to understand why projections for a new property would suddenly become greater today than they were at some point in the past
2401932 a casino in pittsburgh will do quite well but im not convinced that it will do that well

2401934 we had people on the drafting committee that had been clinton supporters that had been obama supporters by the end we were all in agreement on what should be in the platform
2401935 they did a nice job melding the clinton views and the obama views together not that they were that far apart

2401951 it is extremely dif ficult to grow a consumer cata log businesses today
2401952 were finding that more consumers are using internet search engines for shopping or are visiting name brand sites although the ward brand needs to be rebuilt it does have strong recognition among consumers
2401953 it used to be easy to craft a merchan dise concept define a niche put together a catalog and mail it out

2401955 enterprises are looking for leadership in the design and implementation of caller authentication solutions including voice biometrics for their call centers
2401956 the opportunity is real research has shown that consumers around the world feel that voice verification is a secure form of identity verification for phone access to customer service data nuances commitment to assembling the technologies products and services necessary to deliver that leadership to the marketplace is extremely compelling
2401957 all around us we are seeing young people today become interested again in the old hymns they are looking for something solid substantial lasting substantive and theyre finding them in the great texts that the church has been singing for two thousand years sadly however in our time all around us they have been so forgotten that weve forgotten the stories of their authors the composers and we havent even paid attention to their texts

2401964 early results of study using fair isaacs proven fraud detection technology indicate that 10 15 percent of advertisers billed traffic from ad networks may be fraudulent
2401965 these are early results based upon a limited view of the market

2401972 we had decided to take part in the all party meet and place our viewpoint before them but the very presence of three major kashmiri leaders central water resources minister saif ud din soz national conference patron farooq abdullah and peoples democratic party pdp president mehbooba mufti has made us rethink our decision and boycott the meet
2401973 soz mehbooba and farooq are responsible for the fire in which the state is engulfed they are the culprits how can we talk to them
2401974 ich glaube er wird es in den n chsten stunden unterschreiben

2401977 the simultaneous release of transcripts in english pashto and arabic indicate the group is looking at a wider audience including the english speaking world
2401978 one of the things though that i think the antiwar crowd has not considered is that if were putting the americans right within their terrorists arms reach they dont have to come to wall street to kill americans they dont have to knock down the trade center they can do it around the corner and convenience is a big factor when youre a terrorist
2401979 the 12 hottest years in history have all been in the last 13 years
2401980 its not a question of debate what about the medieval warming period the historical record shows they were growing wine in england for goodness sake come on it is not disputed by anyone that the vikings arrived in greenland in ad900 and it was warmer than greenland is now what penny wong is doing is being selective and saying that is a long time ago
2401981 land based temperature readings are corrupted by the urban heat island effect
2401982 urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro climate around the thermometer due to vegetation changes concrete cars and houses
2401983 that doesnt mean you give up on the science and that you cant draw valid conclusions about the nature of earths temperature change
2401984 create a brouhaha and muddy the waters in the climate change story
2401985 all official measures of global temperature show that it peaked in 1998 and has been declining since at least 2002
2401986 and this is in the face of an almost 5 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1998 spot the problem
2401987 the changes in temperature over the past 10 years have basically plateaued
2401988 but scientists did not anticipate a gradual year by year warming in temperature what matters is the long term trend this outcome does not change any of the science but it does change the spin climate deniers can put on it
2401989 in the last 10 years we have seen an increase in carbon dioxide levels yet temperatures are coming down that if anyone looks at the actual data is not disputable carbon dioxide is not driving temperatures because there are other important climatic factors at play
2401990 from a climate standpoint it is far too short a period to have any significance
2401991 what we are seeing now is consistent with our understanding of variability between decades if we hung about for another 30 years and it kept going down then you might start to think there is something we dont understand but the evidence at this point suggests this is not something we should hang around and wait for
2401992 in the last 10 years there has been a catastrophic and massive arctic sea ice retreat weve seen glacial retreat permafrost thaw and ocean thermal expansion so temperature is not the whole story
2401993 it is widely alleged that the science of global warming is settled
2401994 this implies that all the major scientific aspects of climate change are well understood and uncontroversial the allegation is profoundly untrue even the most widely held opinions should never be regarded as an ultimate truth
2401995 climate change is a robust area of science and there is plenty that is still being debated and new discoveries are still being made
2401996 it is a topic that will keep attracting different opinions from enthusiasts and from bloggers they are a minority but they are proving to be a very vocal group
2401997 gores vision of greater state control over the economy has already produced some of the greatest environmental disasters in history
2401998 this report makes an important contribution in helping to describe and explain the current state of high end climate modeling for the non specialist
2401999 no current model is superior to others in all respects but rather different models have differing strengths and weaknesses
2402000 this study is very important from the viewpoint of finding synergies between electrical energy and chemical energy stored in hydrogen
2402001 the study shows that currently hydrogen is not profitable solely for electricity storage on the other hand it might be economically acceptable to produce hydrogen from electricity at advantageous electricity hydrogen prices furthermore hydrogen is shown to be a highly favorable option when there are electricity transmission constraints in the area limiting sales of electricity of a power producer
2402002 hydrogen production might become profitable when the hydrogen economy becomes fully mature i e when the demand and correspondingly prices for hydrogen increases expected mainly from the transportation sector
2402003 this might happen when the prices of fossil fuels rise as a result of many different possible factors e
2402004 in this context it is also important that research into hydrogen production storage transmission distribution and consumption components wins the battle with the electron economy where the energy carrier is considered to be electricity those two economies compete in many different areas such as efficiencies durability and prices currently hydrogen is advantageous in terms of higher energy density and durability but still lags in efficiencies
2402005 hydrogen storage for mixed wind nuclear power plants in the context of a hydrogen economy
2402006 there had been no warming in europe during the past 65 years europe warmed only 58 degrees celsius during the past 250 years with all of the warming taking place between 1890 and the mid 1930s and at the same time as an increase in the output of the sun
2402007 the average temperature of the earth has varied within a range of about 3 degrees celsius during the past 3 000 years
2402008 while the average temperature change taking place as the earth recovers from the little ice age is so slight that it is difficult to discern its environmental effects are measurable
2402009 greenland for example is beginning to turn green again as it was 1 000 years ago during the medieval climate optimum arctic sea ice is decreasing somewhat but antarctic ice is not decreasing and may be increasing due to increased snow
2402010 all of the observed climate changes are gradual moderate and entirely within the bounds of ordinary natural changes that have occurred during the benign period of the past few thousand years
2402011 there is no indication whatever in the experimental data that an abrupt or remarkable change in any of the ordinary natural climate variables is beginning or will begin to take place
2402012 in my more than 60 years as a member of the american scientific community including service as president of both the national academy of sciences and the american physical society i have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer review process than the events that led to this ipcc report
2402013 a comparison between the report approved by the contributing scientists and the published version reveals that key changes were made after the scientists had met and accepted what they thought was the final peer reviewed version
2402014 if they lead to carbon taxes and restraints on economic growth they will have a major and almost certainly destructive impact on the economies of the world whatever the intent was of those who made these significant changes their effect is to deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming
2402015 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
2402016 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that
2402017 im sorry i havent said anything before but i didnt want to worry you it looks like i might be arrested at climate camp it is my choice and its something i feel strongly about please dont be angry
2402018 we are also doing this because we feel our bail conditions are disproportionate to our supposed offences i can see the logic in keeping us away from power stations but to keep us away from this event where people are meeting to discuss how to tackle climate change is wrong
2402019 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
2402020 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2402021 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
2402022 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
2402023 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
2402024 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
2402025 this attack on american soil must not stand the people of georgia must be defended

2402043 due to the serious allegations that have been raised regarding cuppys failure to honor various contractual commitments and your apparent decision to cease our communications i have determined to suspend your accredited status with the aafd pending consideration and action of the aafd board of directors
2402044 our purpose remains to inspire fair contracts and collaborative relationships and we are open to negotiating and mediating effective relief for all cuppys franchisees in a manner that will effect restitution from injuries and will allow cuppys coffee to achieve the corporate goals set by new management upon its acquisition of the company
2402045 the path to a successful resolution of the cuppys quagmire is through communication negotiation collaboration and if necessary mediation the path to certain destruction is to ignore the problem and face an inevitable and costly litigative path

2402048 already spineless gun control advocates are squawking like chickens with their tiny brained heads chopped off making political hay over this most recent devastating virginia tech massacre when in fact it is their own forced gun free zone policy that enabled the unchallenged methodical murder of 32 people
2402049 ich bin wirklich froh dass ich hier herkommen konnte und all das erleben darf

2402052 we didnt think there would be anything other than the normal questions but there was
2402053 they went through our entire truck they did not go through our toiletries which we were surprised about but they opened up the laptop and i guess one of the icons said porn on it
2402054 he came back and said were going to have to confiscate the laptop
2402055 mostly we want to let people know they shouldnt have any pornographic material period
2402056 how is that going to protect us or keep us safe what a waste of manpower what a waste of the security state shouldnt they be looking for knives and guns wouldnt that be a better use of their time
2402057 you dont want your name flagged when you cross the border it is a major inconvenience its not just that youd lose your laptop its that you cant fly into or connect in any american airports without a lot of hassle and so people ask themselves if its worth it
2402058 they have no legal right to keep either of those
2402059 there is nothing wrong with watersports its not an obscene activity its something that lots of gay couples participate in and fisting our court case 10 years ago proved that fisting is not an obscene activity

2402063 the birth certificate establishes the existence of the child weve all seen the child so theres no doubt about it so what is the problem in issuing her birth certificate
2402064 without the birth certificate we cant apply for a travel document that would enable her to get a visa and leave the country and be with her family which is the final aim of what we are working for
2402065 we couldnt have allowed the two babies to be fed by the same woman as that might have passed on manjhis infection to the other child the foster mother is trying to help but that could have put her own child in danger that is why we have asked the lady not to breastfeed manjhi any longer

2402072 the 29th olympic games show the chinese peoples talent greatness and the organization capabilities which amaze the world one more time
2402073 we have seen one of the most majestic ceremonies in the world china has set a great example of how to organize an inauguration ceremony where it combined the technology and the human elements it was a show that amazed and excited the whole world
2402074 the ceremony was very beautiful it was a good teaching of the ancient chinese culture and a proof of the greatness of chinese people in all senses
2402075 i have attended 10 olympic games inaugurations and have never seen an opening with such a display of technology before it was impressive i sincerely congratulate the chinese people who have always been highly respected by mexicans

2402091 although the congress has been doing a relatively good job in its role as a rubber substitute unlike me it has very little experience in creating and administering a war torn nation
2402092 also the us congress has traditionally been weak against fighting here in the us how can one expect it to fight against terrorists in iraq
2402093 the fact that an arab nation which used to be a dictatorship is now ruled by the democratically elected leader of another country just goes to show that democracy is on the march in the middle east
2402094 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day
2402095 teach him how to fish and he will eat for a lifetime however if you keep him away from fish altogether he will stick to eating vegetables
2402096 assuming of course that you also lock him inside his own house and prevent him from eating fish in a restaurant
2402097 just like condoms would protect our children from exposure to aids so should we be protecting our children from exposure to condoms only then would our precious culture be protected from exposure to sex
2402098 are neighborhoods in baghdad where you and i could walk through those neighborhoods today
2402099 all i wanted to do was to take a long solitary walk among those trees and burnt out car shells and i cant even do that without a blackhawk helicopter or an apache gunship shadowing me from above
2402100 you are not the boss of me us army sharpshooter on that terrace over there so just leave me alone
2402101 i cannot imagine what these people think they are protecting me from bullets shrapnel fragments this is iraq not washington dc you know
2402102 what if i were to suddenly decide to pick flowers from a grassy meadow or jump into a pond with those iraqi kids and splash around in a carefree manner to celebrate the safeness of this very safe neighborhood
2402103 how would i be able to do that with this heavy vest restricting my every degree of freedom
2402104 look how peaceful it is not a single suicide bomber or ied in sight dont you wish downtown manhattan were as serene and uncrowded
2402105 our assignment is to make sure we send him back to the us in one piece but it is turning into a highly difficult task its like he wants to get killed he keeps asking to be let inside suspiciously abandoned vehicles or allowed to open unidentified packages left by the roadside just to prove how safe iraqi streets really are
2402106 it is common knowledge that the lab of god high up in the heavens is said to be a thousand miles in length a thousand miles in width and a million angel lengths in height
2402107 therefore to round up and fit ten thousand human generations inside this massive complex would not be an issue for him at all which by the way is made of pure gold and encrusted with millions of sparkling diamonds
2402108 its a well known and scientifically verifiable fact that god is all knowing all seeing and all understanding
2402109 who could possibly do a better job of working with and examining intricate and minuscule pieces of his own work such as dna strands
2402110 has his own television and radio satellite channels more than 300 television and radio programs an entourage of 300 faithful pastors and millions of followers
2402111 we have enough supplies to meet demand for years to come
2402112 assuming of course that we will continue to be at war for the next few years please god let there be war for the next few years
2402113 in order for us to win in iraq we need americans to support our troops by buying these ribbons that show their support towards the ribbons that support our troops
2402114 these ribbons are courageous warriors fighting on the forefront of our battle for public opinion
2402115 and right now with public opinion being massively against the war the importance of supporting them iraqi republican guard despatched to assist in hurricane rescue efforts 45 of america lose trust in bush rest out having tea with the tooth fairy us preparing groundwork for future invasion of saudi arabia by selling it weapons

2402129 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2402130 skin is lighter than the way im used to seeing her
2402131 advertisers and magazines need to be careful about this even if its just a production process
2402132 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2402133 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2402134 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2402135 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2402136 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2402137 this is the toughest course i have ever seen at a tournament event
2402138 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports but labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
2402139 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
2402140 during the middle of a campaign youre always worried about taking some time off
2402141 i think there are a lot of democrats who are nervous
2402142 i think they thought this election would fall into their laps
2402143 an artificial expectation that he needs to be way ahead at this time
2402144 history is replete with northern liberals who end up losing
2402145 anybody gone into whole foods lately and see what they charge for arugula rocket
2402146 not long ago a couple of hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2402147 i predict that will be translate into a vote for obama
2402148 it is aimed at giving women a zest for life and some fun or general interest in life after 50
2402149 thats what it has become we wear purple and red hats and its fun
2402150 i enjoy the camaraderie and the opportunity to do things i wouldnt otherwise do
2402151 its ridiculous i must be a heck of a writer to produce a pornographic book without sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet muhammads harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex
2402152 it was my hope that my book would develop empathy for this other culture
2402153 it has always rankled me the way history focuses on men and wars and mens politics and leaves women out i wanted to honour the women in muhammads life by giving them a voice
2402154 it is not just that there were issues with historical accuracy this was quite deliberately provocative she objectified the wife of the prophet as a sex object and made her violent as well
2402155 married at nine to the much older muhammad aisha uses her wits her courage and her sword to defend her first wife status even as muhammad marries again and again taking 12 wives and concubines in all
2402156 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
2402157 denise says it is a declaration of war a national security issue
2402158 think it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses sic and the danish cartoons
2402159 it could incide acts of violence by a small radical segment
2402160 its going to be a real test for him mugabe
2402161 he knows theres a lot at stake here including for him personally
2402162 we will have to see how his role is defined in government before we decide whether to accept it or not
2402163 mugabe will be there but the person in charge will be morgan tsvangirai
2402164 at least the killing has stopped in the past week
2402165 they may be pretending to lead peaceful protests but they actually foment trouble
2402166 winners have simply formed the habit of doing things losers dont like to do
2402167 pobre botafogo jogou melhor n o teve sorte e n o foi campe o
2402168 so whenever i find myself unhappy with the way my life has turned up or the people that are in my life i simply remember all that is subject to change the universe has been comprised of delicate fabrics that ironically sustain the ultimate supernova and continue surviving so the problems of my day and of my life i suppose they can go off and bother somebody else they say that when dreams die the body soon follows but i guess here is where i find solace the land that transcends between this reality and the subconscious next one
2402169 therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself
2402170 it seemed in the late 1950s that americans were hopelessly wed to time saving nutritionally suspect food whose chief virtue was its ability to provide instant gratification of the most untutored senses then along came in close succession an imperious french chef a couple of gay men and a remarkably tall surprisingly telegenic woman

2402175 gore receives 18 of the vote when included in the list of possible democratic candidates however clinton maintains a sizable lead and gore runs neck and neck with obama for second place
2402176 mrs clinton the most important vote of your political career and you got it wrong
2402177 as is the case nationally clinton gains from being seen as the strongest leader and the most electable contender among current candidates but in a state where retail politics can be crucial she lags far behind her main rivals in voters rankings of the most likable candidate

2402197 it is a huge disappointment because this vaccine has shown promise all the way through but its only when you get in on these big trials that you start to see how the vaccine behaves
2402198 although in earlier studies we saw beautiful immune responses it doesnt look like this immune response translates into something that could protect people against hiv infection

2402235 we maintain neutrality in providing medical treatment in the camps for the displaced people in dantewada district located in south chhattisgarh medical teams also provide mobile health services and nutritional support to those in need in remote rural areas surprisingly the situation in chhattisgarh is only one of several armed conflicts occurring throughout india for years with civilians caught between various belligerent parties as a consequence many people continue to live in an atmosphere of fear and violence with little or no access to health care

2402304 the main points of the parable and hence of any sermon on it remain unchanged from matthew to mark to luke though detailed nuancing varies a little
2402305 you then listen to the parable of the sower 19 when anyone hears the word about the kingdom and doesnt understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart this is the one sown along the path
2402306 this is the meaning of the parable the seed is the word of god 12 the seeds along the path are those who have heard then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved matthew 13 20 and the one sown on rocky ground this is one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy 21 yet he has no root in himself but is short lived when pressure or persecution comes because of the word immediately he stumbles luke 8 13 and the seeds on the rock are those who when they hear welcome the word with joy having no root these believe for a littel while and depart in a time of testing matthew 13 22 now the one sown among the thorns this is one who hears the word but the worries of this age and the seduction of wealth choke the word and it becomes unfruitful luke 8 14 as for the seed that fell among thorns these are the ones who when they have heard go on their way and are choked with worries riches and pleasures of life and produce no mature fruit matthew 13 23 but the one sown on the good ground this is one who hears and understands the word who does bear fruit and yields some 100 some 60 some 30 times what was sown

2402393 the blog thing yeah thats definitely a little weird hows it going lately
2402394 first of all its not a fuckin blog i hate that word i dont blog im not writing an online journal im more interested in telling a good story than in telling the truth i just make shit up whenever its convenient which is most of the time so its definitely not a goddamn blog
2402395 i dont know what the fuck its called but its no blog
2402396 you mean like all that sappy shit about your feelings for jenny
2402397 exactly its a character i exaggerate reality to magnify the characters insecurities and neurotic headspeak i play up the dichotomy between the drinking and the childlike simplicity of his emotions its fictionnn ish
2402398 yeah but youre exactly like that what part are you exaggerating
2402399 all of it asshole its all an exaggeration its literaturrrre ish
2402400 uh i dont think so my friend its pretty much you
2402401 yeah some fuckin psycho wrote some nasty shit on the website last night he calls himself the crowbar mangler its been creeping me out all day
2402402 he called me a fuckin faggot and told me to cut off my hands and drink gasoline
2402403 how are you supposed to drink gasoline if you cut off your hands
2402404 i dont know through a straw or maybe im supposed to drink the gasoline first
2402405 oh i know who it was it was some stoner dude right here in ob tommy chong didnt realize that his ip address would display with his comment its no big deal i let it go
2402406 the thing is sev whenever i hear someone yell fuckin faggot at another person it reminds me of eddie berger
2402407 you know i grew up in the hood back east eddie berger was one of my classmates in sixth grade he was dumb as a stump and nearly two years older than the rest of us hed been held back twice he was a skinny little dude with mop top hair all hunched over and mostly deaf in one ear he talked like he had a mouth full of marbles but he was as harmless as a fly
2402408 why does hearing fuckin faggot remind you of him did he get caught blowing a guy in the park or something
2402409 no nothing like that one day in the summertime he was walking home from the store with a loaf of bread and a gallon of milk for his mom i was standing on the corner with my buddies and decided to have some fun it started out harmless enough i was making fun of the way he talked ehhhdeeee you weeetard stupid kid shit but then i ran across the street and backed him up against the wall of the rec building what are you looking at berger you fuckin faggot the poor kid was scared to death i still remember the look in his eyes but my friends were laughing and i was all puffed up with pre adolescent adrenaline kids can be so stupid at that age whack i smacked him in the side of the head the gallon of milk dropped and splattered on the ground this twelve year old kids eyes welled up with tears he put his hand over his ear and started bawling my ear my bad ear the milk my mom is gonna kill me my friends just laughed harder which only fueled this weird hateful impulse in me shut up you fuckin faggot whack i slapped him again but this time he stopped crying he just looked at me in silence with these sad hopeless eyes as if to say i give up it was like a brick hit me in the face all of a sudden i felt sick and couldnt breathe i was overcome with regret shit im sorry eddie i almost started crying myself im sorry man then eddie ran home and i probably ran home even faster calling someone a fuckin faggot has nothing to do with sexual preference its just the sound of hate i cant stand to hear it
2402410 whoa that doesnt sound like you sickboy you really smacked the kid
2402411 yeah i smacked him twice i was a kid but i learned my lesson what kills me is seeing these idiots these grown men who are like me when i was 11 years old they havent learned a damn thing they still carry around this latent ghetto rage that explodes with the words fuckin faggot every time someone different comes along its just ignorance hate its like the word nigger go out on to newport and scream fuckin nigger to the first person that walks by you cant do it right you cant yell those words because you need to have a belly full of hate just to get the words out you dont have it sevrin no reasonable person has that kind of hate festering inside theres no place for that shit in ob have you ever in real life seen someone yell fuckin nigger into the face of another human being
2402412 honestly growing up here i cant say that i ever saw it
2402413 well i have again the east coast hood rat that i am in my neighborhood there was a gang of high school kids who called themselves the bomb squad out of twenty of them there may have been three legitimately tough dudes it didnt matter because they never fought fair i once saw six of them beat on a black kid with brass knuckles and a baseball bat i think the kid was just passing through walking home from his job downtown or something he probably spent his busfare on a coke and a candy bar i was about twelve at the time stay the fuck out of our neighborhood you fuckin nigger the use of the word is the embodiment of pure hate im telling you sevrin that shit sticks with you i got no room for hate these days i just dont understand it
2402414 sickboy holy shit is the sermon on the mount over yet when did you get all preachy and shit lighten up
2402415 dont worry chloe sickboy is just pissed off because the mangler questioned his manhood
2402416 im not sure chloe maybe on your break you can give me twenty minutes in the back room and well figure it out together
2402417 harbor freight tools had sought to limit public disclosure of the fuse recall by marking its four page letter to nhtsa as a confidential communication the auto parts company asked the safety regulators to limit disclosure of the defect report from disclosure under the freedom of information act if successful this tactic would have prevented consumers from knowing they had potentially hazardous fuses in their cars

2402459 and when we arrived to deliver the devastating news to andy alexs father who lives in lawrence the tribune was already in the house snapping pictures as the family was told breaking down in tears it was total exploitation of this family who had been through so much we were horrified by the picture they ran on the front page the next day it was such an invasion of privacy
2402460 first what happened to andy alexs father was not right they came to the house and took a picture during private time for the family i wasnt there so you should talk to him
2402461 but i know he was very sad about that and it should not have happened

2402582 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2402583 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armored vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2402584 as world unites for games war breaks out in the caucus region
2402585 its definitely something that you can be conscious of and say is this person aware of me and attracted to me for me or is there something with my job
2402586 this is why people date within their peer group within the entertainment industry because people have an understanding of the schedule and what its like to be around people that have a job in the spotlight so they are less attracted to the job but you also have to get used to the fact that other people care who i am seeing or what i am doing that is interesting
2402587 i look at people like drew barrymore or cameron diaz the people i care about when i pick up people magazine
2402588 they navigate it very well you protect those things that are sacred and personal to you and i am a private person but i also recognize that people care differently now than they did its part of it you have to be able to take the whole reality
2402589 shes got a little bit of hair it has a bit of a reddish tinge

2402593 your family cares for you and my family cares for me
2402594 he is smarter than me and mature enough to deal with his business but because he is five years younger than me sometime his attitude looks cute in my eyes
2402595 she doesnt care what i do and i dont care what shes doing over there either
2402596 my ex wife lives with her boyfriend and our daughter now women are luckier we got divorced and she gets to enjoy a family while i send her money she earns as much as i do but i have to pay for her family
2402597 i could really enjoy my life more if i didnt have to support her
2402598 because her mother is japanese and so is her mothers boyfriend
2402599 the boyfriend is divorced from a german woman i know him well im sure he can be a good father figure for my daughter
2402600 and the month i got married but thats over with now
2402601 a lot of people didnt understand my passion for japan and criticized me for leaving my daughter and her mother in germany like i was wrong for moving to japan
2402602 but when a man is unfaithful there are already problems in the marriage
2402603 do you think you could fail in a marriage again in the future
2402604 no i dont think so i learned from the failure of my last marriage so i will be successful the next time
2402605 family has brought me nothing but troubles both my mother and my sister are mentally ill
2402606 i worked during the day but i still had four hours free and i couldnt spend them alone
2402607 im a man so i need a woman near me all the girlfriends ive ever had have been strong
2402608 but now that i have a good job i can lead the relationship
2402609 when i break up with a girlfriend i have to be cruel
2402610 i like buddha because he always has a smile on his face he looks happy jesus always looks unhappy
2402611 i traveled in the kingdom of bhutan where buddhism is such an important part of life i would like to teach there as a volunteer one day
2402612 what kind of man do you like do you prefer a gentleman or a beast
2402613 if im not attracted to someone i like him to behave as a gentleman all the time but if i like a man and he is always kind and sweet i get bored
2402614 i will lose my job soon because my contract will expire
2402615 in the end women get married to men and men work to support their wives so women neednt worry much about their careers
2402616 but men support women eventually and women depend on men because women are delicate and weak
2402617 some women are stronger than men some men are more sensitive than women
2402618 he is sharp and can cut a conversation like that
2402619 how do you feel about him what do you like about him
2402620 so he was stupid before and learned by making many mistakes
2402621 because i do not eat meat so i have to get nutrition this way
2402622 last night she got very angry and i couldnt sleep so please dont go home
2402623 i have a daughter in germany i cant have another family in thailand
2402624 pichaya doesnt have money to travel to japan so if i dont pay for her to come she cant come
2402625 but i cant get enough work done if i go abroad every vacation i cant bring all the documents i need to write my reports if i can stay in japan i can get a lot more work done
2402626 a great opportunity comes only once it never comes again if you dont take advantage of it when its offered to you
2402627 according to research the majority of successful people are ambitious and the rest are na ve
2402628 im going to postpone my trip to england for now
2402629 we cant decide what we will be especially when two people are attracted to each other
2402630 wasnt pichaya angry when you disappeared in the middle of the night
2402631 so he recommended that i visit sometime if i go i can meet him there during my trip
2402632 in germany people think a man with a thai girlfriend cant get a german girlfriend
2402633 its okay if pichaya and i live in a place where we are both foreigners but if we were to live in one of our own countries it would be more difficult
2402634 well what kind of relationship do you prefer do you want to be with a strong man or a weak one
2402635 i prefer an equal partnership a strong man is okay but if he tried to dominate me he would have a fight on his hands
2402636 once two people become intimate its easy for them to do so again in the future
2402637 only once she may know about it but i think she would understand my situation but dont tell her about this i was crazy about her in the past if a man really loves a woman he doesnt need another
2402638 if i asked you to be my girlfriend what would you say
2402639 if i asked if i could kiss you what would you do
2402640 youve had a bitter experience with a man so you want to keep yourself detached from them right
2402641 have you ever known a woman who became unhappy after getting intimate with you
2402642 i have good self control so i wont sleep with you and i wont love someone easily
2402643 my heart is lonely but this movie makes it feel warm
2402644 ive seen the movie too i was loneliest just after i finished my ph d at tokyo university but it was also the beginning of my success
2402645 my ten year old daughter will go to england alone on the plane because my ex wife doesnt want to see me although seeing her is okay with me
2402646 i dont need to thank you for giving me freedom
2402647 everybody either likes or hates me one of the two
2402648 i couldnt talk to my ex wife you should talk to her from now on
2402649 dont worry i normally stay in my relationships for a long time
2402650 you can answer because in asia men sometimes have many women
2402651 the man in the movie affirmed his love to the woman nicely
2402652 im terrible with that sort of thing i dont declare my love skillfully
2402653 i spent a very short time with my daughter i separated from my first wife when my daughter was very young so i am hardly aware that i am a father ive lived like a single man throughout my life
2402654 second wife third wife and many children across many countries
2402655 my daughter lives in this city shes becoming more german while i become more japanese
2402656 i have to look after her i have to take care of all her needs
2402657 listen ill go to my office and shut down my computer if you go home you can bring my apartment key
2402658 no im not a playboy i have deep affection for you
2402659 remember the day i went to your apartment in the middle of the night
2402660 at the time wed already had some difficulties so i went to your place
2402661 the more nights i spend with you the more i want to i want to spend every night with you but i cant hope for it anymore
2402662 i thought of you a lot last night so i called you this morning youre the one im thinking of
2402663 i want to keep in touch with her from now on
2402664 last year i proposed to a japanese girl the relationship between us was as understanding as the relationship between you and i
2402665 we did normally but one day she suggested that we separate and i ran after her at the time i got emotional and no longer cared about my life
2402666 my life will finish and ill have accomplished nothing more than teaching at a university
2402667 i wont go back to germany ill stay in japan forever i wont get married to her
2402668 that made it difficult to prove and to print the rumors that john edwards had cheated on his seriously ill wife while running for president reporters were left to poke around the edges of a potentially career ending scandal in search of an opening
2402669 the oil companies have placed their bets on john mccain

2402674 dan kami jadikan untuk masing masing kalian syariat dan minhaj
2402675 ikutilah apa yang diturunkan kepada kalian dari rabb kalian dan jangan kalian mengikuti para pimpinan selain nya sedikit sekali kalian mengambil pelajaran darinya
2402676 ketahuilah bahwasanya aku diberi al quran dan yang serupa dengannya bersamanya
2402677 sebaik baik manusia adalah generasiku kemudian yang setelah mereka kemudian yang setelah mereka
2402678 nabi mengabarkan bahwa sebaik baik generasi adalah generasinya secara mutlak itu berarti bahwa merekalah yang paling utama dalam segala pintu pintu kebaikan kalau tidak demikian yakni mereka baik dalam sebagian sisi saja maka mereka bukan sebaik baik generasi secara mutlak
2402679 mereka para shahabat di atas kita dalam segala ilmu ijtihad wara sikap hati hati akal dan pada perkara yang mendatangkan ilmu atau diambil darinya ilmu pendapat mereka lebih terpuji dan lebih utama buat kita dari pendapat kita sendiri wallahu alam demikian kami katakan jika mereka bersepakat kami mengambil kesepakatan mereka jika seorang dari mereka memiliki sebuah pendapat yang tidak diselisihi yang lain maka kita mengambil pendapatnya dan jika mereka berbeda pendapat maka kami mengambil sebagian pendapat mereka kami tidak akan keluar dari pendapat mereka secara keseluruhan
2402680 ilmu itu empat macam pertama apa yang terdapat dalam kitab allah atau yang serupa dengannya kedua apa yang terdapat dalam sunnah rasulullah atau yang semacamnya ketiga apa yang disepakati oleh para shahabat nabi atau yang serupa dengannya dan jika mereka berselisih padanya kita tidak boleh keluar dari perselisihan mereka keempat apa yang diangap baik oleh para ahli fikih atau yang serupa dengannya ilmu itu tidak keluar dari empat macam ini
2402681 setiap pendapat yang dikatakan hanya oleh seseorang yang hidup di masa ini dan tidak pernah dikatakan oleh seorangpun yang terdahulu maka itu salah
2402682 jangan sampai engkau mengeluarkan sebuah pendapat dalam sebuah masalah yang engkau tidak punya pendahulu padanya
2402683 ikutilah apa yang diturunkan kepadamu dari tuhanmu dan janganlah kamu mengikuti pemimpin pemimpin selain nya amat sedikitlah kamu mengambil pelajaran darinya
2402684 dan apa yang diberikan rasul kepadamu maka terimalah dan apa yang dilarangnya bagimu maka tinggalkanlah bertakwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah sangat keras hukuman nya
2402685 kaum muslimin bersepakat bahwa siapapun yang telah jelas baginya sunnah nabi maka dia tidak boleh berpaling darinya kepada ucapan seseorang siapapun dia
2402686 sesungguhnya tidak seorangpun dari ahlussunnah mengatakan bahwa kesepakatan empat imam itu adalah hujjah yang tidak mungkin salah dan tidak seorangpun dari mereka mengatakan bahwa kebenaran itu terbatas padanya dan bahwa yang keluar darinya berarti batil bahkan jika seorang yang bukan dari pengikut imam imam itu seperti sufyan ats tsauri al auzai al laits bin saad dan yang sebelum mereka atau ahlul ijtihadyang setelah mereka mengatakan sebuah pendapat yang menyelisihi pendapat imam imam itu maka perselisihan mereka dikembalikan kepada dan rasul nya dan pendapat yang paling kuat adalah yang berada di atasiallah dalil
2402687 setiap hadits yang menyelisihi madzhab kami maka itu mansukh terhapus hukumnya atau harus ditakwilkan yakni diarahkan kepada makna yang lain
2402688 adapun yang dalam hatinya terdapat penyelewengan dari kebenaran maka mereka mengikuti apa yang belum jelas dari ayat ayat itu mereka inginkan dengannya fitnah dan ingin mentakwilkannya padahal tidak ada yang mengetahui takwilnya kecuali allah
2402689 menginginkan fitnah artinya ingin menyesatkan para pengikutnya dengan mengesankan bahwa mereka berhujjah dengan al quran untuk membela bidah mereka padahal al quran itu sendiri menyelisihinya ingin mentakwilkannya artinya menyelewengkan maknanya sesuai dengan apa yang mereka inginkan
2402690 sesungguhnya ilmu ini adalah agama maka lihatlah dari siapa kalian mengambil agama kalian
2402691 dahulu orang orang tidak bertanya tentang sanad rangkaian para rawi yang meriwayatkan hadits maka tatkala terjadi fitnah mereka mengatakan sebutkan kepada kami sanad kalian sehingga mereka melihat kepada ahlussunnah lalu mereka menerima haditsnya dan melihat kepada ahlul bidah lalu menolak haditsnya
2402692 manusia tetap akan baik selama mereka mengambil ilmu dari orang orang besar mereka jika mereka mengambilnya dari orang orang kecil dan jahat di antara mereka maka mereka akan binasa
2402693 bahwa yang dimaksud dengan orang orang kecil dalam hadits umar dan hadits hadits yang semakna dengannya adalah orang yang dimintai fatwa padahal tidak punya ilmu dan orang yang besar artinya yang berilmu tentang segala hal atau yang mengambil ilmu dari para shahabat
2402694 katakanlah ya muhammad sesungguhnya aku memberi peringataan kepada kalian dengan wahyu
2402695 dan tidaklah yang diucapkan itu al quran menurut kemauan hawa nafsunya ucapannya itu tiada lain hanyalah wahyu yang diwahyukan kepadanya
2402696 seandainya agama ini dengan akal maka tentunya bagian bawah khuf semacam kaos kaki yang terbuat dari kulit lebih utama untuk diusap pada saat berwudhu red daripada bagian atasnya dan sungguh aku melihat rasulullah mengusap bagian atas khuf nya
2402697 adapun para pengikut kebenaran mereka menjadikan kitab dan sunnah sebagai panutan mereka mencari agama dari keduanya adapun apa yang terbetik dalam akal dan benak mereka hadapkan kepada kitab dan sunnah kalau mereka dapati sesuai dengan keduanya mereka terima dan bersyukur kepada allah yang telah memperlihatkan hal itu dan memberi mereka taufik tapi kalau mereka dapati tidak sesuai dengan keduanya mereka meninggalkannya dan mengambil kitab dan sunnah lalu menuduh salah terhadap akal mereka karena sesungguhnya keduanya tidak akan menunjukkan kecuali kepada yang haq kebenaran sedangkan pendapat manusia kadang benar kadang salah
2402698 tidaklah sebuah kaum sesat setelah mereka berada di atas petunjuk kecuali mereka akan diberi sifat jadal berdebat lalu beliau membaca ayat artinya bahkan mereka adalah kaum yang suka berbantah bantahan
2402699 di antara sesuatu yang diingkari para imam salafus shalih adalah perdebatan berbantah bantahan dalam masalah halal dan haram itu bukan jalannya para imam agama ini
2402700 ajaklah kepada jalan rabb mu dengan hikmah mauidhah nasihat yang baik dan berdebatlah dengan yang paling baik
2402701 okay guys i have an article here for you all to read remember how last week we discussed the neccesary conditions for life to exist on earth
2402702 well this article has to do with the possibility of life on another planet an exoplanet can anyone tell me what an exoplanet is
2402703 it is a planet outside of our solar system why do you all personally want to know if there is life on other planets ill write them up on the board
2402704 okay so lets read the first part of the article and then discuss it
2402705 work of mouth marketing is 10 times more effective than traditional marketing and it is free
2402706 ingatlah sesungguhnya wali wali alloh itu tidak ada kekhawatiran terhadap mereka dan tidak pula mereka bersedih hati yaitu orang orang beriman dan selalu bertaqwa
2402707 wali alloh hanyalah orang yang beriman kepada rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam beriman dengan apa yang dibawanya dan mengikuti secara lahir dan batin
2402708 katakanlah jika kamu benar benar mencintai alloh ikutilah aku niscaya alloh mengasihi dan mengampuni dosa dosamu
2402709 suatu kaum mengklaim mencintai alloh lantas alloh turunkan ayat ini sebagai ujian bagi mereka
2402710 fue responsabilidad de un exceso del uso cr tico de mi raz n creo que en ese momento perd la fe cuando la recuper ya hab a tomado la decisi n y hab a dejado la congregaci n dos a os antes
2402711 wow diana i cant believe no body speaks english here
2402712 is this a genuinely nice person or are they trying to rip me off as you always hear those stories
2402713 allah tidak di atas tidak juga di bawah tidak di sebelah kanan tidak pula di sebelah kiri tidak di barat tidak di timur tidak di selatan tidak juga di utara
2402714 allah menganugrahkan al hikmah kepahaman yang dalam tentang al qur an dan as sunnah kepada siapa yang dikehendakinya dan barangsiapa yang dianugrahi al hikmah itu ia benar benar telah dianugrahi karunia yang banyak dan hanya orang orang yang berakallah yang dapat mengambil pelajaran
2402715 katakanlah adakah sama orang orang yang mengetahui dengan orang orang yang tidak mengetahui sesungguhnya orang yang berakallah yang dapat menerima pelajaran
2402716 bila aku ditanya di mana allah aku pasti akan menjawab di atas langit
2402717 apakah kamu merasa aman terhadap allah yang di langit bahwa dia akan menjungkirbalikkan bumi bersama kamu atau apakah kamu merasa aman terhadap allah yang di langit bahwa dia akan mengirimkan badai yang berbatu
2402718 barangsiapa yang mengingkari allah azza wa jalla di langit maka ia telah kufur
2402719 allah di atas langit sedang ilmunya pengetahuannya di setiap tempat tidak akan luput sesuatu darinya
2402720 berbicara tentang sunnah yang menjadi peganganku dan para ahli hadits yang saya lihat dan ambil ilmunya seperti sufyan malik dan selain keduanya adalah berikrar bahwa tidak ada ilah yang berhak untuk diibadahi secara benar kecuali allah dan bahwa muhammad adalah utusan allah serta bersaksi bahwa allah itu di atas arsy di langit
2402721 apakah allah di atas langit yang ke tujuh di atas arsynya jauh dari makhluknya sedangkan kekuasaannya dan pengetahuannya di setiap tempat
2402722 ya dia di atas arsynya tidak akan luput sesuatupun darinya
2402723 ini adalah pendapat ucapan para imam imam islam sunnah dan jamaah bahwa kita mengenal rabb kita di atas langit yang ke tujuh di atas arsynya
2402724 kepadanyalah naik perkataan yang baik dan amal sholeh yang dinaikkannya
2402725 malaikat malaikat dan jibril naik menghadap kepada tuhannya dalam sehari yang kadarnya lima puluh ribu tahun
2402726 di dalam al qur an terdapat seribu dalil atau bahkan lebih menunjukkan bahwa allah taala tinggi di atas makhluknya
2402727 yakni ilmunya ilmunya meliputi segala hal sedangkan rabb kita di atas arsy

2402734 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2402735 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2402736 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2402737 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2402738 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2402739 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2402740 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2402741 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2402742 i should have known that people would feel that way
2402743 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2402744 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2402745 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2402746 theyre hurting me again and it hurts the same way everytime
2402747 well at least i know where all our stuff is going to end up when i die

2402752 every shakespeare revival should treat the play as if it was brand new and the ink barely dry on the page and until that happens and we have worked out how shakespeare really can be our contemporary in 21st century britain maybe we should do him a favour and give him a rest
2402753 if i have to depend on the government to support my art maybe i need to improve my skills and work on producing art that will interest private supporters
2402754 those that are present relay the message of what i have said to those that are absent perchance they may better understand it

2402914 papa says he is bringing some guests sir thomas sterley and some of his children i do hope there are some young ladies in the party
2402915 i am sure there might be some young ladies in the party
2402916 indeed that would be such a pleasure to have some new company here some one who has been to london i was so long last in london that i have quite forgotten how it was mayhap the young ladies of the party will have some new dresses and news of the latest fashions in the capital
2402917 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2402918 his affair is his business but to do it in between 04 and 08 shows absolutely terrible judgment further that he lied about it during a campaign has made him unelectable his political career is over which he seemed to acknowledge i also am not convinced the child is not his because he has no explanation for why he was with this woman again two years after he claimed that he told his family about the affair edwards doesnt get to pick the jury this time so his story is a lot harder to sell

2402928 ive seen it before and ill see it again do you 2 know how to dive
2402929 we took a course at the y i guess we should have also made sure neither of us got seasick either
2402930 they came here last year they told us all about the diving was great and the boat and you and and the knife
2402931 ill tell you where i got this knife i got i from the pits of hell
2402932 many years ago a buddy of mine jean guy and i were just starting this business
2402933 aye one day much like today with those clouds far off but threatenin just the same we went out to dive we got a few hundred feet down and out of nowhere comes his shark he grabs onto my arm and old jean guy takes his little knife out and tries to get the thing off of me next thing i know my arm is gone and the monster is on to jean guy and is tossing him back and forth like a rag doll i swim away and get the bends but that bastard shark was too busy with my friend to come after the rest of me that day i looked into the jaws of hell he got his souvenir
2402934 took my friend and my arm and this knife will make sure he never takes anything else from me ever again ill never dive alone ill never dive without this

2402938 oh tom what is it now another verse that you cannot find an ending to
2402939 no mama i have decided that it is time that i take a wife and i need your help deciding on who the fortunate young woman will be
2402940 indeed mama i am most serious otherwise i would not have sort you out to ask for your assistance
2402941 i have not yet set my mind upon any particular lady as the thought only occurred to me this very morning
2402942 i shall have to write to a number of our relatives and hear which of there daughters are of marriageable age
2402943 mama please do and may i make so bold as to ask only those of a clear dispersion further more they should have a large dowry
2402944 i am lead to understand that there might be the possibility of certain commons in the royal dragoons
2402945 indeed there are a certain number available to worthy members of a certain good families for a not inconsiderable consideration
2402946 i would be most interested your grace to know what such a commission would cost say a lieutenantcy or a captaincy
2402947 i am not exactly sure sir thomas but i would be able to find out from the commander of the dragoons he owes me a certain service
2402948 my boy tom is of a moody nature who spends to much time writing poetry and prose i have half a mind to by him a commission and give him a chance to get out in the world dont you know
2402949 ah i have just the right command for a young lad like that
2402950 i see that sir grenville has been mentioned in the latest dispatches
2402951 ah yes grenville he is a wonderful boy going into the army was the best thing i could ever have arranged for him of course he fought and screamed against it he wanted to go into the theater of all things what a member if the nobility in the theater have you ever heard of such an idea
2402952 i blame his mother of course always encouraging him to act
2402953 i fear that it was seeing his uncle of shadberry in the company of the prince regent that put such a notion in his head as you know john shadberry has always followed the fashion of prinny and as a result this has rubbed of on grenville but i knew the army would make a man of him
2402954 it says here that he performed with the utmost bravery when leading a contingent of the rifles whilst with drawing from an open position
2402955 indeed the lad seems to have found his place in the service
2402956 pray sir thomas i am confounded sir that you would want your lad in the army for i believe that you are a navel man yourself
2402957 indeed your grace is correct i fought at cape st vincent the first battle of course yes i meditated upon the navy for my son however since nelson was killed there hasnt been much of a chance of honors at sea with most of the war effort going on land
2402958 exactly sir you are correct in that assumption for the glory now days is not at sea but on the many fronts on the continent dont you know said the earl as he swallowed the cognac
2402959 my service to the crown during my tears at sea also taught me one thing that some men will never make good sailors poor thomas cannot even get out on the lake with out becoming green about the gills thus i am forced to turn once more landward
2402960 indeed sir thomas you have my sympathy but we have time to consider this matter latter tonight i have a little celebration of my own i would like you to attend as my guest for my daughter virginia is to marry captain sir francis wartonsmith and they are to announce there betrothal tonight it would be my pleasure sir if you would attend
2402961 your grace is to kind i await this occasion with much pleasure pray your grace at what time will the event begin
2402962 you must bring arbela to visit us at oakland park i am sure the children would love to have there cousin here sir thomas is away in london at present and is not expected back for a few more weeks thus it would be a grand occasion should you and arbela be here when he returned
2402963 i have written to lady fitz gibbon asking her to visit with us and to bring her daughter lady arbela for a few weeks
2402964 oh mama that is a nice thing i can hardly remember when last they spent time here
2402965 pray tell dear what has miss austen to say in her latest literary offering
2402966 i have often found some amusement in the writings of mrs burney you will of course remember her earlier works
2402967 of course miss austen writes in a style some what akin to that of mrs burney replied lady ann
2402968 i have often wondered at women who have taken up the pen so to say it is not quite the thing for a young lady to do
2402969 oh mary you do say the strangest things miss austen is no longer a young lady she must be quite forty if a day
2402970 when i am older i will write said sophia who was not quite fifteen
2402971 i think i will write of far away places of strange people of the lords and ladies of foreign parts just the think to keep ones interest
2402972 you most certainly shall not my dear you will be a good wife mother and keep your home in order when you are married to a fine gentleman of the county replied lady sarah
2402973 dear aunt sarah we are living at a time when things are so much changed one wonders what people ever did before
2402974 stuff of nonsense said lady sarah it is a womans place to keep a good home it is quite one thing to be a spinster with no prospects living on your wits and the patronage of others and quite another thing to be a respectable member of the aristocracy
2402975 take dear arbela she knows her place i have instructed her in all the things she needs to know about the household she knows how to order the meals from the cook and what to do in the event of any occasion she my dear will make a grand lady i an quite sure that it wont be long before the young bucks will be beating a path to the proverbial door for her hand in marriage
2402976 really ann i am surprised at you r daughters i would have expected them to be most content to be economic with there flights of fancy
2402977 sarah you need not worry on account of my girls they are like flowers in a garden they are a little wild i must confess but with a bit of trimming the should do splendidly
2402978 more new from london i do so hope he is coming soon
2402979 i wonder at sir thomas what does he think of us that he stays so long away and the matter of the business which he went to london must be concluded quite some time ago
2402980 mama there is a hack approaching the house said john who was standing at the window
2402981 now that is welcome i have not spoken to mrs holder in quite while and she has the most delightful recipe for sweetmeats
2402982 tom you will please take an interest in what mr holder tells you and be as civil as you can you know how disagreeable that man can be
2402983 yes mama i think i might show him the gun room he has always shown an interest in the guns said tom
2402984 mr holder would you accompany me to the gun room i have some thing to show you
2402985 indeed young tom that would be my pleasure said the man placing his empty cup on the tray following the younger man out of the room
2402986 pray tell me elizabeth what new recipe have you to share with us lydia pray write down what mrs holder says
2402987 i have a recipe for pork lion chops done in the catalina style
2402988 well what a splendid gun this is said william holder as he handled the weapon which had last seen service in the reign of charles i of blessed memory a flintlock pistol with fine engraving
2402989 my father has always held that this particular weapon was used by one of our more illustrious ancestors sir james sterley who was on the side of the king
2402990 here is fathers sword the one he used while in service eat st vincent he has quite retired the old thing it takes a place of honor here in the gun room may i offer you a glass of port
2402991 that would be most welcome said william holder who was eyeing the ancient weapon with envious eyes wondering how long the money from the sale of the weapon would keep him in the necessities of life

2402994 i wish i was little again where nothing was expected out of me except a cute giggle
2402995 i love l a because you can make your own rules and live in your own world in new york you walk down the street and you immediately see ten people you know but here you can be so much more anonymous growing up in l a the star factor was also really amusing to me and had alot to do with shaping my career as a photographer my mom is a dental hygienist who cleans alot of movie stars teeth when i was young id be doing my homework at her office and would meet people like tom cruise bruce springsteen nicole kidman and ozzy osborne because shed be cleaning their teeth that was cool the worst thing about l a is the traffic and i try to avoid as many bad things as possible in my life so i dont drive i love not having a car in l a i just got an amazing bicycle from puma and ride it everywhere its good on gas joke and its good exercise lastly i love the supermarkets because theyre super competetive and so theyre open all night when i do my shopping i use coupons and it takes me a while but i end up saving over fifty bucks on my order
2402996 i grew up back and forth between l a and hawaii my dad lived in l a my mom in hawaii i love l a because when i was born i was told i loved l a i can never leave here for more than a month new york is a little too fast for me and not green enough and maui is way too slow but l a is right in the middle and i live in malibu so its sort of the best of both worlds a beach town but twenty minutes away from the action the entertainment business and its history are in the air buzzing around you when youre driving down the highway i think l a is really cool right now what with all the music coming out of here i think cities have their time and i think l a is having its time right now

2403007 ah any minute now i suppose maybe she was up all nite waiting for him to come home again
2403008 its really a shame the way he runs around on her
2403009 but the last year or so shes really let herself go i saw her a few weeks ago at the open market and it didnt look like shed washed her hair in days let alone run a brush through it she looked like a wild woman just come down from her own little jello tree
2403010 and she doesnt keep herself up either she looks like she rolls around in the laundry basket in the morning to get dressed and pale youd think she was sick eat a sandwich and get some sun girl
2403011 well you have to keep yourself up for your husbands sake theyre just men after all
2403012 why just the other day my neighbour rachel the one with the dog i was telling you

2403014 that was sunday i remember because just after church and i said to harold see i told
2403015 maybe i should have canceled our little garden party today
2403016 its a tulip bulb after we plant it itll come back every year on its own
2403017 she just excused herself to the little girls room the baby was probably doing the cha cha on her bladder

2403019 i was just checking on her actually the poor thing she went into labor last nite i
2403020 i im sorry virginia to interrupt but what do you mean an awful noise
2403021 w well you know some yowling i suppose why i remember when i was having joshua i was screaming and groaning like a
2403022 but cats normally make hardly any noise at all maybe theres something wrong
2403023 oh i hope not i had no idea that anything could be wrong
2403024 you want me to take a look at her ive seen plenty of kittens being born

2403062 if the the journal you are seeking you should contact their greenfield medical library
2403063 in the end when we look at our life the questions will be simple did i live fully did i love well

2403065 the whole colony is feeling the famine ive even heard the queen is acting funny shes been quiet and you know as well as me that production is down
2403066 scout goes out every day sister lasiyel tells me of these things
2403067 callows theyre barely out of the nursery and you should be teaching them the way not encouraging them risking the health of the whole colony
2403068 well at least there was a rally call this morning food should be on its way
2403069 i thought there was a rally call how could there still be no food
2403070 only a bit and unaksah will just give it to the upper caste
2403071 no we all share together one to one to one it is the way
2403072 ah rynakha you just dont know what it is you live here in the nursery doing your
2403073 but unaksahs lost the way thats why were in this famine unaksah risked our lives
2403074 well your concern for the diggers is admirable one for all but youll be scout soon
2403075 yes but if the colony dies before then from starvation then the food store i know about
2403076 i was out collecting last week and i wandered off the scent trail
2403077 i was driven by fear fear for the colony for all these new sisters
2403078 and it drove me to act against my better judgment lasiyel dropped her head and knelt on her front knees in mock shame nurse rynakha
2403079 well your heart was in the right place but tell me more about the food
2403080 and so youve always known the pleasure of honor always known your importance to the colony this is my chance finally to serve the way
2403081 shell never listen to me shes proud and single minded and shes leading us all to doom i cant let it happen we cant let it happen why should we all be hungry weak tired one more day when if i was scout we would all be delivered
2403082 well there is one way but i hate to say it
2403083 well for the good of the colony maybe unaksah should be eliminated
2403084 i i thought i saw abnormality but uh it was just dirt
2403085 you could have exposed me my treason but you didnt you must see the wisdom of what i am saying tell me you see that its the only way
2403086 id need help you have to help me wed be saviors to everyone youd be the ultimate
2403087 youve already broken with orthodoxy you lied to ticanyel youve already broken
2403088 just listen its simple the next time old unaksah sends me to forage after one of her
2403089 but ive never been on any but the biggest rallys im a nurse not just a worker
2403090 but you are just a worker yes you are the highest rank of
2403091 but how will you call rally do delayed after coming here
2403092 those details will work themselves out we have time think it over we have to wait

2403100 i thought you were going to tell me you spent all your money at the lingerie shop buying over priced bum covers and didnt have enough left over for your lamb i am happy youre going to actually eat some meat youre too skinny and what good are all those underpants when all you have is a bony arse to put in them men like a bit of bum sue

2403106 did not really want to walk through the match and didnt know what the hell he was doing
2403107 one of the great young talents out there he was a guy who was destined to be champion i love to really watch edge work he really works like a heel
2403108 i am surprised then that it would eventually be chosen by the almighty to be given the chance to redeem myself by offering a place to the chosen one but what did i do i messed it up and ended up becoming the eternal jew
2403109 has the lord not given you the opportunity since then to redeem yourself
2403110 was there when benedict stuart the last grand son of james ii died it was pitiful he had of course given up the hope many years earlier of regaining the throne of all of the stuarts he seemed to be the most realistic of them but alas he chosen path was the church of rome and he died childless
2403111 after that little episode i sort of lost interest returned to serve england in the capacity of a spy during the french revolution and then later during the reign of napoleon that is how i first began to gather a fortune from which the hotel empire i now own came
2403112 i was there the day the lopped of the head of marie antoinette poor pitiful creature she was at the end but the crowd cheered and hooted at the poor womans final predicament it was then that i once more began to search for a means to find my salvation it was not an easy time for me and i think i was also much in avoidance of the new enlightenment but that is how history is thus i set out to some how find a way to redeem myself
2403113 so you have seen the church in all its forms up to the present age and you still avoid returning or rather should i say joining the church of christ because of what you have witnessed through the ages asked chris
2403114 i have seen many things in the course of history however the happiest time for me was back at the end of the third century ad when i lived in greece i had gone there totally disillusioned and wanted nothing to do with god or religions but i had a friend demetrious a wine merchant of sorts who in later life converted to christianity he had been a great worshiper of the greek gods but events of the time lead him to turn to christianity and he became one of the elders of the church i remember a few days before he died he came to visited me and he implored me to turn to jesus christ but i was having to much fun enjoying the young body of a greek slave girl and i was not over much interested but now i regret it i saw the sad look in his eyes as he left me that sunny afternoon in 397 ad his last words to me were
2403115 how did you first become aware that the curse placed on you had taken affect
2403116 when i was alive for about fifty years i began to notice that i had stopped aging my wife was already an old woman with white hair while i was still a robust health 35 year old man
2403117 do you not think that it might be better if you accept christ and bring your long journey to an end
2403118 indeed i do but the method of this salvation what puzzles me for i have been a member of the christian church before and membership has not brought my predicament to an end
2403119 i dont speak of church membership samuel i speak of a giving of your self to the will and commands of jesus a complete handing over of your life to christ i am sure this is the truth so simple which has alluded you for these many long years
2403120 for surly there must be some thing which is different in this surrender which has caused me to live for so long
2403121 we will have to think about that and pray said chris
2403122 no tom it is all the rage and is played in all the best houses in london we simple must have one
2403123 indeed my love and how much do you suppose such an extravagance would cost
2403124 oh i am not sure but what is the matter you have never been so obstinate before when it came to the purchase of an instrument
2403125 indeed we have recently had the man in to tune the harpsichord and what of the new fiddle i bought john but a twelve month ago
2403126 that is a good point my dear he said with a smile let me consider it and when i have found the right conclusion i will let you know
2403127 in the mean time pray tell me what are the young ladies up to this evening for i believe there is to be a assemble in the village and i have yet to shave and dress for i should very much like to wait upon some of our neighbors at the assembly
2403128 why sir one would think that you of all people would dismiss out of hand any frivolity with assemblies for you have grown quite in your later years what now this sudden interest in assembles and balls pray sir what bedbug have you in your hat
2403129 indeed i do sir replied mr parker taking a pull at his pipe
2403130 ah yes i remember well how we fought that battle under the moon light a singular even if i might say so sir thomas
2403131 and our ship our faithful montague is already and old war horse now i would not be surprised that when next we hear of her she will have been broken up or a sheer hulk
2403132 i fancy the lower deck crews would not look back at her with such an air of nostalgia
2403133 indeed i fancy don de l ngara will also look back at that battle with an air of discontent
2403134 i am sure my amy would be delighted to spend an afternoon in the company of your good lady
2403135 pray tell how are those bright young sons of yours
2403136 george has recently returned from oxford and is taking the business of my rents in hand quite nicely it relieves me to have some time upon my hands to be at leisure
2403137 peter is bound for the service this coming fortnight monday
2403138 indeed a strange choose replied sir thomas raising an eyebrow it was i am afraid the best that can be got at present he is no horseman unfortunately i would have liked to get him a commission in the guards but he refused to hear of it preferring to be among the men as he put it
2403139 dear husband remind me later to impart to you a certain knowledge that has of resent been rewarded me
2403140 indeed it must be of some importance that you would not speak before our dear and old friend mr parker
2403141 no sir it is some what of a private nature and is fit only for the ear of a husband
2403142 said lady ann with a frown on her broad face for she was watching with some manner of displeasure the figure of her daughter lydia and young peter parker who to her mind seemed a little to closely embraced in each others arms
2403143 ann let them be we were once young dont you recall said sir thomas

2403161 es mentira porque soy yo yo invado el alma de las persona de repente pasa una dulce chica con los ojos sollozos estaba llorando sin desconsolaci n tristeza la ve muy triste se acerca aquella chica y le pregunta
2403162 claro que no es por tristeza por lo que ella llora debe ser la soledad que habita en su interior debe sentirse abandonada y desesperada por mi la soledad te guiara a la oscuridad de nuevo empezaron a discutir los dos para ver cual era el mejor entonces la chica les dijo
2403163 cual era ese sentimiento que era peor que los juntos

2403169 i remember when you were a baby maybe 2 or three you werent such a good walker at that point you were always trying to go too fast and always falling down

2403171 i figure that being a teenager is probably like that except instead of starting to move physically you start of move emotionally you know what it mean
2403172 i guess what im trying to say is that there may be a lot of emotional stumbles

2403301 kami menegaskan bahawa majlis peguam tidak ada hak untuk memandai mandai dan cuba membahaskan hal yang berkaitan dengan undang undang islam secara terbuka
2403302 kami mendesak supaya forum ini dihentikan oleh pihak berkuasa kerana ia boleh membawa kepada kemarahan masyarakat islam yang tidak mahu undang undang islam dicabar oleh mana mana pihak
2403303 tindakan berkenaan adalah suatu usaha yang terancang yang disusun oleh pihak tertentu untuk secara berterusan mempertikaikan hak hak yang terkandung dalam perlembagaan terhadap islam
2403304 kami memberi amaran kepada majlis peguam agar menghentikan segera penganjuran forum berkenaan atau menghadapi tindakan penentangan serius umat islam di negara ini
2403305 justeru kami mahu perbincangan terbuka persoalan yang sensitif ini dihentikan segera

2403403 do you think the frivolous jeering tone of your campaign matches the problems being faced by this country and the sacrifices being made right now by our soldiers overseas
2403404 i think the focus early on should be put on math because without math skills you dont have the knowledge to do everyday things i also think the math program should be focused to what math skills youre going to use in a job
2403405 i dont think they should say ok you have to take pre calculus because you want to be a nurse youre not going to use pre calculus in nursing youre going to use certain skills in math but not the whole subject i dont think its necessary i think math programs should be more specialized

2403413 there has been a tendency in several reports to portray the prevailing situation in the occupied territories as more of a conflict between two equal sides the israeli and palestinian rather than actually one of occupation
2403414 certain language usage that overlooks the existence of this occupation is unacceptable
2403415 for sometime now the delegation of palestine has been troubled by misrepresentations in several u n reports in the recent period including some issued by the secretary general that have had the effect of skewing the context of the situation in the occupied palestinian territory including east jerusalem
2403416 why should i fight this battle whats in it for me
2403417 bill one of our general managers is an idiot i believe my friend on that observation not because hes a friend but because ive known people like the guy hes referring to and he is making decisions on an ongoing basis that while insulating his own p amp l from additional overtime costs by shutting down his plant during the day is knowingly and intentionally transferring his o t savings into higher costs for another department by forcing them to buy product for the companys energy customers from other producers at a premium charge due to the fact they are being purchased at peak demand rates we are talking about his department saving a few thousand dollars and the companys energy customers taking a beating in the hundreds of thousands of dollars from fuel costs that are passed through to the customer ive spoken to him about this several times but he refuses to do whats right shut his plant down at night for maintenance when energy demand is low and ive shown him how much hes costing customers but he says thats not his problem this gm my friend continued has been in place for a long time and his boss and his boss boss must agree that hes the right man for the job as they dont seem to be in a rush to replace him and although i have the numbers in hand that prove his decisions are wrong my department is currently lacking a boss so if i go to the general managers boss to make my case it is clear that i will be punching at windmills at two and three levels above me so whats in it for me his bosses must know by now hes not the smartest general manager in the group but they obviously like him and therefore absent a current boss who will fight this fight for me and at a level commensurate with the gms boss why should i risk alienating two vice presidents that i have to deal with on other matters and on a regular basis

2403427 this is a generalization because there are always good movies that pop up

2403445 and i grabbed his wallet on accident and he took mine we said our apologies and quickly left soon did i try to look for my keys i realized that this was not my wallet i panicked
2403446 you know how it is theres so many people here in new york what are the chances of running into and recognizing that same person
2403447 fortunately for don and his great memory span he was soon asking people around the spot where we ran into each other describing my looks and the manager of exodus cafe knew who he was asking for me
2403448 don soon found out where i lived and when he found me i was sitting outside locked out of my own apartment we shared a laugh that night and everything magical started from today
2403449 i expected him not to your friend had a pristine persona he never wanted anyone that he cared about to be worried about him

2403803 a swedish heavy metal fan has had his musical preferences officially classified as a disability the results of a psychological analysis enable the metal lover to supplement his income with state benefits
2403804 i have been trying for ten years to get this classified as a handicap
2403805 i spoke to three psychologists and they finally agreed that i needed this to avoid being discriminated against
2403806 i signed a form saying roger feels compelled to show his heavy metal style this puts him in a difficult situation on the labour market therefore he needs extra financial help so now i can turn up at a job interview dressed in my normal clothes and just hand the interviewers this piece of paper

2403812 the emerging technologies hype cycle covers the entire it spectrum but we aim to highlight technologies that are worth adopting early because of their potentially high business impact
2403813 many of the web 2 0 phenomenon have already reshaped the web in the consumer world
2403814 companies need to establish how to incorporate consumer technologies in a secure and effective manner for employee productivity and also how to transform them into business value for the enterprise
2403815 the pairing of each hype cycle with a priority matrix will help organisations to better determine the importance and timing of potential investments based on benefit rather than just hype
2403816 be selectively aggressive identify which technologies could benefit your business and evaluate them earlier in the hype cycle
2403817 for technologies that will have a lower impact on your business let others learn the difficult lessons and adopt the technologies when they are more mature

2403873 i like not making a negative impact on the earth

2403875 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
2403876 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
2403877 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
2403878 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating

2403883 hey you guys arent allowed to swim here they dont allow you people
2403884 when you grow up as a stateless person you never experience that and that was back in my head all the time when i was growing up
2403885 i really heard a lot songs from elder tibetans thats what they brought with them they brought objects and things from tibet but theres no life i can see the music was that kind of life i can feel it
2403886 and there was a little section of tibet it was less than 3 minutes
2403887 i have to do this i really told myself i have to do this
2403888 i was really shocked because the first sound i heard was chinese music coming from everywhere from the stores loudspeakers
2403889 the sound is totally chinese and then finally when i went into the countryside i found what i was looking for i was really inspired that they still can sing despite all that they went through when i saw them smile it was really inspiring
2403890 there are songs about every activity you do in daily life while you work to build the house songs for weddings songs to sing while drinking songs to sing while you are milking songs to sing while you are churning the butter there songs for everything
2403891 i saw the truck vanish leaving me with these nine police i thought i will never be able to go back there
2403892 prison is not a place where you want to go but it is a place where you have time to think it is not a place where you want to die but it is a place where you can transform yourself
2403893 im very very comfortable now as a tibetan than i was before
2403894 and the land of snow is overcast and suffering because of my past negative karma i may have to go through this oh lord but there may be an end to this
2403895 not for tibet not for china but for the entire world to solve the issue of tibet through non violence with whats happening in the world right now the growing anger all over the world i think that we can give our world an example
2403896 and a certain back stretch that i do at this age
2403897 it makes absolutely no sound fortunately if its making noise im in big trouble
2403898 i sit on a bench right forearm on my right knee and twist and then of course i do the other side took a couple years of practice to get that straight
2403899 i saw all these boats you know singles doubles quads people from all over the world and they were big and they were strong and they were fast i just thought this is unbelievable i thought i knew this sport and i was looking at a fishbowl and theres a whole ocean out there
2403900 he had angular features and these kind of hawk like eyes and short cropped hair i think we all did in those days
2403901 i did have hair in those days and ive got pictures to prove it my dear
2403902 sy said to me youre going to be racing ivanov
2403903 ivanov passed me with five hundred to go and he greeted me very warmly after that he gave me his shirt i gave him my shirt
2403904 i spent july and august two solid months rowing twice a day each workout was six 500 meter pieces the last three i would crank it up like the last 500 meters and it was brutal it was so hard and every time i did it i would think of ivanov passing me
2403905 we get to tokyo and my heat had ivanov and me flat water it was perfect conditions
2403906 my mental image was the water started to froth under his boat
2403907 if spero wins it will be quite an upset last 500 meters ivanov is taking his sprint lets see if spero can match it
2403908 we came charging into that last 500 and i thought its just like its supposed to be im holding him hes not gonna get me and with about 10 strokes to go he realized he wasnt gonna get me and he stopped he actually stopped rowing its the best race i ever rowed in my life
2403909 it was the wrong time because it was the heats not the final
2403910 when i crossed that line i was elated of course hot damn im the world champion
2403911 ivanov never changed he was sort of shouting we should race we do 500 meter race and everybodys looking around saying nah we finished beating up on each other you know this is for fun not ivanov he sits in his boat shoves off and he gets this defiant sort of snarl in his face and i swear to god he took a racing start off the float boom boom boom boom boom like he was about to go out and row the finals of the olympics it was incredible it was beautiful it was perfect he took about 15 strokes almost had a coronary attack that was it
2403912 its a basis for saying im going to be confident about this sport go out and enjoy it but ive never felt that i had to row to prove anything because i already did that
2403913 i felt most comfortable leading and id run from the front my entire career so to try and do something different in the olympics from a personal standpoint was really stupid
2403914 some people think she tripped me deliberately i happen to know that wasnt the case at all
2403915 more people in this country and in the world took notice of a womens track event because of what happened and people remember the person that fell its not like well didnt you win a medal or what medal did you win its like they know i fell
2403916 i didnt know because i didnt want to compete to make history i wanted to compete to be the best
2403917 but its not even close to what you feel when you look back its so hard to do something in life today that people tell you i remember that moment 32 years ago and i remember where i was and with who i was and its you dont know that when youre fourteen now it feels huge
2403918 i feel like at home and whole world is mine i loved that this is what i loved about the olympic games it was like a big family
2403919 i always afraid to do that but i always did it good
2403920 i felt when i did it i fly like no bars no beam just air
2403921 if you win audience this is biggest medal in your life if audience love you everybody will love you

2403923 owing to the lower multiple commanded by the pipe division pending dilution for pil and higher interest costs we are revising our target price downwards to rs 248 rs 299 consequently we also downgrade our rating on the stock from buy to accumulate

2403927 it was 25 years ago probably my brother and some friends were out in a bay north of town water skiing and i was in the water and i saw something surface near the boat it was as long as the boat it was a 16 foot boat it was black it was ugly it was long serpent like i would say i saw something im not going to tell you its pepie but im not going to tell you it wasnt
2403928 we were the only boat out there the lake was smooth as glass we saw a wake about a foot and a half two feet high and about two hundred feet long going down the lake
2403929 on april 28 1871 the minnesota state historical society has an entry in their almanac book of days that says a lake monster was seen swimming on lake pepin
2403930 the reward is a 50 000 reward you have to have a picture of pepie along with some sort of sample off of pepie like a snippet of a fin or something like that so we can send it up to the university of minnesota biology department
2403931 theres no evidence to suggest that theres not sea monsters either
2403932 we know pepies never harmed anybody so he must be a pretty nice creature so he probably doesnt have big fangs or anything hes probably got a grinning face and hes maybe a vegetarian
2403933 sounds like he would lend himself well to the type of cartoons that might be printed on t shirts that are for sale
2403934 well you just never know what might happen here in the next couple of months
2403935 its not intended for pepie its intended for people to munch on while youre looking for pepie
2403936 but theres a lot of things i havent seen so that doesnt mean he doesnt exist just because i havent seen him

2403948 heres the thing though some people might think thats blasphemy but its going to taste great im not trying to pull the wool over anyones eyes if were cooking kick ass food thats all that matters carmen hit me up with some garlic here
2403949 after cooking and prepping for 12 hours you look around and its a mess and youre like oh my god i gotta clean and you get through that with a few beers maybe a couple shots whatevers hiding in funkensteins locker
2403950 this must be what you wanted like a house wants to be haunted

2404020 training wheels are potentially the least painful way to learn to ride a bike but also the slowest they make the most sense for families who live on very quiet safe streets without hills to make good use of training wheels you need a safe flat driveway or wide sidewalk or other place where a child can ride with a minimum of supervision a bike with training wheels can be even more dangerous than a tricycle because the child is higher up and the base width of the training wheels is fairly narrow this means that if the bike gets going much faster than a walk it will topple over if the child tries to turn a corner also if the bike is turning even a little bit weight is shifted from the rear wheel to the outside training wheel so the braking power of the rear wheel is greatly reduced most people that use training wheels have them adjusted incorrectly the bike should always have a little bit of lean if both training wheels can touch the ground at once there is little weight on the bicycles rear wheel this can reduce traction to zero on uneven ground the child may get stuck because the wheel spins even worse the brake may become useless when the bike is new there should be only a small amount of tilt from one side to the other after the child has become accustomed to pedaling steering and braking the training wheels should be raised slightly a bit at a time it is probably better to do this without telling the child who may object the bike will become more and more tippy and the child will learn to balance automatically with practice as the child becomes more adept the bike will spend more and more time with both training wheels off the ground the day will come when it is obvious that the training wheels are no longer doing anything and they can be removed if the training wheels are left set on their lowest position the bike is in effect an oversized tricycle and some kids spend two or three years on training wheels as a result this is not only a waste of their time it is really quite dangerous as they learn to ride faster and faster because of the poor cornering and braking of a training wheel equipped bike eventually the child will become heavy enough to bend the training wheel struts upward making the bike suitably tippy then they will finally learn to balance
2404021 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2404022 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices

2404223 mitigate the risks to manufactured housing residents and communities resulting from tornados
2404224 that instrument sometimes called the father of chinese music or even the instrument of the sages
2404225 thats right bob and its important to recognize that in chinese culture the image and the artist are one you know the chinese invented paper and printing
2404226 this symbol for harmony evokes a profound confucian philosophy there it is again harmony making its third appearance there
2404227 well any chinese wouldnt need a calendar to know what time frame were in the great opening when people were able to bring color in their lives and live exactly as they chose
2404228 harmony of the tai chi master is the only hope for sustainable development of china and the way in which the world faces the challenges of global warming including the conflicts of man and nature and the importance of environmentalism

2404237 all that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing
2404238 it is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator all the perpetrator asks is that the bystander do nothing he appeals to the universal desire to see hear and speak no evil the victim on the contrary asks the bystander to share the burden of pain the victim demands action engagement and remembering
2404239 essentially we have two full time jobs to look after when you add family on to that it makes things difficult
2404240 theres not as many people working here in the community to become volunteers in summerfield
2404241 we as a fire department have to find what entices people in order to bring them here and keep them here
2404242 the requirements to become a volunteer firefighter are more stringent
2404243 its especially tough on someone who is married and has a family to become a volunteer fitts said
2404244 they are looking at a year of classes two times a week and on saturdays the good ol boy system to become a volunteer is gone
2404245 more calls will mean more paid firefighters as mostly rural areas become mostly urban
2404246 as areas continue to get annexed more people will mean more costs well have to hire more paid people
2404247 but i come from the volunteer side and i dont want to get rid of that that is what this department was built on
2404248 its got enough complexity that people can play it and enjoy it for many hours at the same time if youre just a casual user you can run through and play the game and have fun with it everything you see in the developer levels you can create as the player

2404255 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2404256 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2404257 saya pernah datang kepada nabi saw yang sedang mengalami demam maka saya bertanya rasulullah mengapa anda tampak sangat demam beliau menjawab
2404258 but we didnt want too big of a space and be stuck with it or too small of it
2404259 i was just really surprised at all the services they offered and support they could give me for a fledgling business
2404260 theres always excitement when you see other new businesses even though theyre doing nothing like what were doing
2404261 and likewise its encouraging to see that even out of that middle step you can take the plunge into more corporate america

2404271 had never heard of a client called apex financial group and we have received several recent calls for other interested parties
2404272 and here is how you get to it let me show you
2404273 lebron james missed his third straight game tuesday night because of his sprained left index finger
2404274 we didnt know that this was going to hit us this quick
2404275 people will say its the economy during bad economic times people gravitate to colleges and universities so they dont have to look for a job some of that could be going on here
2404276 we went up there salivating amp ellipses opened the door and there were like four pieces left

2404282 the ceremony that opened the 29th olympic games last night outdid all of its predecessors in numbers colour noise and expense demonstrating to the world that the new china intends to make its presence felt
2404283 olympics the power and the glary china leaves world aswestruck
2404284 the world saw china as it sees itself and as it wants to be seen by the world
2404285 beijing china didnt just walk onto the world stage it soared over it at last playing its long sought role as olympic host china opened the summer games in spectacular fashion friday with an extravaganza of fireworks and pageantry dramatizing its ascendance as a global power
2404286 awesome fridays opening ceremony was one of the few moments in the fantastical world of sports when superlatives had no shot brilliant powerful gripping take your pick string them all together and they cant exaggerate this one
2404287 maybe the only way to understand how fulfilling the 2008 opening ceremony was is to think four years in advance to the 2012 games and pity the city of london the planning committee from those games was in attendance last night and you can bet whoever is in charge of the ceremony there was sitting on a floor with his head in his hands
2404288 you know an olympics has gotten off on the right foot when the torch lighting ceremony really grabs you
2404289 in the end we are told little more than that the level of scrutiny employed to strike down the texas law applies only when illegal alien children are deprived of a public education if ever a court was guilty of an unabashedly result oriented approach this case is a prime example
2404290 the fact that there are sound policy arguments against the texas legislatures choice does not render that choice an unconstitutional one
2404291 he was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
2404292 its over now this time im telling you the truth
2404293 i dont know i dont know who that baby is
2404294 well it looks like me but it could have been photoshopped do you know how many babies ive held in the last two years
2404295 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2404296 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us
2404297 think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism
2404298 does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2404299 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2404300 conservatives would be pissed as hell i think you would have a revolt but sometimes john does what john wants to do
2404301 you couldnt have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of check and balances at cbs and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas writing

2404310 she asks for an end to the voyeurism of the media as they continue the repair work they began in 2006
2404311 little piece of reality that changed the whole primaries and most likely everyones future life
2404312 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2404313 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2404314 if he would lie to his wife do you think he would have any problem whatsoever lying to the rest of us
2404315 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2404316 if you lie and get called on it you may as well have shot heroin youre history

2404322 you come into my woods for any reason professional or not you call and get permission from now on i dont care if youre just coming out to eat at that new korean place you get a fucking hall pass
2404323 and we both agree that the best way for you yoyos to do penance is to find out who the hell popped the family bowl
2404324 you haul those jokers in and youll be clean in my eyes fail and youll find me less and less likely to give you the benefit of the doubt
2404325 the song is technically called flashdance parentheses what a feeling i think
2404326 jesus would they let an 8 year old sing it otherwise
2404327 i dont know if it was a release of emotion or it just was everybodys chance to get some free shots in on me i think guys were taking advantage of giving me some rib shots and some jabs
2404328 im always celebrating everybodys elses at home plate and to get to be the one that jumps into the pile is pretty fun
2404329 the u s role in iraq liberator occupier or peacekeeper
2404330 not yet reached a point in my rehab where my participation in a debate would accurately reflect my capabilities
2404331 most other olympics acquired their label during or after the games usually after emotions had coalesced or a big news event pushed other stories off the front page but the combination of fascination with china and increasingly intense churn of media attention has changed that
2404332 they are well and we will be taking them to bosasso

2404348 here is what ellenm said about me bachmann emailed me
2404349 i suspect there is a non compete scenario with bachmann skaja that could explain why david is out of a job and looking to the county to support him three pieces of silver to sell the family practice was it all worth it

2404354 you may divert a few votes from the republican and thereby help elect a man who has absolutely no respect for the constitution but i have grandchildren who i don t want living under a new fascist regime under hussein obama so i ll be voting for mccain we can recover from mccain but not from obama and dem congress
2404355 this persistent voting for the lesser of two evils is exactly why this country continues to head down in to the abyss
2404356 by the way we are also diverting votes away from the democrats as well
2404357 is to stop exercising the very definition of insanity by doing the same thing over and over yet expecting different results

2404378 were going to go ahead with this because we think its appropriate and if you have a problem with it thats your problem

2404384 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2404385 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2404386 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2404387 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2404388 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2404389 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2404390 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge

2404401 a little religious communication might not be a bad idea at this stage of the game now myself i dont take any chances i talk to mohammed buddha mr jesus h christ himself and any other religious honchos i can come up with
2404402 our lives must become as symbols of christ buddha krishna conversely we must see christ buddha krishna zarathustra in each and every person we come into contact with
2404403 i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it
2404404 i believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings
2404405 it was the message hells best kept secret that set me on fire to evangelize the world i wouldnt be where i am or who i am today without god having spoken to me through that message i spent 3 years doing non stop tract and personal evangelism from the time i first heard the message at 15 years of age until i left to go to peru and china in 2002 after graduating from high school i have now been a missionary for about 5 years in the foothills of tibet ministering to buddhists and muslims i have prayed and longed for the day that hells best kept secret would no longer be the secret that it once was and i am overjoyed to see all that god has done and is still doing
2404406 i want to see some looney tunes in cali like me
2404407 in view of such harmony in the cosmos which i with my limited human mind am able to recognize there are yet people who say there is no god but what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views
2404408 im not an atheist and i dont think i can call myself a pantheist we are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages the child knows someone must have written those books it does not know how it does not understand the languages in which they are written the child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangements of the books but doesnt know what it is that it seems to me is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward god
2404409 strongly held view that consideration of acquitted conduct to enhance a defendants sentence is unconstitutional
2404410 what does it say to our contribution as jurors when we see our verdicts in my personal view not given their proper weight it appears to me that these defendants are being sentenced not on the charges for which they have been found guilty but on the charges for which the u s attorneys office would have liked them to have been found guilty
2404411 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2404412 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2404413 you sure youre up for clubbing dean you are getting kind of old
2404414 i can hold my own just try not to blow me away with all those dance moves you learned on set alright
2404415 alright well ill meet you out front of your office at 8 then
2404416 so where are we going you didnt tell me the name of the club when you called
2404417 youll see its not anything like what you would expect
2404418 nothing were here why do you think i stopped the car
2404419 a gay bar gee whatever gave that away maybe the half naked guys
2404420 yes thats what it is alright why do you have a problem
2404421 well you are a better listener to women than any straight guy ive ever met and you seem to have a pretty good fashion sense so i just sort of thought oh my god im so sorry
2404422 you know laughing at me doesnt make things any better
2404423 geez you think you can judge a person and look where it gets you
2404424 julia if you only knew how wrong you were about me youd be just as embarrassed
2404425 the better question though is how did you even find this place
2404426 i found this place with my girlfriends about three months ago we were driving along on the way back from a party and saw how hopping this place was and just decided to stop we were surprised when we walked in but we actually had a lot of fun you have no idea how nice it is to go clubbing and not have guys staring at you all night
2404427 wouldnt they still be staring at you though since you know you are the only one in here with breasts
2404428 no sometimes there are other girls here but the guys dont seem to mind they are here for each other not for me its nice too the total anonymity here other than the occasional fan coming up gushing about save the last dance
2404429 yeah i suppose it would be no one would think to look for you here
2404430 what you dont dance then let me buy you a drink
2404431 fine have him all you want ms thing just dont expect to get many more like him in that outfit
2404432 not a problem its the least i can do i was the one who brought you here remember
2404433 i have to tell you that guy was right see i knew you were handsome since i first met you but i figured like most hot guys you were gay
2404434 yeah so i never thought about you sexually or anything
2404435 but since i now know ive got a really wicked idea
2404436 i want to have sex right here and right now
2404437 thats whats so nasty about it ive always had this fantasy of having sex in public and i cant think of a better than right here and right now there isnt a single person in here who is going to notice or care
2404438 well i didnt see any booths open back there when we came in how about we keep dancing for a bit and go talk about this in a few minutes when things calm down some
2404439 no no they wont calm down here till the sun comes up besides i dont want to go to a booth i want to do it right here on the dance floor dancing is so erotic anyways and i have to tell you that my pussy has been getting wet just by moving against your crotch what do you say
2404440 id love to but as your agent and thus in charge of your career i must advise against it
2404441 conflict is not what we want to see it is contrary to what the olympic ideals stand for
2404442 the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for

2404448 la gran masa de la poblaci n musulmana est constituida por hispanos convertidos al islam y que al abrazar la religi n de los vencedores han cambiado en realidad poco en su forma ntima de vivir

2404456 una de las formas arquitect nicas de origen andaluz que logr una mayor y m s dilatada difusi n a trav s del arte mud jar fue la b veda nervada b veda que hab a llegado a su m s pleno e inteligente desarrollo en las c pulas con nervios cruzados que se desarrollaron en la mezquita de c rdoba bajo el reinado de al hakam ii su difusi n alcanz varios puntos de la pen nsula catedral de oviedo la del salvador de sep lveda la de jaca etc ejemplos m s completos los encontramos en las c pulas de s miguel de alamaz n soria y de torres del r o navarra edificios completamente rom nicos pero con c pulas enteramente andaluzas con sus arcos por parejas cruzados y su ojo central con cupulilla o linterna
2404457 bien enraizado en el alma popular el mudejarismo persisti durante siglos a trav s de m ltiples transformaciones art sticas m s o menos ex ticas que apenas lo rozaron y en ellas se mantiene latente la afici n a la riqueza decorativa a la profusi n ornamental a la policrom a violenta unida a la repugnancia por todo lo cl sico y equilibrado esperando el momento propicio para crear un nuevo barroquismo

2404776 us could not let the russians get any part of china or japan
2404777 does the above imply that using the h bomb was necessary to beat the soviets to the control of china and japan i e the ultimate goal because the us could not let the russians get any part of china or japan
2404778 it is very bad to kill people by atomic bombs and it is nice to kill them by beheading

2404789 foreign influence because the french administrative system was used to structure the tunisian government when tunisia was governed as a french protectorate the tunisian government supported education system is infused with many of the principles and structures of the french educational system however arabic is currently used as the language of instruction in tunisian public schools with french taught as a second language starting in the third year of primary school and english taught as a third language beginning in the seventh year of school i e the first year of secondary school only fairly recently did arabic become the official language of government in tunisia and french and arabic are both used as languages of commerce other foreign languages are also offered to tunisian students as they proceed through the secondary grades

2404820 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd
2404821 but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
2404822 told us that they had no active weapons of mass destruction program
2404823 the going in assumption was that we were going to war so this nie was to be written with that in mind

2404827 hamdan was convicted based on laws that were passed long after he was picked up and the commission allowed coerced evidence both illegal under not only international law but u s law as well
2404828 hamdans trial revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short so far the trial continues the bush administrations efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
2404829 the trial was a show trial the rules of evidence are so tilted in the governments favor that the tribunal is ill designed for getting at truth
2404830 its hard to credit any verdict though its telling that the executive failed to win the entire case even in its contrived system

2404833 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2404834 the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the uniform code of military justice and the four geneva conventions signed in 1949

2404839 it is against ioc regulations to be propagating political slogans or aiming to create racial hatred
2404840 not only have they breached the ioc regulations they also disturbing other spectators hence they were told to leave and would not be welcome back

2404855 the bbcs rana jawad in tripoli says that as part of the deal the eu is set to significantly ease restrictions on visas for citizens which could see libyans obtain them within 48 hours
2404856 as a result it has put itself on a path that is leading to investment in libya by western companies which could not invest there before i know that american companies are very interested in working in libya
2404857 i sincerely hope that i will be able to visit there soon
2404858 a national childrens helpline says its ready to deal with calls from potter fans who feel unhappy after the last book in the series goes on sale
2404859 the death of any big characters in harry potter and the deathly hallows could be very hard on younger readers death and loss can make children upset angry and afraid
2404860 the story could bring back unhappy memories for children who have lost friends relatives or pets
2404861 one of the studies on primary school age children in baghdad found that nearly half of the 600 children surveyed had experienced a major traumatic event since the war began just over one in every 10 suffered from post traumatic stress disorder the study found another of the studies found that older children in mosul suffered even worse thirty percent of the 1 090 children surveyed showed signs of post traumatic stress disorder nearly all of those with ptsd symptoms 92 percent had not received any treatment according to the study
2404862 many iraqi children have to pass dead bodies on the street as they walk to school in the morning according to a separate report last week by the international red cross
2404863 there i saw a four year old boy sitting beside his mothers body which had been decapitated by the explosion
2404864 he was talking to her asking her what had happened he had been taken out shopping by his mum
2404865 most iraqi people now deal with each other in an aggressive way they show disturbed behaviour they have lost their civility
2404866 the more psychiatrists have earned from drug makers the more they have prescribed a new class of powerful medicines known as atypical antipsychotics to children for whom the drugs are especially risky and mostly unapproved
2404867 why did you go to the doctor because the doctor needs to earn money to live why did you go to the pharmacy with the prescription because the pharmacists also needs to live then why did you discard the medicine because i also want to live
2404868 it is very clear that the senator has been used as a puppet to perpetuate opposition politics
2404869 we earlier thought he was mature in his assessment of kenyan and african politics
2404870 we have evidence that odm odingas party politicians and local leaders actively fomented some post election violence
2404871 in response to the revelations the evangelical alliance of kenya released a statement in which church leaders said raila in both mous comes across as a presumptive muslim president bent on forcing islamic law religion and culture down the throats of the kenyan people in total disregard of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of freedom of worship and equal protection of the law
2404872 concerns raised over alleged vow to enforce islamic law in kenya
2404873 in kimanthis view only some of the leaders were al queda sympathizers the renditions along with frequent police sweeps on the swahili coast had become an emotional issue in the presidential race islamic outrage had placed the incumbent kibaki on the defensive and provided raila odinga with a tool to rally the support of kenyas muslims
2404874 our government will not be held at ransom to extradite muslims to foreign lands
2404875 proximity to the volatile states including somalia and sudan have made kenya especially vulnerable in the views of counterterrorism experts to the call for jihad
2404876 near daily conversations with the us ambassador and raila odinga
2404877 you might think that all kenyans would be vigorously supporting mr
2404878 this is what may be the most memorable effect of the odms odingas party post election campaign for state house the longer their protests last and the less disciplined they are or the more atrocities like eldoret church massacre are conducted in the partys name the more likely kenya is to be stuck on the front pages of the worlds media and the more embarrassment it will bring to the senator
2404879 the least resourced american nation building effort in our history
2404880 nothing less than a western led marshall plan for the region and a commitment that would have to be measured in not months or years but decades
2404881 there is nothing useful in a doubting stubbornness that bitterly says that it will set meaningless conditions upon which to build its pillars so as to understand god and his world a stance that stubbornly demands to find comfort a solution precisely in this small flash of the life of the senses of the circumscribed flesh and spirit in this temporary life that passes like a fleeting shadow that is not the way it is true that the incomplete part is important and worthy the flesh is refined and beloved and the spirit awakens and arises but all of these attain their greatness their radiance only when they yearn radiantly as they face the center of the course of their being which is given prominence only because it has been carved out in a divine manner only because it derives from the divine source that the holy people of the world the champions of supernal ethics the lions of justice and truth the kings of faith and simple heartedness the rulers of life and conquerors of death who ride the heights of existence with their intellect and feeling with a mighty spirit that is the holy of holies which peals before them like a bell in the thunder of their might that transcends all boundaries of time and place free themselves and the entire world together with them from narrow obligations and constrained boundaries
2404882 when you look outside what do you see the market wagons horses people all running in different directions fifty years from now this market will be completely different there will be different horses and wagons different merchandise and different people i will no longer be here and you will no longer be here so let me ask you as you stand here now how can you be so busy and preoccupied that you dont even have time to look up at the sky
2404883 there is nothing else to do and no where else you have to go
2404884 originally people would come to me with their problems and sometimes i would feel nothing at all but i would beg g d that i should be able to feel their pain eventually i reached the point that i would feel more pain than the person themself who had come sometimes a person may be successful at distracting themself from and forgetting their own suffering and pain but i feel it completely
2404885 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil
2404886 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil
2404887 i had an affair and the answer to the question as to whether the child is mine or not is none of your business that is between me and the childs mother
2404888 its important because i want people to know that im not the best because im sanya richards
2404889 im the best because of god i truly believe we cant will ourselves to win i hope people see the same thing i see
2404890 so long as you practice your religious belief in conformity with the constitution and the laws there will be no problem
2404891 the practice of religion should be within the laws the chinese government is against conducting other activities in the name of religion
2404892 there are very specific provisions on how an athlete should practice his religion or beliefs during the games
2404893 as an athlete he or she should follow that charter thats their guideline
2404894 is designed to provide a more complete understanding of the role as an ambassador of the country as an olympic athlete
2404895 frankly its none of our business we as an olympic committee never do anything to impede an athletes freedom from expressing faith
2404896 its important because i want people to know that im not the best because im sanya richards
2404897 im the best because of god i truly believe we cant will ourselves to win i hope people see the same thing i see
2404898 so long as you practice your religious belief in conformity with the constitution and the laws there will be no problem
2404899 the practice of religion should be within the laws the chinese government is against conducting other activities in the name of religion
2404900 there are very specific provisions on how an athlete should practice his religion or beliefs during the games
2404901 as an athlete he or she should follow that charter thats their guideline
2404902 is designed to provide a more complete understanding of the role as an ambassador of the country as an olympic athlete
2404903 sometimes western christians dont understand the freedom thats within china so i could imagine people arriving in beijing with two huge suitcases full of bibles thinking its a good thing
2404904 but what you want in china is legally printed bibles
2404905 has the capability to meet whatever needs are in china
2404906 if youre a christian you see it is a wonderful foundational base in china for the things god wants to do
2404907 sometimes western christians dont understand the freedom thats within china so i could imagine people arriving in beijing with two huge suitcases full of bibles thinking its a good thing
2404908 but what you want in china is legally printed bibles
2404909 has the capability to meet whatever needs are in china
2404910 its because you arent working enough with your breath you have to breath fully and deeply as you work and then it will feel more gentle to him
2404911 i am aware that this is an important issue in general but how can i practically make that separation when i come to class i really tried to do it this time
2404912 a brief argument between vice president cheney and a senior democratic senator led cheney to utter a big time obscenity on the senate floor this week
2404913 on tuesday cheney serving in his role as president of the senate appeared in the chamber for a photo session
2404914 leahys spokesman david carle yesterday confirmed the brief but fierce exchange
2404915 the vice president seemed to be taking personally the criticism that senator leahy and others have leveled against halliburtons sole source contracts in iraq
2404916 among the reasons for this conclusion are the licensee s repeated allowance of minors within the licensed premises and the licensee s failure to keep and maintain a log book all in accordance with the joliet liquor code
2404917 all persons under the age of 21 to enter and remain upon the licensed premises during the evening hours of august 6 2008
2404918 until a road is exposed to the elements there s a lot of oil and tar on it which makes it more difficult to pick up a tire mark though not impossible
2404919 this is an active investigation we are interviewing the victim s friends and the witnesses who came upon the crash site after the fact
2404920 he wasnt supposed to die others have endured much worse beatings and survived
2404921 beware new 9 11 are eager to construct or accept absurd conspiracy theories about it but i dont think they really believe in these theories so i dont think arguments would help against such hypocritical fantasies
2404922 bin laden admitted it i mean we all saw him on aljazeera
2404923 well it could have been like this i dont believe it but its difficult to disprove and it doesnt matter to me because those suicide hijackers were the key element to the plot without them there would be no 9 11 no matter how much cia or an investor would want it
2404924 but it seems strange to me that he managed to write his full name yet failed to scribble 40 xs into boxes
2404925 columnist dahlia lithwick gingerly attempts to chide u s government figures who rationalized torturing terrorist suspects because a fictional character named jack bauer did it in a tv melodrama called
2404926 diane beaver the staff judge advocate general who gave legal approval to 18 controversial interrogation techniques including waterboarding sexual humiliation and terrorizing prisoners with dogs told british legal expert philippe sands that bauer gave people lots of ideas
2404927 john yoo the former justice department lawyer who produced the so called torture memos simultaneously redefining both the laws of torture and of logic cites bauer in his book
2404928 jack bauer would have known inside of 10 minutes he was not a ticking time bomb
2404929 jack bauer saved los angeles he saved hundreds of thousands of lives are you going to convict jack bauer
2404930 in the following days as the horror started to be airbrushed no more bodies plummeting to the sidewalk the anthrax letters started to come some to people i knew and i thought no im not going to sit here passively and wait for it to happen i wanted to go to them whoever they were grab them by the neck and get them before they could get us
2404931 a chemical attack would be horrible but it would be finite
2404932 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2404933 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2404934 its a dramatic fall for the former vice presidential candidate who was widely seen as a potential cabinet member in the future or even a running mate for barack obama
2404935 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them
2404936 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2404937 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2404938 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2404939 its more disappointing but again my biggest concerns the family right now
2404940 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2404941 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2404942 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2404943 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2404944 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2404945 for someone to believe in evolution solely they must believe that there is no god or that everything happened by pure chance and we are the product of natural selection for which we should be very proud of in that case
2404946 because evolution fails to account for how the universe came into existence
2404947 evolution is incompatible with the idea of god because evolution seemingly denies any involvement by god in how things come into existence
2404948 i think you pointed out your own problem when you used the word seemingly
2404949 again because evolution is incomplete whereas i believe the christian account of creation and the existence of god account for any questions we have about the origin of life or the origins of what see around us
2404950 evolution contradicts the quote from the bible because it teaches that we evolved from another creature which evolved from another creature and that we are here not by design but by natural selection from what i can tell on both sides of the issue they are incompatible
2404951 he created me in eternity before time began and i will exist for all eternity to come
2404952 the lot is cast into the lap but its every decision is from the lord
2404953 i do realize that evolution in its entirety is just a theory
2404954 natural selection leaves everything unto chance whereas in the bible we see that god designed designs everything including humans chance cannot be compatible with design
2404955 the lot is cast into the lap but its every decision is from the lord
2404956 what would the texts have meant to the original hebrew audience
2404957 there are certain areas over which god has freely chosen not to have control and there are certain things within the physical universe which are simply not possible to know
2404958 the inherent indeterminacy of the universe is contingent upon god having chose to create it that way
2404959 love is supremely manifest in self limiting costly action on behalf of the good and existence of another
2404960 without such information an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2404961 irans decision to disperse and keep secret several of its key sites further hinders the development of a full picture of its centrifuge complex
2404962 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2404963 an emphasis on military responses to this conflict has the effect of discouraging iran from allowing more effective iaea inspections something necessary for the successful conclusion of a diplomatic solution to irans nuclear program
2404964 iran is understandably concerned that more transparency on its part could lead to the u s and israeli militaries gaining better targeting information on its nuclear program
2404965 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
2404966 could prompt iran to hasten its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons by embarking on a crash program
2404967 iran could then build a small centrifuge plant at a secret location capable of producing weapons grade uranium for one or two nuclear weapons per year
2404968 im the running back they give me the ball and i go
2404969 were all trying to serve as solid witnesses and role models of christ by showing these kids what it means to be a positive influence
2404970 weve been sold on upward and what it offers kids and families for a while
2404971 we also wanted to find something that was fun but didnt compete with anything else around
2404972 besides this is football usa so it just made sense
2404973 now that might sound weird but the bible says it was his blood that made us all clean and freed us of sin
2404974 im the running back they give me the ball and i go
2404975 were all trying to serve as solid witnesses and role models of christ by showing these kids what it means to be a positive influence
2404976 weve been sold on upward and what it offers kids and families for a while
2404977 we also wanted to find something that was fun but didnt compete with anything else around
2404978 besides this is football usa so it just made sense
2404979 now that might sound weird but the bible says it was his blood that made us all clean and freed us of sin
2404980 weve taken a number of different angles with her as the anchor of the evening news and the ratings still in the toilet and her contracts air tight so even if we replaced her wed still have to pay her un godly sums of money the only option is to try something radical how about we send her to iraq and not one of these deals like the other networks have pulled where they secretly send someone to iraq and film them and then they come back and report on all that they have seen no no we send her to iraq and do a media push about it leading up that way susie homemaker from bumble fuck iowa can write in to the network and ask questions and tell katie what to do over there and she does it from fucking iraq either ratings go up or she gets blown up by insurgents and therefore breaks her contract or both total win win

2404982 theres a chapel in every dorm and everyone comes together and takes some role in the masses

2404989 the only changes that are meaningful are the ones from within and they certainly have done that
2404990 theyve done a lot of housekeeping that place was starting to look pretty rough
2404991 what the people who own units here were looking for is improvement in and delivery of services
2404992 we dont have 400 problems here we have 400 different kind of problems
2404993 im really proud of the people in there for what theyve done its difficult to take a mess and clean it up
2404994 prior to this students had to drive down randall road to college green drive and then wind back around campus

2404998 at some airlines these days if you want a glass of water you have to pay for it theyre that strapped
2404999 so how willing are airlines to put up the money for ohare theyre not willing at all
2405000 they dont have a prayer of getting this done by 2014
2405001 its way too costly and nobodys going to be foolish enough to pay for it
2405002 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2405003 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2405004 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971 we havent increased our infrastructure as other airports have continued to add runways
2405005 chicago doesnt have the most stellar record in doing things in the most cost effective way
2405006 so the realities are that airlines are saying we dont necessarily mind paying for improvements but we dont want to pay for a boondoggle and we dont want to pay for a lot of political cumshaw
2405007 making ohare more efficient is an incredibly important move for aviation infrastructure
2405008 its a challenge for chicago to finish ohare but they have to press ahead they have to be successful
2405009 pretty explit so if you dont want to hear what a real man thinks just click back

2405018 it started as i was preparing to leave i thought my cab had arrived but it wasnt my cab so i sat back down on a bench and as i sat down another person sat next to me i told her i had thought my cab was coming i dont know why i told her that it felt like instinct i felt obligated
2405019 well i frighten people i didnt want to frighten her she seemed fragile she was unmarried
2405020 she was eating a small piece of fried fish i glanced at her fingers
2405021 well i had said i thought i saw my cab and laughed briefly then said you know he probably pulled around back hoping i thought to get a snicker but she didnt laugh

2405038 if one were to adhere to historical accuracy all the way youd probably have the most boring two hours on earth but firstly its entertainment and weve taken license with history to make it more compelling
2405039 its a good thing that historians are going to harangue this and say its not accurate good itll make somebody pick up a book
2405040 so i have figured out that all girls are crazy and the secret is that you just pick the one you like the best and stick with her

2405052 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2405053 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2405054 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2405055 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job

2405067 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2405068 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of dissidents and human rights activists and religious leaders
2405069 i think whats really important is not to mix politics with the olympic games
2405070 i know what hes going through i feel sorry for him
2405071 you have to pull your children out of school your wife has to fit in its very difficult it tears families apart
2405072 ive never met him id like to i admire what hes done
2405073 theres a lot of clubs that need his kind of leadership and let me tell you he will bring something to those new york jets that they havent had since joe namath
2405074 wellington mara said hey guys i just want you to know one thing i completed a deal this afternoon for y
2405075 and its the damnedest game i ever played its a preseason game but you still have to go out and perform he had all night to throw the ball
2405076 let me tell you our defense welcomed him with open arms
2405077 just like brett favre is a great quarterback tittle was a great quarterback he had a lot of football left in him
2405078 he became the hit in new york wherever y a tittle went people recognized his bald head he looked like he was 65 years old he was the hit of broadway he was another frank gifford in recognition in new york they recognized me as the defensive star but offensively it was frank gifford and y a tittle
2405079 he said he would never trade me after he got rid of rosie greer and dick modzelewski
2405080 i was part of new york it seemed like and i had been on the cover of time magazine and i used to do a monday night sports show with howard cosell and my family was there we lived there i knew my way around
2405081 it was just earthshaking im telling you it broke my heart
2405082 i said i know who caused this and i tell you i will never quit until you fire him
2405083 they say every year they want to have more games on campus
2405084 i am honored to represent my country and im so happy to be an american and to live there
2405085 why cant this guy just dump it off and take the 5 yards
2405086 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2405087 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2405088 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2405089 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2405090 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2405091 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2405092 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2405093 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2405094 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2405095 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2405096 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2405097 the drunken shenanigans perpetrated in your youth may long since have been eclipsed by an adult life of sober responsibility and charitable works but on the web none of that really counts and so far as the viewer is concerned they might as well have happened yesterday
2405098 there is a sinus congestion in these places i would take tylenol if i were you
2405099 you got two choices you stay home and not vote or if you want your vote to mean something and you want to be with the winner you vote for one of the two major party candidates otherwise you are wasting your vote
2405100 were those voters in the 19th century who spun off from the whigs and the democrats and didnt try to spin the difference between these two parties on slavery waste their vote
2405101 ive done surveys and polls all over the country heres my conclusion 15 of the republicans will vote for the republican nominee if the republican nominee was leon trotsky and 15 of the democrats would vote for the democratic nominee if the nominee was ayn rand
2405102 they didnt roll back any of president bushs legislation when they took over in 2007
2405103 its exactly what karl rove wants us to do is to initiate impeachment
2405104 i think i got to go to the airport so i can get home
2405105 better to vote for someone you believe in and lose than someone you dont believe in and win
2405106 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2405107 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2405108 so they had a hearing late at night robin was put into jail and since that point he has been held here in colarado springs in the criminal justice center in el paso county basically just a regular old county jail with all kinds of people dangerous criminals many of them and its a difficult place to be but robins in good spirits and were now dealing with the consequences of his action in the military courts here
2405109 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2405110 if i tell the iraqi police or the sons of iraq they will tell the wrong people and i will be killed i dont trust them if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found about the grenades
2405111 when the sois sons of iraq stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2405112 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire costs of that program
2405113 the u s military was supposed to be out of the employment business by now when it introduced the sons of iraq initiative last year senior commanders expected the local security personnel to be hired gradually into the ranks of the iraqi army and police but iraqs shiite dominated central government has balked at the idea of bringing so many young sunni men including many onetime militants into the countrys fledging security forces less than 20 of the roughly 103 000 sons of iraq had been given government jobs as of early june that has left u s forces responsible for employing and paying the iraqis

2405115 i believe i have something okay we continue to urge the council of representatives to seek a compromise that can be adopted promptly we regret that the iraqi parliament adjourned yesterday without finishing its work on a local elections law the parliamentarians have made great strides towards finishing the closing agreement on most of the more difficult issues we recognize that the election law brought to the floor important questions regarding the status of kirkuk the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the eleciton law the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2405116 my understanding is that theyre continuing i dont have anything particular to say about the process right now we havent discussed those publicly before im not going to here as we said well provide you with details when we get through with this
2405117 i would not be prepared to provide a timeline for that
2405118 shiite militia leader muqtada al sadr stepped back into iraqs political fray friday with an offer that if genuine washington would be hard pressed to refuse set a timetable for withdrawal of u s troops from iraq and the mahdi army will begin to disband the main reason for the armed resistance is the american miltiary presence said sadr emissary salah al ubaidi who spoke to reporters in najaf friday if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2405119 was one of the main reasons that violence in iraq has dropped to the lowest levels in four years for both civilians and trooops
2405120 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2405121 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2405122 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2405123 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2405124 come on we can have a better country we can change this around
2405125 well if i were president the home morgate crisis wouldnt have happened and the oil prices wouldnt be what they are
2405126 dont vote for eugene debbs youre throwing your vote away

2405156 for the first round of 2006 philippine it association draft accenture selects jonathan tan
2405157 please browse around and feel free to contribute anything for about or pertaining to candice amp matt
2405158 we are excited to add dwight jones to our football team
2405159 our football staff and compliance office have worked very hard to make his enrollment a possibility and his teammates and i look forward to welcoming dwight to chapel hill the people at valdosta state have been extremely cooperative throughout this situation and we are very appreciative of their efforts and understanding
2405160 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there
2405161 we have lost three of the most dedicated stalwart pillars of this community
2405162 a lady that lives north of town reported that she had heard a thump
2405163 we believe they tried to make an emergency landing in a farmers field
2405164 a comment that was made to me was that the impact upon this community is probably comparable in its enormity to the crandall canyon mine disaster up north with affected several communities
2405165 its a very tragic hard thing for our community and were grieving down here very much
2405166 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
2405167 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says f u to me that kind of bothers me or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me the boos they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the f u and the little kids saying swear words to me i dont understand that
2405168 the uk does remain subject to high levels of covert non military activity by foreign intelligence organisations
2405169 they are increasingly combining traditional intelligence methods with new and sophisticated technical attacks for example attempting to penetrate computer networks through the internet
2405170 it systems in government departments and various organisations including elements of the national infrastructure have been and continue to be attacked to obtain the sensitive information they hold
2405171 some of these attacks are well planned and well executed
2405172 its a little odd to play against a group of individuals that ive been so close to for so long its like playing in the backyard with your family so its different that way
2405173 but you know you got to separate and move on
2405174 thats what its all about having fun the guy thats pitching over there is a great friend of mine
2405175 hes been a good player his whole career he had a good day today i didnt notice anything and nobody said anything to me about it
2405176 if you look around everybody gets excited when they do great thats just the way the game is today
2405177 thats why we call it a team at some point in the season all 25 count
2405178 i know what my job is i just got to stay ready when they need me
2405179 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2405180 we feel community colleges are a vital part of oregons educational system and economy
2405181 frequently the opportunity to attend a community college is the pathway to a living wage and a secure family however attendance at these colleges is a financial challenge for many students
2405182 the miller foundation has given each college and its community a tremendous challenge and opportunity
2405183 on top of its recent grant of 250 000 for our jerome campus renovation project the miller foundation has proven to be a generous friend of oregons community college students
2405184 it means that for every new scholarship dollar an individual or business in our community contributes to help our students miller foundation will match it with a scholarship donation of its own effectively doubling a local donors impact on student opportunity
2405185 we have some nice players and have some guys ready to step up and play much bigger roles this season but green hope returns almost everyone
2405186 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2405187 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2405188 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2405189 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2405190 it would be a great ending to end on a high note with a gold
2405191 when i first turned pro i thought i would do 10 years and that would be an awesome career
2405192 and here i am 15 years later i never imagined going that long no way
2405193 like wow five olympics are you serious thats a massive span for anyone let alone a cyclist
2405194 we are happy to share with the world in these joyful moments but i am sad to see the big teams of many countries while our country is left behind with one of the smallest teams in the olympics
2405195 i think we just lapsed for 10 15 minutes and we should stay focused for 90 minutes
2405196 all together we create a lot of chances but we just cant finish if we stay focused we can beat anybody in this league if we dont somethings going to happen to us
2405197 two shots in the first half and to be down a goal is tough especially with our mind set
2405198 on monday well start all over again mathematically were not out of it were not going to quit not matter what
2405199 feeling healthy prepared and excited hopefully i can make my way to the top of the podium
2405200 some of the best training of my life since i have had such a great training camp my nerves have not bothered me at all i plan on getting a little more nervous as the race gets closer but nothing to this point
2405201 i think for mark the exciting thing is that he has a gold medal in his pocket already from that relay in athens so hes going to shoot for the stars hes directing all of his strategy toward winning the event
2405202 i am planning on relaxing a hair for my first swim if i have that luxury
2405203 if i need to go all out i will but if i am in good position then i will back off
2405204 what can i say i havent got the focus this week obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2405205 i think i need to spend 24 hours in bed
2405206 ive been fighting with my swing ive got the double miss going missing left and right i really need to figure out what im going to do with my long game
2405207 i tossed my club at the bag on the par 3 13th and it must have just caught the plastic part because it dented the shaft
2405208 i didnt three putt a single green with the hybrid and that was after five three putts with the regular one
2405209 i might bend my putter to an 18 degree loft tonight maybe thats the way to putt these greens
2405210 i dont know if its just my personality or my game
2405211 obviously i havent had success at augusta but the u s open british open and this one i feel suit my game quite well
2405212 ive heard a lot of comments this week from anywhere to hes wearing a lions jersey so theres no way he can win because of the luck of the lions
2405213 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2405214 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2405215 rookies are fine and dandy and im glad to see them progressing but i dont fall in love with rookies
2405216 it aint the best there were some missed tackles there were some third down conversions there was some rushing yardage there was getting pushed around there were some snaps where we had people dogtrotting we did some things we werent very proud of
2405217 we were glad to win the ballgame but by no stretch of the imagination was that a work of art their backups just played a little bit worse than our backups
2405218 we will get to see guys under the big lights
2405219 we will get to see guys we havent seen at this level in an nfl exhibition game its probably as fast as any game they will ever play so we get to see the young guys in that situation
2405220 im looking to try to get back in a game situation
2405221 putting on a game jersey and getting back into the flow of things seeing a lot of different coverages a lot of things that we havent seen yet so far in camp and a lot of different looks that we have to get used to in the regular season
2405222 weve got some stuff we want to take the next step toward
2405223 were not going to reinvent the offense in a week but we are going to take some steps
2405224 you go out there and run as hard as you can in practice qualifying and the race and see what youve got whether you win or run out of gas and finish 36th it doesnt matter at this point
2405225 second through 36th dont really matter but a win would be nice
2405226 we are excited about the way the year has been going its been a pretty phenomenal season for us
2405227 weve also had a couple of bad runs hopefully we can just keep it going in the right direction and try to get everything we can possible for the chase
2405228 we definitely have plans to go back multiple times to get it right
2405229 actually we started the discussions about wider tires last year a little bit more so in the spring we talked about wider tires we talked about taller tires wheel diameters and things of that nature
2405230 weve been kicking around and goodyear has been doing research on it already
2405231 im a big part of what goes on at dei when we have a bad day or bad week or go down the wrong road i take responsibility for that too
2405232 i know we need to get better i know what we did last year and i know what were capable of
2405233 its a lot of pressure a lot of people look to you for answers all the time i like a good challenge im accepting the challenge and i think we can do great things together
2405234 its just showing our appreciation for them because theyre the unsung heroes of our sport
2405235 el lunes pagu tres libras y media por una ca a ahora de repente son tres con noventa no me lo puedo creer me he quejado con los responsables porque tienen dos precios uno para la gente que viene regularmente y otro para la que no
2405236 no hay una lista de precios no me importa pagar m s pero es totalmente arbitrario no es por el dinero sino por el timo es escandaloso
2405237 sorry jonas brothers id love to hear you preform but i gotta take a shit instead
2405238 weve seen professional entertainers with lions tigers primates and bears
2405239 we are very fortunate because neighboring animal hospitals refer the animals they dont see to us
2405240 usually ill make an on site visit to inspect the fish and take a water samples
2405241 i will put a couple of them into smaller bowls full of anesthetic water to inspect them closer
2405242 surgery involves a table with a tank full of anesthetic water topped with foam pad cut into a v shape
2405243 you set the fish into the v run a tube full of anesthetic water from the tank over the fishs gills so it can breath
2405244 to wake up the coy you put them in a bowl of clean water
2405245 walking in here you will see a little bit of everything
2405246 patients tell us they dont mind the wait because they are anxious to see what walks through our doors next
2405247 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2405248 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2405249 eu gostaria de ter uma ditadura como a de juan per n quando ele desaparecia com voc voc ficava desaparecido para sempre
2405250 you cant kill anyone with a meat cleaver go get a hammer
2405251 part of it is the way we see ourselves but its also how other people see us
2405252 historically weve been denied our manhood so we really want to cling to it as soon as boys are able to walk we call them little man anything that threatens that manhood we dont want
2405253 we know that the rate of suicide is going up in the black community
2405254 and studies show that one of the ways depression manifests itself is through aggression
2405255 if you feel like your life is not worth much then the lives of other people arent worth much either and you behave in a way thats not responsible
2405256 im not saying that depression robs you of discerning right and wrong
2405257 im saying if youre looking for causes dont overlook depression
2405258 the arbitrator emphasized that he found a contradiction as to who initiated the sexual encounter which could not be resolved because the patient did not testify
2405259 as the applicable regulations make plain and as should be immediately obvious the question of who initiated the encounter has no bearing at all on whether baldwin violated the regulations

2405265 now you have right in the heart of coal country the beginning of the solar century
2405266 it couldnt happen at a better time it couldnt be a bigger vote of confidence for pennsylvanias alternative energy policies
2405267 to think that were still sitting on probably 300 to 500 years of coal reserves it just shows that were trying to be innovative
2405268 the legacy of coal was one that when they left they left the scarred landscape behind as well
2405269 it was difficult to get anybody to take a second look at carbon county
2405270 the reality is we are putting the nuts and bolts together on the states entire energy package but that will come to fruition

2405274 well you know how it goes with me i got lost several times but i did find the place
2405275 maybe probably nothing more than we could get at the other store

2405280 im going to shoulder this remorse and guilt for the rest of my life
2405281 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all

2405312 one of the features i truly appreciate about these locks is the ability to create unique codes for individuals who have access to our home
2405313 professional grade security features include a warning signal after 4 incorrect attempts the keypad will also stop working for 30 seconds which can be a deterrent to would be burglars
2405314 the keypad is simple enough for even small children to operate

2405321 and it was a great place to buy wedding gifts

2405334 from 635 million years ago the outcome is preserved in the geologic record we see that strong forcing on the climate not unlike the current carbon dioxide forcing results in change of climate to a completely different state
2405335 the previous shift triggered events that resulted in global warming and an ending of the last snowball ice age
2405336 we dont know we dont know we dont know we dont know

2405342 i much prefer the idea of a lots of nukes and b using the electricity from said nukes to power fischer tropsch synthesis of methane from atmospheric co2 plus water thats actually carbon neutral and were already geared up to ship methane around in pipelines you can run automobiles off it too with a conversion kit or throw more energy at it to polymerize it all the way into long chain alkanes and burn them like diesel as the carbon this fuel emits is stuff that came out of the atmospheric carbon cycle rather than the fossil carbon reserves its a big win over using coal or tar sands and it leaves the farmland free for growing food for humans
2405343 why do you think converting solar energy to fuel using electrical generation fischer tropsch would be any more efficient than using biofuels which we already know are far too land hungry to replace fossil oil
2405344 might have to reduce corn subsidies and sugar tariffs in order to import brazilian ethanol instead

2405351 i am truly honored that the supreme court had the confidence in me to name me to this prestigious post
2405352 i look forward to the challenges in serving the people of illinois as one of its appellate judges
2405353 mary is a hard working judge whose love of the law is exceeded only by her willingness to study it
2405354 she will apply a steady hand to cases presented for her review
2405355 even during my days as a practicing attorney i wanted to be a member of a reviewing court
2405356 i worked hard and studied hard and todays announcement is really a dream come true
2405357 i could not think of a better candidate for the post
2405358 mary has experience as a trial attorney and a trial judge and we need people on the appellate court who have spent time in the trenches and know what we go through on a day to day basis
2405359 im so happy and thankful that the cd was well received by the public
2405360 people keep telling me how much they love my version of the hit single harem scarems honestly may kanya kanya rin silang favorites like the search is over by survivor thats what love is for ni amy grant when you love someone by bryan adams and cant cry hard enough by the williams brothers ngayon available na all the songs on dvd and they cannot just listen but also watch me sing them i really want to thank all the people who worked with me in the album nino regalado as arranger drummer and musical director of all the songs noel mendez on first guitar janno queyquep on second guitar monet silvestre and jay agustin sa keyboards so mina on bass and the opera sa backup vocals
2405361 i thought it was a brilliant promotion at the time
2405362 i didnt anticipate any type of feedback it was just a party thing
2405363 marches and accused any white person in the town of being kkk then demanded the resignation of every white public official
2405364 warm to the touch with smoke emanating from the pipe
2405365 i definitely think that the states attorney the judges and even the officers i think they have had unfair practices
2405366 thats a shame you know creating problems for elderly persons just is not good under any circumstance
2405367 of course that also ties into the racial aspect because our society is such that minorities dont become elderly the way white people do they die first
2405368 there are inequities in health care there are a variety of inequities in this country and so anything that disproportionately impacts the elderly has the opposite impact on minorities just the math is such as that
2405369 but i think the audience really likes all the high energy in the third movement
2405370 the only changes that are meaningful are the ones from within and they certainly have done that
2405371 theyve done a lot of housekeeping that place was starting to look pretty rough
2405372 what the people who own units here were looking for is improvement in and delivery of services
2405373 we dont have 400 problems here we have 400 different kind of problems
2405374 im really proud of the people in there for what theyve done its difficult to take a mess and clean it up

2405382 im having a tough time right now but ill battle through it just like anybody else
2405383 im just going to grind out and keep trying to make my pitches you cant really stress about it and try harder because it will just get worse
2405384 prior to this students had to drive down randall road to college green drive and then wind back around campus

2405387 of the 50 years weve been married shes dealt with ecc for most of them
2405388 its hard to see anything that would have impacted all of those populations and made them all decrease frequency other than the increase in the population
2405389 a just society allows individuals to exercise their autonomy and to fulfill themselves
2405390 to provide a forum for dialogue on the philosophical issues raised by the womens liberation movement

2405397 we have to let the people know that they are at risk of being detained
2405398 cbp strives to treat all travelers with respect and in a professional manner while maintaining the focus of our mission which is to protect all citizens and visitors in the united states
2405399 anyone in the u s unlawfully should not be surprised if they are encountered or arrested to be placed in removal proceedings
2405400 its not a question of whether its right or wrong its the law
2405401 they federal agents seem to be desperate to capture people to prove that they are enforcing the law they are going to go to any extreme
2405402 authorities may seek to identify and verify their legal stay in this country
2405403 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2405404 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2405405 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2405406 mayor kilpatrick thanked his team for their continued commitment and focus on moving the city of detroit forward
2405407 he told the staff he plans to continue his work on moving an aggressive agenda forward for the city of detroit
2405408 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2405409 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2405410 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2405411 at some airlines these days if you want a glass of water you have to pay for it theyre that strapped
2405412 so how willing are airlines to put up the money for ohare theyre not willing at all
2405413 they dont have a prayer of getting this done by 2014
2405414 its way too costly and nobodys going to be foolish enough to pay for it
2405415 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2405416 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2405417 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971 we havent increased our infrastructure as other airports have continued to add runways
2405418 chicago doesnt have the most stellar record in doing things in the most cost effective way
2405419 so the realities are that airlines are saying we dont necessarily mind paying for improvements but we dont want to pay for a boondoggle and we dont want to pay for a lot of political cumshaw
2405420 making ohare more efficient is an incredibly important move for aviation infrastructure
2405421 its a challenge for chicago to finish ohare but they have to press ahead they have to be successful
2405422 its a lot better than three ninety eight or four oh two
2405423 a lot better than it has been recently and its definitely good to notice that its going down
2405424 i know its a lot nicer for me and my friends who have to pay for our gas everyone is a lot happier that its going down and hopefully it continues
2405425 we watch where we go and if we can car pool we do that so its still pretty hard
2405426 she couldnt really get in the water at all because her skin had a lot of open sores on it and she would scratch so much
2405427 anytime any of her skin was exposed she would start scratching
2405428 the most practical way to treat eczema is to create a barrier between your skin and the environment
2405429 its a lot of steps to still have to do
2405430 but its allowed her to have a quality of life

2405433 and its to give recognition to our veterans programs at our post
2405434 its supposed to be a beautiful sunday so we should have a good crowd
2405435 we just appreciate any money we can get to help the different causes of the veterans
2405436 its exciting to see the ladies auxiliary and mens auxiliary get together and support our veterans
2405437 we do a lot for our veterans and anyone in our community who needs our help
2405438 its been a drain on the staff its been just a long time coming

2405446 i was there from a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2405447 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2405448 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2405449 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2405450 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2405451 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2405452 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2405453 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2405454 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2405455 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2405456 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2405457 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention
2405458 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2405459 i think furious would be a good way to describe it

2405476 i really think this is a message the community should hear

2405479 ive never seen anyone using the arbortheater i thought it would be cool how do we make that happen
2405480 i wanted to make sure i could be there and perform without causing any trouble
2405481 this is how you get things done you do your homework and do a good presentation
2405482 its a beautiful piece of theater and it sends a strong message
2405483 who knows it could be the start of summer theater at the arbortheater

2405489 the consensus of the board was that they would not be in favor of mining the property
2405490 the board will take formal action that will remove mining of the property from future consideration and will also not do any research regarding this issue
2405491 when we talked about doing the tests it was never my intention to mine the property
2405492 in my mind it was never going to go any further than the tests we were going to do
2405493 the current nature of the discussion is preliminary and any change in the use of the property is not imminent
2405494 the property may remain a golf course indefinitely and no changes will be implemented prior to the 2011 season
2405495 as rounds have decreased and inflationary expenses increased the park district has had to consider subsidizing golf operations during the past several years

2405509 the common complaint that readers dont like staring at a screen for hours on end doesnt hold water we actually spend a lot of our time staring at computer screens pdas and tiny little displays on mobile phones

2405522 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2405523 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2405524 only one of us could make it over the wall
2405525 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2405526 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2405527 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2405528 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2405529 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2405530 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2405531 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2405532 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2405533 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2405534 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2405535 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2405536 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2405537 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2405538 i should have known that people would feel that way
2405539 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2405540 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2405541 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2405542 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2405543 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2405544 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2405545 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2405546 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2405547 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2405548 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2405549 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2405550 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids

2405553 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
2405554 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2405555 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2405556 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2405557 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2405558 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2405559 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2405560 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2405561 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2405562 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2405563 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2405564 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2405565 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2405566 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2405567 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live

2405575 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2405576 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2405577 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2405578 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2405579 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby

2405583 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2405584 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2405585 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2405586 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2405587 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2405588 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career

2405614 a friend is one who knows all about you and likes you anyway
2405615 however rare true love may be it is less so than true friendship
2405616 the only way to have a friend is to be one
2405617 real friendship is shown in times of trouble prosperity is full of friends
2405618 no man can be happy without a friend nor be sure of his friend till he is
2405619 dont believe your friends when they ask you to be honest with them all they really want is to be maintained in the good opinion they have of themselves
2405620 when you die if youve got five real friends youve had a great life
2405621 true love is like a ghost everyone talks of it few have seen it
2405622 love is like a rhino short sighted but always willing to find a way
2405623 love you know seeks to make happy rather than to be happy
2405624 those who love deeply never grown old they may die of old age but they die young
2405625 there is always some madness in love but there is also always some reason in madness
2405626 the best feelings are those that have no words to describe them
2405627 you come to love not by finding the perfect person but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly
2405628 the only fool bigger than the person who knows it all is the person who argues with him
2405629 the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their right names
2405630 my opinions may have changed but not the fact that im right
2405631 deal with the faults of others as gently as with your own
2405632 i will not condemn you for what you did yesterday if you do it right today
2405633 we know what a person thinks not when he tells us what he thinks but by his actions

2405661 the white house had concocted a fake letter from iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
2405662 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohamed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
2405663 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort

2405678 i deplore the sponsored activities that are only aimed at dividing the communists in several fronts
2405679 those who have had the clandestine links with the foreign power centres and have remained in power through the foreign blessing have been trying to malign my nationalistic credentials by labelling me as being close to a certain foreign power centre and of being against the left unity

2405710 my position on hamas is indistinguishable from the position of hillary clinton and john mccain
2405711 they operate not by arguing but by slandering vilifying demonising they very promptly wheel out anti semitism there is an element of paranoia in this inclination to view any serious attempt at a compromised peace as somehow directed against israel

2405713 the us has more than 12 000 nuclear weapons the former soviet union has about the same britain and france have several hundred and israel has 150 or more

2405727 broadly each minister is responsible for 1 his private conduct 2 the general conduct of his department and 3 acts done or left undone by officials in his department
2405728 if there are doubts or suspicions over my behaviour the situation must be fully clarified and therefore i must take responsibility as a citizen
2405729 in view of the way i have always conducted myself in political life i think it is impossible to hold public office at my level under any type of suspicion
2405730 the general conduct of his department and for acts done or left undone by his department
2405731 the principle of ministerial responsibility as seen in mature democracies is either weak or missing in myanmar the principle means that the minister accepts responsibility for any lapses or irregularities within his ministry and resigns from the office
2405732 despite reports of numerous irregularities in various agencies at different levels misappropriation of funds by individuals and groups and increasing volume of complaints received from the public on the quality of services and responsiveness rarely has a minister chosen to accept responsibility for such irregularities
2405733 not only rebuffed calls for him to step down he practically took no responsibility for the defective projects and other anomalies and has had no problem retaining his ministerial office
2405734 finally after what was a prolonged episode that almost cost him his job the cabinet found that he took it upon himself more than he should have shouldered the cabinet session of 20th october 2004 chaired by deputy prime minister datuk sri mohd najib tun abdul razak discussed at length the background of this public outcry datuk seri samy vellus extensive reports to the session were noted by the cabinet with the view that the minister ought not to take it upon himself all the blame hurled by the public as there were various parties that were responsible like consultants contractors engineers architects etc
2405735 it takes years to rid a public servant who misbehaves or who does not perform and by the sheer procedural rigmarole it involves bosses are quite reluctant to effect the actual brunt of the general orders it is instructive to know lacking in acumen and productivity are not listed as grounds for dismissal neither is the inability to achieve results put in as a factor to dismiss or suspend
2405736 i as minister must accept full responsibility to parliament for any mistakes and inefficiency of officials in my department just as when my officials bring off any successes on my behalf i take full credit for them
2405737 any departure from this long established rule is bound to bring the civil service right into the political arena and that we should all on both sides of the house deprecate most vigorously
2405738 it is an insult to ministers of all governments of whatever colour or complexion to suggest that officials carry responsibility for policy decisions ministers do so and that strikes at the very heart of our parliamentary system
2405739 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2405740 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2405741 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2405742 what russia is doing in georgia is open undisguised aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2405743 it is i who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth
2405744 i will deliver you from their bondage and i will redeem you with an outstretched arm
2405745 oh come little saviour come and redeem us by thy outstretched arm
2405746 into your hands father of mercies we commend our brother andrew in the sure and certain hope that together with all who have died in christ he will rise with him on the last day merciful lord turn toward us and listen to our prayers open the gates of paradise to your servant and help us who remain to comfort one another with assurance of faith until we all meet in christ and are with you and with our brother forever we ask this through christ our lord amen
2405747 we are planning a future after his release we know he is going to be released soon we are going to be married under french law in france
2405748 i am mature enough to decide for myself age does not make a difference
2405749 either because they have too much feeling and cannot control themselves or they have no feelings
2405750 since my release in 1997 from india there is no international warrant pending against me from interpol anywhere
2405751 in 1997 the french embassy in kathmandu enquired in writing with the government of nepal whether there was a case pending against me here as stated by some newspapers at that time and the nepal government never replied to that enquiry from the embassy
2405752 had there been a case pending against me here certainly nepal would have succeeded in having an international arrest of warrant issued against me
2405753 my daughter is an adult and whatever decision she makes i will be happy
2405754 we have restricted such acts inside the jail but we have allowed nihita to bring food for him

2405757 he is a good man i have seen the way he cares for his family we have a good relationship he is innocent there is no evidence against him
2405758 he took my hand and kissed it in the most courteous way
2405759 at that moment a wave of recognition passed between us
2405760 the victims of this disaster will not be the culpable but the innocent
2405761 i wish that you would come in through my back door down my hall and into my bed curl yourself around me and let me feel you breathe your arms around me the hurt just falls away you give me comfort and i feel safe you never ask for anything in return and there is no need for words simplicity is what i feel when i am with you and when everything else around me is a spinning world of complicated i welcome your arms around me your fingers on my skin can we stay this way can we promise it will never get complicated can love exist like this

2405790 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2405791 no ones told me that hes going to be starting here again but i would think that if he had a rehabilitation start here and hes still here working out and getting ready for his next one its a possibility
2405792 but i cant say for certain right now id like to have him the guy really pitched well and he demonstrated last night that hes got some pretty good stuff
2405793 i imagine he was very excited and the adrenalin was pumping but he really pitched extremely well we felt that if he gave us four quality innings we could do well but he gave us much more than we felt like we would get from him
2405794 its kind of hard to say right now what were going to do with our rotation but i would think that hed be considered certainly after what he did tonight
2405795 it didnt look like it was going to go our way especially with them bringing in their closer
2405796 hes tough hes not even sidearm hes underneath and the other guy i dont even think ive had a good at bat let alone a hit against the other guy in two years i just went up there and did the best i could to try to take the pressure off the situation and just try to see the ball as well as i could i guess the best thing that happened was that at bat going deep and seeing six or seven pitches if it would have been over in a couple pitches it would have been a lot tougher i was telling tom wilson that i didnt really get good timing on that guy until the sixth or seventh pitch but im just glad it worked out the way it did without good at bats from chris and colin getting that double im not even in that situation
2405797 i felt good back there and i was excited to get back there ive been trying to stay on top of my defensive game by doing defensive drills and other stuff while ive been out
2405798 i remember coming off of the bus after we returned home with the trophy and i had it held over my head just like this and i was told that was the snapshot they took i had on civilian clothes but they put me in a uniform i think its pretty neat its really neat i like this its cool i am certainly appreciative of what theyve done to do this tonight this is pretty good its pretty stylish

2405802 hmmm can i go least favorite id like to see boomer win one of the boomer races im always pulling for him but he never seems to win so my least favorite would probably be the boomer race i like the dizzy bat race thats pretty good ive got a couple ties with the favorite but the least favorite is definitely the boomer race just win one one a year
2405803 jackson once you get him in the right setting and he comes out of his shell hes got a gift he can impersonate anybody just the way he talks he does a southern guy who lives on a farm and so on youve got to get him to do his impersonations sometime hes definitely got a gift he doesnt even know it his best impression is doing skip tony franklin his bad walk his bad hips and running out he does a great impersonation by far the funniest
2405804 my theory on that is there are guys that throw hard and throughout the years when they go on what normally happens is they start losing velocity where guys like us who are consistent 90 90 90 can pitch through the years and are going to stay there but if youre not way up theres not a whole lot to go down there are guys who get guys out who dont throw necessarily hard but can pitch its going to be more beneficial because we know how to pitch we have to pitch we dont rely on fastballs but the guys who have the big fastball they dont have to be so fine sometimes they can throw down the middle but its 95 so it doesnt get hit but when they start struggling and theyre dropping down to 90 now and thats right down the middle theyre not going to get away with it and the guys that throw 95 and can locate are throwing in the big leagues guys like me and chase that have movement and dont throw necessarily hard but can pitch have over the long run a better chance of staying around than guys that throw hard that dont know how to locate
2405805 i dont know if i could compare myself to anybody but i definitely look up to ken griffey jr thats who ive always looked up to hes my favorite player
2405806 yeah definitely just because youve seen that when minor leaguers come in it gives them a spark a little bit it gives the guys who are injured a break they can just step in and play a little role and play their part so definitely anything can happen

2405830 to make this ladys slightly unusual wish come true its possible our staff overstepped the mark and while the wish was carried out in a light hearted way we are sorry if anyone was offended
2405831 the lady herself her family and the member of staff who acted as her waiter believe that while it may have been a bit risque the wish was carried out with the utmost respect for all those involved and taken in the good humoured way it was intended by residents and staff present at the time
2405832 well continue to encourage staff to be innovative in the way we run our care homes but we will be speaking with all our managers to ensure they know where to draw the line in future

2405914 if you havent tired yourself too thoroughly lady i would speak with you for a moment
2405915 make it quick if you can i have need of my lady wife
2405916 i was under the impression lord that need had been lately satisfied
2405917 master there are some needs that can never be fully satisfied
2405918 i had wanted to speak with you upon your return anyway and even as you and the lord rode the need became stronger
2405919 i had a new arrival seek me out asking me a most peculiar question
2405920 simply this if he were to join the guard might he continue to study with master parsons
2405921 i told him no there is only one master here i did however inform him that he might study additionally with the lady should he desire and she agree
2405922 he comes from the shore and claims he is old enough to enlist though i doubt it
2405923 never cut through the ring i know you are accustomed to it being of no consequence given dernstons facilities here it matters show respect for your surroundings and try to not embarrass me
2405924 is being testy some sort of requirement for a swordmaster
2405925 honor integrity and duty before self how does lying to your mother fit those ideals
2405926 but since you are here i would see what the lady has taught you we begin with form 1
2405927 there is only one master here tomas dont keep him waiting
2405928 like many young men he cant see the trees for the forest too focused on the big picture instead of on the paintstrokes that create it that said he has come a long way in the 3 months i worked with him
2405929 as you saw technically his tendency is to attack over aggressively again not uncommon for someone his age but it causes him to miss easy openings or worse create openings for his opponent he did better than usual in his defense however several times you left him glaring openings which he either didnt see or ignored
2405930 he has potential to make a moderate swordsman certainly he should be able to master enough for the guard
2405931 i am given to understand that you wish to become a guardsman
2405932 yet your primary reason is not one of fealty to the crown or devotion to lakosha but a desire to continue studying swordwork
2405933 and moreover you lied to your parents about the purpose of your journey to castleton
2405934 his father is dead which makes his omission both more understandable and far more egregious
2405935 you would not be the first youngster to run off to join the guard and people have joined the guard for worse reasons than to continue learning if you are serious about wishing to enlist
2405936 not only must you learn to not interrupt you must return home inform your mother of your desire and arrange for her to be taken care of in your absence then you may return and enlist
2405937 not the seamstress who once threw a pair of scissors at a customer because they dared suggest a different color fabric
2405938 i understand your desire a bit better now young tomas go home tell her youre joining the guard and come back well make a place for you and well make sure youre not posted near dernston if thats your choice
2405939 gwen take tomas back to the barracks find him a place to sleep overnight it
2405940 you may be ready but your horse needs rest no arguments go with gwen tomorrow is soon enough
2405941 and youve got three who will be that age before you know it
2405942 master i wanted to talk with you regarding adaptation of some of the introductory forms now that our ranks are being joined by more and more young women virtually none of whom have been allowed to so much as hold a sword we need to provide some extra training for them and whatever young men may be in a similar situation
2405943 too often i have heard commanders declare that women are inherently inferior swordsmen i know this is not true and yet here
2405944 we have the first female swordmaster in lakoshan history it has taken too long
2405945 if you and the lord will oblige i wish to see some of the variations our young guest told me youd developed
2405946 the isolation clearly exhibits the adage that necessity is the mother of invention her variations are far beyond her experience the four months will move the training of women in swordwork ahead by years instantly if youd left her there the god only knows what she could have accomplished
2405947 perhaps so but i think you can understand why id rather have had her at my side without interruption
2405948 we will have much to discuss tomorrow given your clear facility for teaching id normally be insisting you be apprenticed to replace me upon retirement but i suppose thats out of the question
2405949 particularly if you keep absconding with her for your own nefarious purposes

2405951 john was turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again
2405952 my marriages collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity
2405953 beyond the majority consensus as defined by the media on the basis of a few sound bites and paying extra attention to dissenting views because they often present important challenges to conventional wisdom on urgent issues that deserve a hearing
2405954 rather than engage speech that strays too far from the dangerously narrow borders of our public discourse the gatekeepers of that discourse our mass media tend to effectively shout it down marginalize it or ignore it
2405955 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2405956 now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2405957 we have been groomed to lead the world the least we can do is reach out to those that cant help themselves it is but a modest attempt to rekindle hope where there is none
2405958 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with senator obama than senator mccain
2405959 senator obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2405960 that is a stock approach here candidates use controversial personal attacks as a means of attracting free news coverage
2405961 lose a war in order to win a political campaign
2405962 the candidate of fresh optimistic change cannot afford to go too negative
2405963 mccain is also now given more leeway to go negative since he is the underdog it isnt fair but nothing about politics is fair
2405964 political scientists and communications scholars will tell you that negative ads tend to have more information in them than positive ads
2405965 we see positive ads that are false or misleading too
2405966 being president is a tough job ask bush or clinton
2405967 having a negative campaign run against you is a test of your toughness you come out of the election battle tested
2405968 just for today i will accept the hand that is dealt no complaining
2405969 just for today i will think only positive thoughts about myself no criticism

2405982 there are a ton of different paths that lead to doom
2405983 if there is a silver lining in all of this its that users will become more aware and more conscious of who they do business with
2405984 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
2405985 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site
2405986 the fact of the matter is that there have been many ways like phishing attacks to misdirect them for a long time and this is just yet another of those ways that will be surgically exploited
2405987 the industry has rallied like weve never seen the industry rally before
2405988 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades
2405989 the biggest gap in security rests between the keyboard and the back of the chair
2405990 the look and feel of a website is not what a consumer should trust they should trust the security behind that website and do simple things like use more secure passwords and change their password regularly
2405991 we have been trained since we were young to lock the door to our house our car we take these sensible security measures in the environment we are functioning in

2405995 we have seven years to ensure that our country and our city are ready to host the best olympic games in the history of the world
2405996 hosting the olympics would both mark chinas triumphant arrival as a fully respectable country on the world scene and demonstrate exactly that to the population at home
2405997 seize the opportunity of a century to realise the dream of a century
2405998 it will show that china is now powerful not backward
2405999 olympic dreams china and sports 1895 2008 has just been published says china was genuinely surprised at how the world viewed the country
2406000 china devised the slogan one world one dream for the olympics but the rest of the world doesnt share that dream with them
2406001 if we could see a change in the burmese government people could move home in safety that would be the best result

2406003 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information

2406020 e nei suoi ricordi compare un uomo una specie di mago lo ha aiutato diverse volte sopratutto quando ha deciso di fermare la guerra tra gli d i che minacciava la sopravvivenza del mondo
2406021 mi hanno dato spesso unet superiore alla mia ma qui si esagera quanti millenni dovrei avere stando al tuo amico se fossi pi permaloso mi potrei anche offendere sai
2406022 lo so che suona assurdo ma in effetti i vostri volti sono praticamente identici beh a parte che il vostro pi vecc pi maturo
2406023 beh comunque sia io non ho millenni di vita alle spalle tutto qui
2406024 vecchio basta con questi giochetti mi ricordo bene di te anche se sembri invecchiato cosa che non mi sorprende visto che in effetti dovresti essere morto da diverso tempo
2406025 anymartis suppongo complimenti non pensavo riusucissi gi a prendere totalmente il controllo come hai fatto adesso di punto in bianco
2406026 dimmi come hai fatto a sopravvivere tutto questo tempo e quale scopo persegui stavolta
2406027 se pensi di conoscermi se pensi che io sia un mago che vive da diversi millenni dimmi anymartis reincarnarti ti ha forse privato del senno o pensi che in millenni di vita un mago non possa acquisire poteri con i quali distruggerti con una sola occhiata stai bene attento
2406028 bene mi hai davvero stupito non pensavo ricordassi gi tutto quanto comunque era solo questione di tempo peccato cominciava a piacermi il ruolo delleremita
2406029 si come hai detto prima sono io come mai sono ancora vivo dopo tutto questo tempo beh sono fatti miei e non intendo rivelarteli ti basti sapere che dopo che salvasti il mondo divenni il discepolo di un altro mago molto potente e alla sua morte i suoi poteri ed il suo ruolo sono passati a me
2406030 il suo ruolo esatto ormai sono il custode delle ombre guardiano dei confini del mondo titoli che immagino non ti diranno niente ti basti sapere che evito che molte creature arrivino nel mondo alterandone gli equilibri
2406031 se non fosse stato per me ora saresti probabilmente morto o rinchiuso in un corpo impazzito perch dilaniato da due anime mi aspettavo almeno un grazie
2406032 oh certo grazie ma non cambiare il discorso perch mi hai aiutato che vuoi da me
2406033 gi perch ti ho aiutato riguarda un altro dei miei compiti un compito triste e gravoso ma che mi devo accollare
2406034 per ora non te lo posso dire posso per dirti che di fondamentale importanza per il futuro del mondo di nuovo
2406035 beh intanto dovresti liberare in fretta la citt della povera slija dal dominio malvagio di regis e per ora mi pare che i nostri interessi coincidano no
2406036 tanto lo stavo andando ad uccidere quindi il fatto che la cosa serva anche a te non mi interessa ma perch non ci vai da solo ormai sarai potentissimo no
2406037 il mio ruolo mi proibisce di interferire troppo direttamente nelle vicende del mondo ci sono in gioco poteri troppo grandi perch tu possa comprenderli ma se io intervenissi di persona accadrebbero diverse cose spiacevoli credimi
2406038 bene ti credo sulla parola allora non avr aiuto da parte tua giusto
2406039 in parte ma recentemente ho avuto un paio di ospiti nella grotta e penso ti tornerebbero molto utili contro regis e pure in futuro

2406074 the structure of american schooling 20th century style began in 1806 when napoleons amateur soldiers beat the professional soldiers of prussia at the battle of jena
2406075 our form of compulsory schooling is an invention of the state of massachusetts around 1850 it was resisted sometimes with guns by an estimated eighty per cent of the massachusetts population the last outpost in barnstable on cape cod not surrendering its children until the 1880s when the area was seized by militia and children marched to school under guard
2406076 the next step came in 1890 when andrew carnegie wrote eleven essays called the gospel of wealth in it he said that capitalism free enterprise was stone cold dead in the united states it had been killed by its own success that men like himself mr morgan and mr rockefeller now owned everything they owned the government competition was impossible unless they allowed it which human nature being what it is was a problematical thing carnegie said that this was a very dangerous situation because eventually young people will become aware of this and form clandestine organizations to work against it ultimately theyll bring down this edifice youve got to read all eleven essays sometimes several times and only then the majesty of the design emerges carnegie proposed that men of wealth re establish a synthetic free enterprise system since the real one was no longer possible based on cradle to grave schooling the people who advanced most successfully in the schooling that was available to everyone would be given licenses to lead profitable lives they would be given jobs and promotions and that a large part of the economy had to be tied directly to schooling

2406214 pierzynski was further away than i thought i cost us a run
2406215 believe me its easier for us not to face ramirez but i dont think theyre going to make the trade if they feel they dont still have a good offense without him
2406216 did the trade surprise me i dont know what went on there but it did surprise me sometimes people need to get something done to show they lead the ballclub
2406217 it surprised me when it happened i would have bet my house and everything and i would have lost but the red sox do good business they know what theyre doing and you have to respect that
2406218 i dont know because i wasnt there but believe me i never think mannys a quitter and he never will be

2406221 one thing ill say about terry francona is that hes got two world series rings
2406222 believe me he doesnt give a care what people say and think about him he just worries about how many wins hes going to have at the end of the year terry francona went on the biggest stage for a manager twice now and handled it real well
2406223 the threat is a little different and the pitchers are going to be able to relax a little but this is still a good red sox ballclub
2406224 they still have a lot of offense they still have people that can hurt you behind those guys and you have to respect that

2406229 the numbers are almost irrelevant if i feel good at the plate im going to get hits but when you dont feel like theres a consistency i feel like im battling that and thats hard
2406230 they can put the ball on a tee for you if you dont feel good consistent theres no guarantee youre going to get hits but youre not going to cry
2406231 im not going to make any excuses for him but he is michael will hit period i dont think there are two ways around it michael will hit hes just missing some balls

2406275 is not about georgia anymore its about america its values america stands up for those freedom loving nations and supports them thats what america is all about
2406276 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2406277 i think our european and american colleagues should understand what is happening and i hope very much that they will reach the right conclusions
2406278 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil

2406286 this is a twist on an age old question does a belief in god influence moral behaviour
2406287 we asked does the concept of god influence cooperative behaviour
2406288 we did not anticipate such a subtle prime simply getting participants to unscramble sentences with a few key words having such a large effect on peoples willingness to give money to strangers
2406289 these are compelling findings that have substantial impact on the study of social behaviour because they draw a causal relationship between religion and acting morally a topic of some debate they by no means indicate that religion is necessary for moral behaviour but it can make a substantial contribution
2406290 the issues discussed by harris and koenig are crucial if we are to take seriously the importance of culture in cognitive development
2406291 we dont have a firm view on why it is theyre a bit more confident on the scientific information
2406292 but one possible plausible reason is that when we talk about things like germs or body organs we talk in a very matter of fact fashion
2406293 its intriguing to think that parents might talk differently to their children about science and spirituality and i d imagine there is a great deal of cultural variation in those discussions
2406294 harris and koenig draw our attention to an aspect of cognitive development that is too often neglected the need for children to rely extensively on culturally transmitted information while simultaneously erecting safeguards against misleading or deceptive input

2406355 twenty five years ago this week in his thanksgiving proclamation ronald reagan wrote that america was set apart from other nations in an uncommon way
2406356 he said that it was his belief that a divine plan placed this great continent here between the oceans to be found by people from every corner of the earth who had a special love of faith and freedom
2406357 americas love of faith and freedom is as strong today as it was 25 years ago or indeed 225 years ago
2406358 we are in a political season now and sometimes it might feel that there is much that divides us
2406359 and let us also pause to give special thanks and praise to the men and women of our armed forces and their families stationed across the globe
2406360 the thompson family wishes you a safe and joyous thanksgiving god bless you and god bless america thank you
2406361 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
2406362 o give thanks unto the god of gods for his mercy endureth forever
2406363 unto thee o god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare
2406364 to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent o lord my god i will give thanks unto thee forever
2406365 offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high
2406366 save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise
2406367 i will praise the name of god with a song and will magnify him with thanksgiving
2406368 although many individuals with disabilities turn to religion to help them deal with their situations to date religion is infrequently discussed in rehabilitation settings and is rarely investigated in rehabilitation research to better meet the needs of persons with disabilities this needs to change
2406369 although some professionals may feel uncomfortable obtaining information about patients religious beliefs it is no different than inquiring about their sexual psychological substance use and legal histories
2406370 it is also very important that rehabilitation professionals be aware of the different religious customs that should be considered when evaluating and treating patients including information regarding the appropriateness of physical touching by others preferences regarding gender specific services dress and hygiene customs

2406377 the deepening conflict between russia and georgia is particulary vexing to the u n security council which met well into the night thursday and again on friday to reach an agreement on how to phrase a call for an end to the use of force and a return to the negotiating table
2406378 since russia is a veto holding member of the u n security council the negotiations were an attempt to keep russia on board while the u s took a stand in support of the pro western government of georgia and defended what it called georgias sovereignty and terroritorial integrity
2406379 but the fighting on the ground made an agreement difficult since neither russia nor georgia are a member of nato
2406380 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2406381 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2406382 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2406383 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2406384 throughout our history alabamians have turned in prayer to god to humbly ask for his blessings and to hold us steady during times of difficulty this drought is without question a time of great difficulty for our farmers and for communities across the state
2406385 alabama farmers have been through tough times before but through gods grace they have learned to withstand whatever circumstances they faced the farmers have been praying for rain for weeks and they covet the prayers of their fellow alabamians
2406386 there are many references in the bible to gods assurance of answering prayer but maybe the most fitting for our current situation is found in 2 chronicles 7 14 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land we need gods forgiveness and our land needs his healing this verse of scripture tells us how to achieve that
2406387 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2406388 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2406389 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2406390 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2406391 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2406392 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2406393 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2406394 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2406395 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2406396 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2406397 were you aware that patients could get up sometimes an hour later and walk out
2406398 the sales people were going out to hospitals and to surgeons saying you need to do this as inpatient
2406399 as a salesman you were making a lot of money
2406400 i mean as a sales person you love to make money but you want to make money ethically
2406401 in the middle of the presentation the general counsel stopped and says its not your job to police the sales force
2406402 so the head lawyer of the company was telling you this
2406403 absolutely i told him i understood what my job was but we were breaking the law every day and we needed to fix it
2406404 we can create the fastest growing economy in the world we can have a successful olympic games why cant we elect our own leaders
2406405 you never knew what they were going to reject you for
2406406 if you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth the lord jesus christ and believe in your heart that god raised jesus from the dead you will be save
2406407 i expect the best and with gods help attain the best
2406408 i expect the best and get it with gods help

2406410 the calvo family members were the apparent victims of a local drug ring
2406411 i called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the familys beloved dogs
2406412 the deputies opened fire and executed our dogs the very second they broke down our front door
2406413 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2406414 but i think its also the kind of thing that happens and i dont think we would have realized that until it happened to us
2406415 is they didnt have a proper warrant to do what they did they actually didnt give us a warrant at all until 71 hours after it happened and thats really whats disturbing despite all the mistakes that were made theyre holding to their guns saying they did nothing wrong
2406416 this happened to us we cant get our dogs back and we know that but the reason we asked for federal authorities to investigate this is because this is a systemic problem and we want to make sure that while it happened to us and thats a tragedy we dont want it to happen to anyone else
2406417 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2406418 our research suggest that religious coping may help buffer cardiovascular disease in african americans
2406419 this finding may have important implications given the high prevalence of hypertension and hypertension related diseases in that population
2406420 the holy god having by a long and continual series of his afflictive dispensations in and by the present warr with the heathen natives of this land written and brought to pass bitter things against his own covenant people in this wilderness yet so that we evidently discern that in the midst of his judgements he hath remembered mercy having remembered his footstool in the day of his sore displeasure against us for our sins with many singular intimations of his fatherly compassion and regard reserving many of our towns from desolation threatened and attempted by the enemy and giving us especially of late with many of our confederates many signal advantages against them without such disadvantage to ourselves as formerly we have been sensible of if it be the lords mercy that we are not consumed it certainly bespeaks our positive thankfulness when our enemies are in any measure disappointed or destroyed and fearing the lord should take notice under so many intimations of his returning mercy we should be found an insensible people as not standing before him with thanksgiving as well as lading him with our complaints in the time of pressing afflictions the council has thought meet to appoint and set apart the 29th day of this instant june as a day of solemn thanksgiving and praise to god for such his goodness and favour many particulars of which mercy might be instanced but we doubt not those who are sensible of gods afflictions have been as diligent to espy him returning to us and that the lord may behold us as a people offering praise and thereby glorifying him the council doth commend it to the respective ministers elders and people of this jurisdiction solemnly and seriously to keep the same beseeching that being perswaded by the mercies of god we may all even this whole people offer up our bodies and soulds as a living and acceptable service unto god by jesus christ
2406421 this tells us there is another face of adoption it is more complex than we had thought
2406422 weve seen an increase in same sex couples adopting and this is a trend all over the country
2406423 if you think about same sex couples gay men who want children really have to adopt but gay women can have their own children i dont see as many gay female couples adopting as gay male couples
2406424 it is not just white married couples who are adopting children
2406425 because the characteristics of children that women and couples seek to adopt may not correspond to the characteristics of children in the foster care system women and couples may seek children from outside the foster care system to adopt
2406426 having a dream wedding can result in a financial nightmare for couples who spend more than they can realistically afford
2406427 the financial strain can take a toll on the best of relationships and can significantly reduce the chances of a successful marriage

2406446 you have breakfast and you want breakfast again a couple of hours later
2406447 you just drag food around with you all the time
2406448 its really a time crunch especially with the multi sport because youre trying to fit your run your bike and your swim all in and its really difficult to get it all in and work eight hours a day
2406449 as much as i love going to the rinks and watching hockey i didnt want to be on the road five or six days a week at this stage of my career
2406450 so i decided to stay with the whl and join the raiders organization
2406451 being in spokane as a part of the chiefs organization was an incredible experience
2406452 i enjoyed my time there a whole bunch but it was time to lessen my work load
2406453 it was time to step back and try something new
2406454 dave and i worked together for seven or eight years in spokane
2406455 then last year we chatted a little bit about joining the raiders staff i guess things just kind of progressed from there
2406456 i like the message he was preaching if preaching is the right word

2406472 during the investigation an unprecedented level of surveillance has been undertaken we have been looking at meetings movement travel spending and the aspirations of a large group of people the investigation reached a critical point last night when the decision was made to take urgent action in order to disrupt what we believe was being planned

2406476 ich kann es nur wiederholen die penisgr e ist sehr wichtig beim sex das hei t nicht dass er unbedingt 20 cm lang sein muss aber 15 w ren schon gut
2406477 etwas kompliziert wird es nur wenn er wirklich zu klein ist
2406478 ich war total verliebt und dachte nicht mehr an meinen ehemaligen als wir nach einem sehr sch nen abend zu mir gingen schmusten wir und landeten schlie lich im bett es wurde eine entt uschende nacht obwohl ich immer dachte auf die gr e kommt es nicht an sp rte ich einfach nichts
2406479 mit sicherheit ist die breite auch entscheidend denn sorry was soll eine frau bei z b 2 cm durchmesser f hlen
2406480 jaaaaaaa die penisgr sse ist wichtig weil ein mini penis einfach nichts bringt
2406481 ich leide sehr unter meinem kleinen busen vielleicht stehe ich deshalb nur auf jungs mit gro en schw nzen irgendwie alles total ungerecht
2406482 im gro en und ganzen ist die gr e nicht wirklich wichtig
2406483 es macht mich einfach total an das gef hl ihn in den mund zu nehmen ist einmalig und ich bekomme manchmal allein davon schon einen orgasmus wenn er dann mit seiner prallen gr e in mich eindringt bin ich rettungslos verloren
2406484 also zu klein ist einfach nur bl d zu gross tut weh und macht keinen spass ich mag sie am liebsten sch n dick und augenma so 15 cm
2406485 das geschwafel dass es nicht auf die gr e ankommt nervt total habe einen sehr einf hlsamen mann mit dem der sex immer wie im lehrbuch abl uft und auch spass macht aber was w rde ich darum geben nur mal 5 minuten von einem riesengro en schw gesto en zu werden
2406486 hmm es stimmt schon da der umfang mehr ausmacht aber ehrlich gesagt find ich einen gr eren schon irgendwie erregender nat rlich kein monstrum von ber 20 cm aber so 16 19 f nd ich geil
2406487 ich bin seit 2 monaten in einer sehr harmonischen und wunderbaren beziehung allerdings habe ich ein problem mit dem penis meines freundes er ist ziemlich klein ich bef rchte nun ich m chte irgendwann auch nochmal sex mit einem mann der einen gr eren penis hat
2406488 ich hatte vorher drei freunde mit kleineren penissen und noch nie einen vaginalen orgasmus erst jetzt wei ich wie sch n es sein kann
2406489 ich meine man h rt ja st ndig und von jeder seite dass die penisgr e nicht wichtig sei
2406490 nein es kommt nicht nur auf die gr e an aber da kann mann noch so motiviert sein wenn er zu klein ist bringt auch kreativit t im bett nichts da kannst du mir ruhig glauben ich war immerhin 4 jahre mit so jemandem verheiratet

2406494 the greek anti doping body has requested that the greek athletics federation withdraw the athlete from the games
2406495 it was not an ioc test it is a greek affair it is a national case
2406496 all necessary action to clarify the incident and a further statement will follow after the second sample is analyzed
2406497 all the hard work weve put in to this dance is going to be for nothing all because im not popular enough in this town

2406502 zach was looking a finn coach he had worked with kenneth and liked him i suggested calling to see if he was interested
2406503 it turned out to be a really good fit i helped out zach at his olympic trials
2406504 it has made them both better and the distance to ben is less on a good day they can beat him
2406505 ben has a long list of credits hes a returning double gold champion
2406506 but there are still 24 other sailors out there i have to worry about
2406507 when the olympics start both of us will try as hard as we can i dont think there will be any dirty tricks but we will race hard
2406508 its difficult when people just expect you to win and probably secretly hope that you lose for a change pressure is something you just have to deal with and it doesnt get any easier but it is also part of the thrill of competing at the highest level
2406509 china is seriously concerned about the worsening situation and armed conflict in south ossetia
2406510 we call on the relevant parties to keep restraint and cease fire immediately
2406511 we sincerely expect the parties concerned to settle the dispute through dialogue and safeguard the regional peace and stability
2406512 china is ready to work with turkmenistan to promote bilateral reciprocal cooperation in the fields of economy and trade energy security and culture among others and continuously raise the level of bilateral cooperation
2406513 we have no hesitation in talking to the delegation if these three leaders are kept out of negotiations
2406514 the constitution of an apex body for management of maritime affairs is an important step which would facilitate quick decision making and rapid response
2406515 this we think is not the right thing to do for example fisheries and resources of the seas come under ministry of agriculture and certain other things are under the ministry of shipping and transport
2406516 we need to have an organisational structure in which representatives of both these ministries sit together so that we can take action that will be required when there is an emergency situation
2406517 goddamnit i neeeeeeed a gorillapod its exactly what i need in this exact situation
2406518 yeah ill totally investigate this further thanks for the hot tip
2406519 obama the patriot removes american flag from his plane barack obama recently finished a 500 000 total overhaul of his 757 and as part of the new design he decided to remove the american flag from the tail what american running for president of the united states would remove the symbol of his country and worse he replaced the flag with it with a symbol of himself
2406520 please forward this on if youre not ashamed of your country or its flag amp think this is a disgrace
2406521 although senator barack obama flew on a variety of aircraft during the long campaign season from march through june 2008 he primarily used a boeing 757 200er aircraft chartered from and operated by north american airlines as his campaign plane during that period the plane bore the standard color scheme and company markings of a north american airlines aircraft however once the primary campaign effectively ended and senator obama became the presumptive democratic presidential nominee his campaign plane underwent a month long refurbishment to prepare it for the general election campaign a process that included reconfiguring the interior seating and modifying the exterior markings to identify and publicize the aircraft as barack obamas official campaign plane
2406522 well ive heard this just enough that it makes me uneasy
2406523 the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is slave to the lender
2406524 i will keep on fencing after the olympics since i like it im looking forward to the london games
2406525 i was too nervous to compete just now against bao i dont think i had given my full play in the match
2406526 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
2406527 unless there is a real partnership i e more money for us among game marketers and artists and labels wmg will be hesitant about going further to license its music for video games
2406528 we hope china and the philippines forge ahead with the existing trade and economic cooperation projects and explore new fields of cooperation at the same time
2406529 is beneficial to strengthening the friendly feelings between the two peoples and beneficial to improving the relations of the two countries
2406530 i hope the two sides can continue to make joint efforts to remove various kinds of interference constantly enhance mutual trust and push forward the sino french comprehensive strategic partnership in a healthy and stable way
2406531 to develop strategic partnership with china is a principle of frances foreign policy and will not change
2406532 today is not only a day the chinese people are proud of but also a day of historic significance in terms of sino french relationship
2406533 we expect and believe france can play a more positive and constructive role in stabilizing and developing sino european relations and hope the two countries can cooperate closely to host the seventh summit of the asia europe meeting and the 11th china eu summit meeting
2406534 the idea of watching a 14 hour delay is repulsive

2406544 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2406545 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2406546 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2406547 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2406548 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community

2406555 i do feel i am ready to give it my best shot this season
2406556 i remember last year i could not walk after three days pre season this year though pre season went by easily all the running stuff so i think i have become stronger
2406557 football wise it is still a very different game from the one we play back in holland
2406558 i feel i am more prepared for the matches this campaign everything last season was very new
2406559 i will be honest and say last season there were a few times when i wondered if i had made the right decision about coming to scotland going to a foreign country
2406560 the centre half we had on trial was just a bit too laid back
2406561 gordon has a great reputation across the border and rightly so
2406562 thats not just because of the success hes had here but also through the success he has had at other clubs in his career
2406563 gordon is a proven football manager and knows what it takes to win football matches so he will always be a manager that clubs covet
2406564 it is no surprise to me what gordon has achieved with celtic
2406565 human rights were an inherent part of our culture before its discovery by some others in the aftermath bloody global wars and the deaths of innocent millions caused by misguided philosophies
2406566 i basically took the 12 best charges and presented them to the grand jury
2406567 this isnt a situation where if he isnt convicted we will bring forth more charges
2406568 this is a man who spent a great deal of his own money to do missionary work in other countries
2406569 he provided free medical clinics for the poor so the depiction of him as a greedy doctor who was selling prescriptions for 50 a pop sounds completely out of character for him
2406570 i would hope that this means there is a lot of positive interest in the school district
2406571 mark mason moved from the school district leaving an open seat on the board
2406572 his letter of resignation was received july 28 and the board has 30 days to appoint a person to his seat
2406573 a lot of people have been learning english to connect with more people
2406574 ive been watching the date for so long saying its coming its coming
2406575 of the greatest scale and size we have ever seen in beijing
2406576 we have worked very hard for nearly seven years since the successful bidding for holding the 2008 olympic games
2406577 compared to other events it is in a league of its own i feel honored and excited to be on the staff
2406578 the applicant had to possess a good mastery of english
2406579 i would be gone for half a year and not recognize it beijing has changed day by day we want the world to join us and see that we are strong enough to handle the biggest event in the world
2406580 from their hearts they wish to be open and make friends people make mistakes and the olympic games is an opportunity to make other countries see what china is like
2406581 we found an imprint of instructions on how to make a pipe bomb on a blank sheet of paper in a notebook
2406582 the sheet of paper on which the instructions were written had been torn out
2406583 also we found indications that someone in the residence was attempting to obtain a bulletproof vest over the internet we dont know if they were successful
2406584 in addition were investigating a recovered stolen vehicle that was found burned in hockingport which is located near coolville and sliders residence
2406585 the vehicle was stolen from c amp c dodge toyota in marietta
2406586 we just want the public to know that hes still out there armed and possibly wearing a bulletproof vest
2406587 if anyone sees the suspect dont try to approach him just call the police
2406588 we sealed the entire truck to preserve any evidence and sent it to our lab in charleston for processing
2406589 but the first couple of days after the incident we received several tips
2406590 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2406591 democracy and human rights are more important than the olympics
2406592 der krisenstab wolle die verschleppten wieder in sichere obhut zu bringen
2406593 the first set i won 6 3 but i really didnt feel super comfortable
2406594 the second set was probably the first really good set i have played in four months i started to move the ball around well so that was a really good feeling
2406595 i think this match could be one that i look back on as a turning point in the year
2406596 i made a couple of mistakes the guy started to feel much more comfortable on the court and the momentum was gone
2406597 i didnt serve very well in the third set and the balls are pretty slow so it was difficult for my game i could not change it by serving and volleying it was perfect for him because he was playing very simple tennis
2406598 yes it would be good if i am but i am not going to shoot myself if i am not
2406599 sorry tim ive got work at 8 am tomorrow and im not spending my entire tuesday evening making a bowl of fettucini

2406602 i hear jerusalem bells a ringing roman cavalry choirs are singing
2406603 the ear should remain the first and last court of appeal
2406604 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2406605 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2406606 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2406607 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
2406608 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2406609 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2406610 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2406611 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2406612 put a smile on someones face by thinking globally and acting locally
2406613 ive been doing business with him for at least 10 years hes always been wonderful with paying me
2406614 hes spent a lot of money with me i thought we have a really good relationship i dont know what happened unless its a misunderstanding
2406615 people told me dont mess with jay z at all then i did the same exact people told me nah kanyes not the one including jay z

2406708 these investors from u k have already invested in markets like spain portugal carribean and dubai and are looking at india as a potential for investment but they are skeptical of doing so because they do not have knowledge of the market in the country
2406709 investors need someone who has the whole chain covered for them

2406723 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2406724 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2406725 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2406726 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2406727 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2406728 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2406729 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2406731 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2406735 i cant quite handle the idea of screen actress in big west end hit and all that i would prefer to do something smaller maybe at the bush hall which is one of my favourite theatres
2406736 the idea of doing theatre scares me in an exciting way but doing any part always terrifies me

2406809 usa gymnastics was able to get a few more tickets i filled out a form and was able to purchase a couple of tickets to go over there its a pretty amazing feeling
2406810 im looking forward to tom being here and being in the crowd
2406811 he woke up thursday morning and could feel something under his kneecap
2406812 he got an mri it was a cartilage problem we expect him back for the start of the season
2406813 the guys 430 years old so this is nothing to him
2406814 its another day at the office when he played in denver he actually got his knee scoped the day after a game and played the next game so he heals fast
2406815 everybody in the leagues working with these problems and weve got to work through it
2406816 weve been in contact with him if he gets in shape then another chapter in the charles spencer story could be written with our team
2406817 hes running the ball so well now that were not going to abandon his opportunity to be one of our backs carrying the ball
2406818 were just trying to be smart and giving him a few reps each day at both of the backs positions that way hes learning and hell be ready to do that during the season if we need him to play fullback
2406819 he still makes fun of me like he did when i was a little kid
2406820 he would pick me up and toss me in the chalk bucket and throw me in the foam pit
2406821 is almost like my little brother i never would have imagined that two guys from the same club gym could end up on the same olympic team together but here we are
2406822 the world has given its love and trust to china and today china will give the world a big warm hug
2406823 i realized the pros dont hit it any farther than i do
2406824 when i hit my driver like i did friday this is an easy sport
2406825 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2406826 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2406827 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leader board and feeling the good vibes
2406828 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2406829 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2406830 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2406831 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2406832 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2406833 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2406834 my dad was really proud and he was ready to go
2406835 so now i have to tell him sorry dad this is a scam that is very sad
2406836 i have heard story after story after story about how this was to be a gift recognition award
2406837 ive had parents who said they cant look their children in the face and tell them that their dreams have been destroyed
2406838 hes in beijing and of course they are very upset
2406839 you know and i know that if you and i decide to get in the t shirt business and we decided to print up a couple of thousand t shirts and put the olympic rings on it the police would show up at 3 oclock in the morning with the cease and desist order because they wouldnt tolerate people stealing revenue from the ioc
2406840 but we look at situations on a case by case basis because there are sometimes circumstances around it that make it not possible for somebody to meet that time frame
2406841 i think close to 3 billion people are going to be watching that game
2406842 thats what they say thats what i hear thats a lot of people
2406843 the atmosphere is going to be crazy were playing against the home team to open up the olympics and im pretty sure its going to be crazy and energetic in there everybody in that building is going to be jumping its the biggest game on the biggest stage in the world
2406844 i will have to take a breath at the beginning of this game
2406845 it is the start of the first olympic games to be played in china it is the event that my country and i have been looking to for seven years since beijing was awarded the games
2406846 i am so happy that i have been able to recover from my foot injury to be ready to play against the usa team will be a great challenge and a great honor
2406847 you can take a game 7 and multiply it by seven its going to be something that nobodys experienced before i dont know if anybodys had a president come to a game to watch them play before
2406848 if you can just imagine and try to wrap your minds around the opening tip with dwight howard and yao ming as soon as that ball goes up every camera in the building is going to be flashing media going to be writing stories were going to be cheering
2406849 just thinking about this first game now you get goose bumps
2406850 its something well be able to tell our kids and our grand kids that we took part in the largest sporting event ever
2406851 he is an excellent blocker you know being a receiver and being a good blocker is more about being willing in all honesty
2406852 youve got to know you stick your face in there and what we do offensively its important that we have people that will do that but hes done it since hes been here so its nothing new
2406853 hes just one of those kids hell do whatever the hell you ask him to
2406854 you have to be fast and youve got to be physical because on special teams there are some guys who are crazy and you have to be just as crazy to be out there
2406855 thats what we want to do offensively weve got to have guys that go out there and dig out safeties and stuff in the run game he reminds me of a kid who played for me a long time ed mccaffrey
2406856 what happens to guys that people say they are lacking this or lacking that they find a way to make up for it kevin in his career has become such a technician at what he does that if hes lacking a tenth of a second here or there speed wise hell find a way to make it up
2406857 from day one ive always known that i could go out there and make plays
2406858 its just all about the opportunity to go out there and do that i feel ive become a better all around receiver this year and im excited to go out there and show that
2406859 the learning experience has been beneficial to my maturity and growth and i have finally been on most all of the race tracks around the country
2406860 it has taught me patience and perseverance and helped me to learn a lot about people at a very young age i wouldnt trade this experience for the world
2406861 even after a successful launch year with joe gibbs racing they did not have the sponsorship to put me back into a nationwide car and i wasnt ready for cup at the time
2406862 the kleenex deal came up and even though it was an independent team j d gibbs told me it would give me the last piece of experience i needed by running every weekend we took the deal and it has been an incredibly humbling experience
2406863 the sprint cup opportunity with hall of fame is a blessing and i am looking forward to my first race at michigan
2406864 it will be an honor to drive for this team which has some deep texas roots it is owned by a great group of big time sports people including troy aikman and roger staubach so this team will be deep in the heart of texas and give our great state a nascar team to cheer for
2406865 while we do have a good points lead we are in no position to take it easy for the next few weeks
2406866 after wrecking the car a few weeks ago we had to replace all the front suspension and straighten the frame in the rear so last week was a good week for our team
2406867 that was a special time everyone in the town was on cloud nine and to repeat that feeling would be remarkable
2406868 our goal is to make teams work to get downfield against us
2406869 far too often last season opponents were able to score quickly against us we had a great spring in the system and the guys feel good about it
2406870 the uca game was probably the worst example of how we played defensively
2406871 no question that day was where we hit rock bottom as a team
2406872 im a sagittarius you indicated that this was the year for great success for me in every way i recently had one major success and there are many others i am waiting for what can i do to make things happen for myself in career wealth money love and creative expression
2406873 we investigated her allegations before filing charges and were unable to substantiate any of them
2406874 no one can say i can be a better mother so im going to take these children you dont just run off with someone elses kids theres a proper way to do things a proper way to go about things
2406875 the deeper we get into it the more i realize how justified she was in her fears
2406876 what she should have done is file guardianship over the kids well probably do that now
2406877 if thats true why are they just now reporting it a year later
2406878 ms tavey had ample opportunity to address whatever concerns that she had concocted
2406879 she failed to do so and would not do so
2406880 thats when the authorities were forced to put out the amber alert and go looking for her and the children even when she said she was going to turn herself in she didnt and had to be sought after and arrested
2406881 im a sagittarius you indicated that this was the year for great success for me in every way i recently had one major success and there are many others i am waiting for what can i do to make things happen for myself in career wealth money love and creative expression

2406883 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2406884 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2406885 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2406886 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2406887 the forecast calls for a 60 chance of poopiness with mostly gross skies and temperatures low in the depths of the sweater drawer
2406888 wow she sure is a loser doing a post on a friday night
2406889 before stating what took place between general lee and myself i will give all there is of the story of the famous apple tree
2406890 its good for a sportsman to be recognized for his performances but i have to say that the titles won last year by the team are far more important
2406891 estimates that he is one of the top 100 guitar hero players in the world

2406904 refused to listen to reason continued to interfere and threatened the officers with lawsuits
2406905 i saw what i believed to be a civil rights violation
2406906 there are gunshots in my neighborhood all the time people get killed in my neighborhood all the time so i wanted to know what was going on
2406907 based on my training there was no probable cause for them to search that trunk
2406908 they dont put witnesses in the report because they dont anybody to see what they do
2406909 they are trying to cover their butt they are trying to create probable cause
2406910 it seems as if she injected herself into a situation without knowing any of the facts made assumptions that were false and then was critical of officers who were doing their jobs
2406911 interfering with police officers in the execution of an arrest creates an unsafe situation for officers out there
2406912 there are laws that prevent citizens from interfering with police officers performing their duties these laws are essential to allow officers to do their jobs
2406913 the houston police department will enforce all of those laws impartially
2406914 i agree with the governor that we need to address the ethanol mandate
2406915 i think that well address the issues of the election when the election comes im really putting my efforts on helping the candidates who are up in 2008 and i will be ready to go for 2010 when the time comes
2406916 im not going to make an announcement right now but im on the road
2406917 in many respects this wind industry is a learning process
2406918 the texas coast will be the toughest place to build wind farms from an ecological perspective
2406919 our intention has always been to deliver the benefits of renewable energy while minimizing any impact to the environment
2406920 we were meticulous in the way we approached the development of this wind farm which we believe will be used as a model for future wind farms around the country
2406921 this shows that people will not stand for being illegally arrested mr perez stood up for his rights

2406924 architecturally speaking its the most beautiful pool ive ever seen
2406925 you can imagine it jam packed and loud being in that atmosphere is something im looking forward to
2406926 i grew up doing a lot of events ever since i was 10 11 12
2406927 ive always swum doubles i feel im well prepared i feel confident
2406928 at the time i had the american record until katie broke it i figured this is my last shot at doing the im on the international level i have nothing to lose
2406929 thats still no excuse we may have made mistakes but well be glad to fix anything weve done
2406930 the price of gas then was probably 2 something a gallon
2406931 we get points and we can trade them in for gift cards but as time went on the real benefit was in the riding and sharing
2406932 many believe that today is a lucky day in the chinese belief 8 8 8 is a lucky number
2406933 a lot of people tried to get married today i just performed one at 2 oclock today
2406934 8 8 8 for us has been a different experience its been a bad day from this experience we certainly know that good things and bad things can happen any day any time
2406935 this is to welcome the deceased home those who have passed away
2406936 but i always think of when our christ was dying on the cross he didnt say a lot but what he taught is to have a great trust in the lord even when things dont make sense
2406937 the pilgrims who left yesterday encountered jesus suddenly and he is walking with them
2406938 we know they were people of great faith and that jesus walks with them
2406939 brothers and sisters on behalf of cardinal dinardo i wish to express my deepest condolences
2406940 there was a like a shadow over all of us
2406941 he was going to go in a van with the son but he wanted to go with his friends on the bus
2406942 we will pray for those who died to go to heaven and for those who survived to let them have courage and consolation from god
2406943 i will tell my parishioners we dont know what happened but we are not the owners of our lives
2406944 god created everything we have to trust in god accept everything that he has given us and pray for the victims those who died went to heaven and god will watch those in the hospitals and help them
2406945 every one of us feels related in some way to the people on the bus
2406946 we suffered in our old country we suffered while we were leaving and now when we come here and a tragedy like this happens it impacts us all we stand by each other in the midst of our suffering
2406947 we also mourn for their families and the spiritual communities from which they came we pray for the intercession of our mother mary that she may grant the families peace in knowing that their loved ones are now with her son jesus
2406948 obviously it is something serious enough that we are out here four hours later
2406949 this is the kind of stuff you watch on csi
2406950 that i do not however accuse the christians more bitterly than truth compels may be conjectured from hence that the cryers who call men to other mysteries proclaim as follows let him approach whose hands are pure and whose words are wise and again others proclaim let him approach who is pure from all wickedness whose soul is not conscious of any evil and who leads a just and upright life and these things are proclaimed by those who promise a purification from error let us now hear who those are that are called to the christian mysteries whoever is a sinner whoever is unwise whoever is a fool and whoever in short is miserable him the kingdom of god will receive do you not therefore call a sinner an unjust man a thief a housebreaker a wizard one who is sacrilegious and a robber of sepulchres what other persons would the cryer nominate who should call robbers together
2406951 well youre not really supposed to do it that way
2406952 now im in the middle and i just dont know if ill make it any further if the words dont flow when you live in silence any sound is dear but for those who dont take heart because the end is near
2406953 i know that it might make you happy to fill my body full of holes but you know it aint easy being on parole with you baby
2406954 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
2406955 she was a very soft lady who helped a lot of people
2406956 after south vietnam collapsed there was no freedom at all
2406957 before she left on the trip she came to my house and brought me cupcakes
2406958 i told her to keep them for the journey but she had made them for the festival and wanted me to have some
2406959 he never hurt nobody he was so happy all the time you could just feel the energy
2406960 once the children left and the house was silent she found solace in altering clothes
2406961 a young beautiful girl from our lady of lavang church
2406962 said nassar who worked as a volunteer at barc and followed it closely
2406963 that was a special time everyone in the town was on cloud nine and to repeat that feeling would be remarkable
2406964 our goal is to make teams work to get downfield against us
2406965 far too often last season opponents were able to score quickly against us we had a great spring in the system and the guys feel good about it
2406966 the uca game was probably the worst example of how we played defensively
2406967 no question that day was where we hit rock bottom as a team
2406968 it is my desire and my will to be bonded in blood to sinji
2406969 it is my desire and my will to be bonded in blood to tristan
2406970 it was by chance that i first met you and throughout the past two years our paths have separated only to cross over and over again call it fate call it destiny call it the dehara kicking us in the butts and telling us to get with the program i believe in my heart that this bloodbonding that you and i were meant to be and so without further ado i pledge these vows to you
2406971 it was beautiful what i saw congrats and soo you all later
2406972 son cosas del futbol tampoco ramos los mejores el torneo pasado ni ahora somos los peores estamos tranquilos y estamos bien el equipo est confiado as que santos laguna va a ir por los tres puntos pero sin desesperarnos
2406973 quiz s somos un equipo que arriesga mucho y por ende deja muchos espacios atr s pero creo que no que en particular es la esencia nuestra y no creo que la cambiemos
2406974 si eu comienza a retirar sus fuerzas su eminencia muqtada al sadr disolver el ej rcito del mahdi
2406975 la corriente sadrista siente que estados unidos tiene una intenci n genuina de sacar a sus militares del pa s
2406976 definitivamente s hay inhibici n de inversiones yo creo que s hay gente que piensa dos veces antes de invertir aqu en este pa s si hay este nivel de inseguridad
2406977 otros de los elementos fundamentales del fortalecimiento decidido del trabajo institucional en contra del secuestro considera el cuidadoso an lisis de la din mica y perfiles del tipo delictivo en el pa s m s y mejor coordinaci n de todas las reas que somos competentes en el gobierno federal coordinaci n m s puntual de ministerios p blicos y polic as que en los t rminos del art culo 21 constitucional comparten la responsabilidad de investigar el delito y m s mucho m s atenci n directa a las v ctimas por el propio titular de la pgr todo ello en orden a las instrucciones del presidente de la rep blica felipe calder n
2406978 exigimos a las autoridades realizar investigaciones eficaces que permitan el esclarecimiento del asesinato
2406979 yo espero que el ej rcito mexicano tenga bien calculado el riesgo que se corre de que aqu se resienta un efecto cucaracha de no implementar pronto una estrategia similar a la de lerdo y g mez palacio
2406980 me coment que ya ven an esas fuerzas especiales para durango y que iba tambi n a enviar fuerzas a torre n

2406982 i guess weekly forecast grab the pepto bismol were going to have some fun
2406983 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
2406984 were endeavouring to combine the two phases to try to get them done in this building season weve received assurances from the engineering people and our departmental people that this is possible
2406985 im a little skeptical because of the late start were now into august so im very skeptical if we can do two phases in one this year
2406986 i could go through every adjective i know amazing incredible exciting awesome it still doesnt do it justice
2406987 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing canadian flags canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leafs i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
2406988 the opening ceremonies were incredible all the show was amazing i didnt expect this at all
2406989 ive never seen a stadium that big it was just crazy waving at everybody ill do it again if its possible
2406990 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada
2406991 the energy was extraordinary as we walked into the stadium
2406992 the dancing the music and all the canadian flags gave me goose bumps i was not expecting something like this
2406993 all parties are coming in with a form of carbon tax
2406994 i would encourage all nova scotians to look very carefully at all the federal plans i have come out not in favour of the carbon tax but if you look at federal liberal leader stephane dions blended plan it is probably the fairer of all of them but from a provincial point of view a carbon tax is not the way for us to go
2406995 were in a unique situation in nova scotia where we have a regulated monopoly that provides us energy
2406996 what we should be doing here is focusing on how to build a renewable energy sector in this province one we can build an economy around that can allow us to move away from the fossil fuel pollution that is presently happening
2406997 we have been looking at every seat as if its a seat that is up for grabs and were working very hard building an oganization and recruiting candidates
2406998 we have spent much of our time putting together a platform which we believe is there or getting very close to that well release that as we go forward but now were focusing on candidate recruitment were not looking at seats as if this is a soft seat or this is a sure seat because there is no such thing as a sure seat in politics were just going to try to build a liberal option a forward thinking option one which we feel is good for the future of the province
2406999 what the premier rodney macdonald should be doing is being focused on what his government can do to alleviate the energy issue that is going to be facing us not only this year but well into the future
2407000 how do we build that renewable energy sector how do we make a province that is less reliant on the world market in terms of the price of coal the price of oil how do we do that weve laid out some steps and we think we can do that
2407001 there is a tremendous opportunity here in nova scotia not only to be able to build and capture that energy which provides us with a stable energy cost but it also allows us to build a research and development component here in the province that we can use as an export our knowledge around renewable energies
2407002 i am not satisfied there are exceptional circumstances here requiring the granting of a stay
2407003 mr macintosh is asking this court to impose an adjournment of the inquiry by temporarily granting the same relief that was refused by justice edwards
2407004 nosotros no esperamos que el trato sea rec proco porque es rec proco as es
2407005 en los ltimos a os las relaciones entre china y m xico se encuentran en un excelente estado y se desarrollan cada a o con mucha fluidez
2407006 tenemos entre los dos pa ses unas relaciones estrat gicas tenemos una comisi n binacional que se re ne cada dos a os para tratar los temas importantes
2407007 tenemos una consulta pol tica pero ahora es un di logo estrat gico porque china y m xico son dos pa ses muy importantes y tenemos un lenguaje similar sobre temas importantes de toda la humanidad
2407008 por ello creemos que debemos establecer este sistema de di logo estrat gico para tratar anualmente los temas m s importantes del mundo
2407009 en china hay ferias muy importantes yo sugiero que los empresarios mexicanos participen en este tipo de ferias
2407010 francamente no hay inter s entre los empresarios mexicanos hay muchas quejas pero falta un inter s para conocer y entrar en el mercado chino no existe suficiente inter s
2407011 no la distancia hoy d a no es un problema
2407012 yo no quiero hacer pron sticos pero para un tratado de libre comercio se necesitan cuatro cosas una de las dos partes plantea la propuesta y hasta el momento ninguno de los dos ha planteado la propuesta el estudio de la probabilidad y viabilidad negociaciones y suscripci n
2407013 hemos escuchado que ese se or va a venir lo hemos le do en medios se dice que va a venir a m xico yo leo en las noticias
2407014 yo no intervengo les organizo el viaje las excursiones los hoteles y les muestro los hospitales en los que se pueden operar adem s de presentarles a los m dicos y los resultados han sido siempre positivos
2407015 los tres lo han hecho en hospitales de primer nivel y les ha costado entre 6 mil y 9 mil euros frente a los entre 18 mil y 30 mil que cuesta aqu
2407016 con cirujanos de primer orden y un servicio maravilloso de lujo a precios sin competencia posible
2407017 normalmente no por que la intervenci n se haya hecho mal sino por un control posterior inadecuado
2407018 por eso a veces es mejor estar m s cerca de casa
2407019 no necesitamos en washington otro pol tico que antepone sus intereses personales y pol ticos antes que solucionar los problemas del pa s
2407020 pondr primero siempre siempre siempre a mi pa s lo he hecho desde que ca preso en vietnam y tuve la oportunidad de regresar antes que mis camaradas

2407030 devolvimos el fuego a los tanques que disparaban hacia nosotros
2407031 di logo entre todas las partes que es la nica manera de llegar a una soluci n duradera de la crisis
2407032 hemos movilizado a nuestras fuerzas armadas parte de las cuales avanza hacia la frontera georgiana y tomar all posiciones independientemente de c mo evolucione la situaci n en osetia del sur
2407033 lo que ocurre hoy en osetia del sur ma ana puede ocurrir en abjasia as no podemos seguir
2407034 las fuerzas armadas deber an tumbar ya al gobierno nacional porque no sirve para nada
2407035 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
2407036 lo que vemos en bolivia es que hay mucha dificultad para reconstruir un orden democr tico acatado por todos y lo principal es que se pone siempre en discusi n la autoridad presidencial y el voto mayoritario

2407060 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2407061 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation

2407101 i would not say that the source of violence is the frater nity culture itself there are certain elements within the larger society notably from an older culture the culture of the warlord that have crept into the frat system
2407102 frats are human groups they provide a form of support and a sense of belonging that is natural in any human community setting not just in the universi ty
2407103 provide for 1 stiffer penalties 2 more expansive coverage of the prohibited acts and 3 speedier procedures in the student disciplinary tribunal sdt
2407104 the sdt shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence and may conduct summary proceedings
2407105 the failure of a party or his counsel to attend the hearing on the scheduled date shall not be a ground for postponing the hearing
2407106 in these proceedings you only need the twin requirements of due process notice and hearing there should be a notice that there is a charge against you the exact offense being charged and the opportunity to be heard you are told that on a particu lar day you are supposed to have a hearing if you chose not to be present you are deemed to have waived the right to be present and the hearing of the case will go on this happens even under the present rules
2407107 sobrang mabigat ang mga penalties the rules may even encourage frats to go under ground or refuse to be recognized dahil sa mga penal ties
2407108 going under ground should not deter the university from imposing higher penalties if they go underground they would not get the bene fits of a bona fide student organization eventually that student organization will die
2407109 sure for the first few years they will go underground but i think that a fraternity that does not receive any kind of recognition or acknowledgement by the univer sity will in time die a natural death because part of the mys tique of frats is the social status that is conferred upon them when that status is taken away they lose a vital part of their function

2407469 la violencia amenaza con extenderse a toda la regi n en forma de una guerra tnica y territorial similar a la que sacudi los balcanes
2407470 la tensi n y los ataques se han visto avivados desde la proclamaci n de independencia de kosovo que gener un precedente en todos los movimientos separatistas y puso de manifiesto la incoherencia pol tica de la ue
2407471 bruselas permiti irresponsablemente la secesi n kosovar pero se opone a la independencia de osetia del sur
2407472 los combates en osetia del sur acompa ados de la intoxicaci n informativa marcan un punto de peligrosa inflexi n en el conflicto entre georgia y rusia
2407473 el c ucaso es uno de los patios traseros de rusia con estados como georgia que aspiran a unir su suerte a la de la otan
2407474 un motivo a adido de preocupaci n para una rusia en fase de recuperaci n de su autoestima y de su influencia
2407475 es poco menos que impensable que el ej rcito ruso acepte un desenlace diferente al que conviene a sus intereses
2407476 el choque de intereses y fronteras de rusia y georgia ha desatado un inquietante conflicto armado en la explosiva zona del c ucaso con osetia del sur como campo de batalla
2407477 la reciente independencia de kosovo en los balcanes bajo los auspicios de eeuu y la ue ha dado nuevos argumentos a los separatistas osetios
2407478 a este giro no son ajenos los movimientos de rusia para afianzarse en una regi n de indudable importancia geoestrat gica
2407479 es necesario un alto el fuego y reanudar la negociaci n pol tica sobre el conflicto
2407480 la onu debe mediar para lograr el cese de las hostilidades y un alto el fuego
2407481 la crisis de osetia del sur ya ha ido demasiado lejos
2407482 la exigencia de eeuu y de la ue para que cesen las hostilidades y se reanuden las negociaciones a partir de la asunci n de la integridad territorial de georgia apunta a la nica salida viable para evitar una guerra civil y la conversi n del conflicto en una crisis internacional
2407483 si la grandiosidad es la t nica habitual en las ceremonias de inauguraci n de los juegos ol mpicos pek n ha echado el resto
2407484 los juegos han servido de excusa para ser el trampol n internacional de todo un pa s
2407485 las medidas que pretenden recortar la libertad de expresi n o el derecho a la informaci n retratan a un estado totalitario

2407488 las democracias occidentales deben persuadir a pek n de que tiene que seguir dando pasos en el respeto de los derechos fundamentales si quiere ser una potencia equiparable al resto
2407489 la reaparici n de china en la escena internacional como gran potencia
2407490 estos juegos son el escaparate planetario que resume m s de veinte a os de pol ticas de reformas
2407491 la china que hoy se muestra al mundo es una poderosa maquinaria econ mica con las cuentas bastante saneadas y capaz de asombrar con sus logros
2407492 nunca desarrollar todas sus posibilidades si el r gimen no deja que la sociedad participe democr ticamente en la definici n de su propio futuro
2407493 el verdadero despertar de china ser el de su sociedad cuando la dictadura del partido nico d paso a elecciones libres y pluripartidistas
2407494 sin el sacrifico de los deportistas y el apoyo de gobiernos y patrocinadores no es posible el xito
2407495 hay que fortalecer la estructura deportiva pero la base actual nos sit a ya en el umbral de las potencias
2407496 la fascinaci n que pretende ejercer china sobre quienes asisten a su despegue entre expectantes y temerosos precisa para ser cre ble adem s del atractivo de su evoluci n econ mica y social de avances efectivos en la democratizaci n del estado y en el respeto a las libertades civiles
2407497 la colocaci n ayer de tres peque as bombas en diversos puntos tur sticos del pa s vasco franc s apunta a la estrategia del complejo etarra para trasladar y ampliar su siniestro conflicto hasta la zona que tradicionalmente le hab a servido de refugio

2407500 si zapatero ser recordado por iniciar su primera legislatura por una serie de avances en derechos sociales que nosotros apoyamos sin fisuras esta segunda la ha iniciado empantanado en la crisis econ mica e impulsando medidas claramente de derechas

2407504 over the years community shield matches have been between ourselves chelsea arsenal and liverpool
2407505 this is different it is good for portsmouth and shows the progress they have made
2407506 they are not easy to play against especially at their own ground and when you look at the progression in their team we know it will not be an easy game
2407507 harry brought peter crouch into his squad so you can see the direction of the partnership with defoe

2407509 we are looking at three or four different options in the striking department which i hope will come to a happy conclusion
2407510 therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptising them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you
2407511 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
2407512 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
2407513 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
2407514 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
2407515 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
2407516 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
2407517 el jefe de sector se person el 4 de agosto en el domicilio de mis padres donde me encuentro viviendo y me inform que por orientaci n del r gimen deb a de incorporarme a trabajar de lo contrario me ser a aplicada la ley conocida por peligrosidad social que era de su conocimiento todo lo sucedido en el 2005 lo del desalojo y la expulsi n de mi trabajo ante esto yo le contest que estaba dispuesto a trabajar que me dieran el puesto que ocupaba como entrenador de boxeo que yo era un profesional y que el gobierno me hab a expulsado de all por discrepar no trabajar en la agricultura porque yo amo mi profesi n como entrenador dicho agente me orient que deb a presentarme en la direcci n municipal del gobierno ante la secretaria que ella me dar a una respuesta

2407519 le ped a la china le dijera esto mismo al jefe de sector para que este viera mi preocupaci n por trabajar y lo cual me es negado

2407524 if we fear public speaking more than death the worst we can expect is to die giving a speech
2407525 better than living with that kind of fear in our professional lives is to master a few easy mind games tricks and skills including realizing that there really is no such a thing as public speaking
2407526 you speak every day with friends colleagues and family you have conversations every moment of the day so wash away the fear the next time and lower the public speaking terror alert by saying its just speaking when you step on stage
2407527 sure its a mind game but so are the tricks your mind plays on you that cause you to be afraid so play the game to win use those tricks to serve yourself rather than undermine yourself

2407537 overall data show that while childrens kiswahili language competencies are generally well developed english language competencies are poorly developed in both primary and secondary school students
2407538 the ability to stand up and speak comfortably before audiences
2407539 to banish the fear of speaking to audiences we need to realize one simple truth theres no such thing as public speaking only speaking having a conversation i always tell my executive clients that you can only speak to one person at a time this approach downsizes the threat with this attitude the terror alert drops down to green and the fear vanishes
2407540 not many people associate public speaking with a sense of joy thats unfortunate the very best speakers truly enjoy the experience they thrive on having the opportunity to share their ideas and messages with a live audience by connecting and conversing with one person at a time its all about how you visualize and define it going in to tap into the joy of speaking we have to define it differently
2407541 participants learn a simple three step process that moves them from stage fright to stage delight
2407542 do you think those professors know more about pornography than you
2407543 why of course the people dont want war but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger
2407544 as we speak the faith food pantry is providing food for hundreds of people who can no longer afford to feed their families
2407545 gas prices have more than doubled since my opponent took office less than four years ago melissa bean has voted repeatedly against increasing american production and creating american jobs she just cast the deciding vote to let congress take an undeserved five week vacation one which many americans cannot afford due to washingtons inaction the american people need proactive leadership in washington that will stand up for them
2407546 changing climate changing health patterns what will it take to predict and protect
2407547 halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015
2407548 a green job has to do something useful for people and it has to be helpful to or at least not damaging to the environment
2407549 if global warming is to be slowed it will take wholesale change in how electricity is generated how people travel and how they heat and cool their houses that means installing hundreds of millions of solar panels building thousands of wind farms and geothermal plants engineering new ways to derive energy from renewable sources and weatherizing millions of homes green companies are rapidly hiring new workers and indications are they will continue

2407581 the key for fannie and freddie both and also for banks is do they have the capital to get through the next year or so
2407582 so if they can hold if they are not taken under by a wave of defaults now itll be a good business two years out it looks like they can but there are a lot of negatives out there too
2407583 the housing crisis that we all observe as we drive home every single day continues to strain our results and our capital
2407584 while we expect that 2008 will be our peak year for credit related expenses the total amount of credit related expenses will be significant in 2009
2407585 none of the plans that weve advanced contemplate access to any treasury line weve not asked them and they have not offered
2407586 i dont think its by any means inevitable that they will go insolvent but after the legislation we dont know what the capital will be
2407587 we are no longer investors in fannie mae and freddie mac
2407588 if a guy dies with the most toys hes still dead
2407589 i would rather not have been in the position of asking for extraordinary authorities to support the gses

2407591 the danger is that you end up looking completely out of touch
2407592 are simply an effort to patch things over to avoid a complete collapse but believe me they are by no means a policy solution because we havent addressed the underlying causes
2407593 one could argue that the helping hand of government may set us up for bigger problems down the road
2407594 to a much greater extent than usual its going to be important for the incoming administration to identify their treasury secretary early
2407595 i believe there is no higher service from government from society from journalism than the protection and upbuilding of the savings of the people
2407596 the unusual method employed by mr bancroft probably was responsible for the delay

2407724 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2407725 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2407726 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything

2407749 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank

2407851 ertinya doa tidak akan ditolak di antara adzan dan iqamah
2407852 ertinya adapun pada waktu sujud maka bersungguh sungguhl ah berdoa keraan saat itu sangat tepat untuk dikabulkan

2407857 hai manusia makanlah dari apa apa yang ada di bumi ini yang halal dan baik dan jangan kamu mengikuti jejak syaitan karena sesungguhnya syaitan itu musuh yang terang terangan bagi kamu
2407858 hai orang orang yang beriman makanlah yang baik baik dari apa apa yang telah kami berikan kepadamu serta bersyukurlah kepada allah kalau betul betul kamu berbakti kepadanya allah hanya mengharamkan kepadamu bangkai darah daging babi dan binatang yang disembelih bukan karena allah maka barangsiapa dalam keadaan terpaksa dengan tidak sengaja dan tidak melewati batas maka tidaklah berdosa baginya karena sesungguhnya allah maha pengampun dan maha belas kasih
2407859 makanlah rezeki yang telah allah keluarkan untuk kamu itu berilah aku kalau kamu ada sisa lantas salah seorang diantara mereka ada yang memberinya sedikit kemudian nabi memakannya
2407860 dialah zat yang memudahkan laut supaya kamu makan daripadanya daging yang lembut
2407861 dihalalkan buat kamu binatang buronan laut dan makanannya sebagai perbekalan buat kamu dan untuk orang orang yang belayar
2407862 emm tak ingat la ustaz kenapa pulak bagaimana soalan saya tadi
2407863 cuba dr bayangkan kalau jarak antara matahari dan bumi ini tiba tiba berubah jadi seinchi rapat apa agaknya akan jadi kat kita
2407864 rasanya jika ikut teorinya mesti hancur lebur dan cair penduduk bumi kot ustaz
2407865 jadinya dr setuju tak kalau saya kata bahawa allah swt begitu mahir dan amat tepat dalam seluruh urusannya jika tidak sudah tentu kita tak boleh hidup di dunia ni bumi asyik berlaga siang malam tak tentu hala dan tumbuhan semuanya kelam kabut tumbuhnya
2407866 benar ustaz saya amat bersetuju tentang allah maha mengetahui dan berkuasa
2407867 jika demikian mengapa dr boleh timbul rasa sangsi tentang keadilan dan kebijaksanaan allah dalam mengarahkan wanita menutup aurat begini dan lelaki begitu
2407868 hmmm ye tak ye jugak ustaz kan betul betul tak patut saya rasa begitu astahgfirullahah azim
2407869 eeee budak ni tak reti ke benda benda ni kotor
2407870 tempik seorang ibu kepada anaknya kerana memasukkan dalam mulutnya kotoran di lantai dapur rumahnya
2407871 sesungguhnya allah telah memfardhukan pelbagai perkaar wajib maka janganlah kamu mengabaikannya dan telah menetapkan had bagi beberapa keharusan maka janganlah kamu melewatinya dan juga telah mengharamkan beberapa perkara maka janganlah kamu mencerobihinya dan juga telah mendiamkan hukum bagi sesuatu perkara sebagai rahmat kemudahan buat kamu dan bukan kerana terlupa maka janganlah kamu menyusahkan dirimu dengan mencari hukumannya
2407872 tapi ustaz orang lelaki mudah le dapat tutup aurat dengan sempurna sebab depa senang sikir benor auratnya
2407873 jika puan rasa susah tapi buat juga kerana allah lagi banyak pahala puan dapat untung orang perempuan tutup je aurat terus dapat pahala setiap saat berganda dari pahala orang lelaki kerana mereka tidak berapa sukar
2407874 sesungguhnya bagi kamu ganjaran pahala berdasarkan kepada kadar keletihan dan belanja ikhlas kamu
2407875 sesungguhnya ganjaran pahalamu wahai aisyah ketika umrahmu ini adalah berdasarkan kadar kesukaran dan wang yang dibelanjakan
2407876 zahir hadith ini menunjukkan ganjaran dan pahala dalam ibadah akan bertambah dengan bertambahnya keletihan dan belanja yang dikeluarkan
2407877 habis ustaz nak orang perempuan duk rumah je la ni
2407878 begini saya kata ikut hukum asal yang allah letak memang begitu cuba bayangkan betapa sukarnya wanita bekerja hari ini untuk melaksanakan tugasnya dalam keadaan senggugut sakit perut mengandung dan bersalin sekiranya ia telah menopos pula sukarnya tiba tiba perlu ke sana sini seorang diri bermesyuarat bersama lelaki berdua duaan dan sebagainya
2407879 mereka sepatutnya lebih dimuliakan dengan diberi kerehatan cukup di rumah sambil membina pimpinan dan generasi soleh masa depan iaitu anaknya dan keluarganya
2407880 bagi seorang wanita untuk menunaikan solat di tempat tidurnya adalah lebih baik dari menunaikannya di biliknya dan menunaikannya di biliknya lebih baik dari menunaikannya di rumahnya dan menunaikannya di rumahnya lebih baik dari menunaikannya di masjid
2407881 baiklah tapi ada beberapa displin hukum bagi wanita diluar rumah tanggung jawab asas terhadap suami yang tidak berubah sehingga kiamat sudah dijaga
2407882 habis anak perempuan kenapa boleh berjaya pulak sedangkan dari rumah yang sama
2407883 mana mana wanita yang berwangian dan kemudian lalu dikhalayak lelaki bagi menarik lelaki dengan wangiannya maka ia adalah seperti wanita penzina dan setiap mata lelaki yang tertarik lalu memandangkan adalah mata yang berzina
2407884 apa le ustaz ni orang sedang cerita benda besar iaitu bab sumbangan wanita tiba tiba dia sibuk ulas benda benda kecil tentang aurat pula tak berkembang pemikiran langsung

2407925 were content with the public disclosure frankly were happy to have it out there
2407926 i t would be difficult to describe his near fatal shooting while wounded and hors de combat as anything other than something very akin to an attempted summary execution
2407927 this could explain the governments decision to hold him responsible for tossing a hand grenade despite the absence of any eyewitness to the incident and despite the fact that at least one other person was alive and fighting when sergeant speer was mortally wounded
2407928 i look back to the two million people who died in the war that lasted 21 years and its an exciting day
2407929 just over five years ago he was in a refugee camp
2407930 to talk about him today as a flag bearer of the united states is just exciting
2407931 a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
2407932 we have kept this within our family since that time
2407933 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2407934 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2407935 wah wah nomor bagus gus saridin gampang diingat nanti saya kerahkan keluarga ane untuk mencoblos no 35 partai ente namanya masih jil jaringan orang islam linglung kan
2407936 dasar sudah termakan sinetron gak pernah lihat berita atau baca koran
2407937 lah gimana ceritanya gus saridin kurang dana kan banyak tuh dana bersliweran di luar negeri yang bisa diraup dengan gampang cukup
2407938 cukup ente samakan partai jil saya dengan jin atau jip atau je je lainnya no way
2407939 sorry sorry gus saridin bukan maksud ane menyinggung perasaan ente ngomong ngomong nanti kalau ke jakarta gus saridin bisa naik bus jemputan
2407940 he gus saridin jangan salah sangka bus jemputan saya sebentar lagi mau diperbaiki mungkin butuh waktu 2 bulanan
2407941 oh ya tapi apa yang diperbaiki body nya diganti total agar lebih sejuk atau hanya sekedar dielus elus dempul sana dempul sini kalau yang terakhir ini ya gak ngepek akan lebih bagus kalau ada ac nya ya paling tidak body nya diganti dengan yang lebih tinggi sehingga terkesan luas kaca jendela ditaruh di atas sehingga bagi yang duduk di dekat jendela nanti tidak membuka jendela hanya untuk dihirup sendiri dan tidak kuatir masuk angin dan tidak kalah pentingnya dibuatkan lubang angin di atap bus biar sirkulasi udara lebih nyaman usulkan ke pengurus agar berkoordinasi dengan pihak kendaraan bisa ndak diusulkan seperti itu takutnya nanti pada over estimate dikira diganti body n penampilan tak tahunya hanya diganti bannya dengan ban sepeda kan repot
2407942 o itu masalahnya saya sedikit usul mungkin sudah banyak yang usul cobalah di data siapa yang akan ikut bus terus dan siapa yang memilih kendaraan lain selama 2 bulan ke depan jika masih terlalu banyak yang memilih naik bus jemputan kan bisa dipakai skala prioritas misalnya untuk ibu2 dulu baru yang sudah sangat senior kemudian yang agak tua kemudian yang agak muda dst pasti tidak memuaskan semua orang tapi dengan didasari semangat solidaritas ane kira tidak menjadi persoalan untuk yang tidak ikut bus jemputan sama sekali selama masa pebaikan ya mungkin bisa dibebaskan dari iuran jika kondisi kas memungkinkan
2407943 baik gus saridin terima kasih atas sarannya tapi ngomong2 meski gak lolos partainya tahun depan gak ngomporin golput kan
2407944 emangnya ane ini mirip orang di partai yang sudah ada jangan banding2 kan
2407945 lho kok naik kereta lagi bukannya bus sudah dibelikan aki baru
2407946 gak tahulah katanya sekarang aki aki nya yang mejen ngadat kayak petasan gak bunyi ketika disulut
2407947 lebih heboh lagi kalau sekarang busnya sedang muksa hilang tanpa bekas biasanya bertapa
2407948 he he he kalau ente sedang dongkol kelihatan jeleknya gini aja saya usul bagaimana kalau sopirnya diganti saja biar gak timbul fitnah kita gak dosa dia enjoy dengan mainannya kan enak
2407949 ya itu mungkin usul yang paling rasional tapi ngomong2 kenapa gus saridin naik ka pakuan biasanya naik ka ekonomi di ruang masinis
2407950 namun demikian kita perlu berkorban dan bersabar sementara bis 41 diperbaiki mungkin nanti akan kita perlakukan ikut bis secara bergantian diantara kita
2407951 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2407952 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2407953 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2407954 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2407955 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2407956 this is the toughest course i have ever seen at a tournament event
2407957 expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment
2407958 school boards may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means including strategic site selection of new schools drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods allocating resources for special programs recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion and tracking enrollments performance and other statistics by race these mechanisms are race conscious but do not lead to different treatment based on a classification that tells each student he or she is to be defined by race so it is unlikely any of them would demand strict scrutiny to be found permissible
2407959 selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of not merely in spite of its adverse effects upon an identifiable group
2407960 if the constitutional conception of equal protection of the laws means anything it must at the very least mean that a bare
2407961 proof of an invidious motive by itself strips a law of its presumptive legitimacy once the plaintiff has shown a discriminatory purpose the burden shifts to the defendants to prove that the law would have been enacted even without that purpose
2407962 if our history has taught us anything it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories
2407963 as a severe brake upon federal and state regulation of business and property
2407964 it is easy to take liberty for granted when you have never had it taken from you
2407965 one of the reasons why i had recommended or pressed the issue of trying to get the trials moved to the united states was because i felt that no matter how transparent no matter how open the trials if they took place at guantanamo in the international community they would lack credibility
2407966 the most important questions this committee should be asking about the current policy are does it serve the overall objective does it comport with our laws and values guantanamo policy fails all those tests
2407967 we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home
2407968 create table tags id integer primary key autoincrement not null tagname varchar unique not null

2407973 select filename from cache results join cache queries on cache queries
2407974 nothing in this joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the war powers resolution
2407975 the whole powers of war being by the constitution of the united states vested in congress the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as our guides
2407976 vigilantly protect our legislative preogatives from encroachment by the judiciary
2407977 truman committee to seek out corruption and waste for the betterment of the war effort as a whole
2407978 almost all aspects of the war program except strategy and tactics
2407979 blocked from consideration by gop leaders for more than a year
2407980 constitutional responsibility to ensure comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of united states government funds
2407981 theres never been a time in our countrys history when weve shoved so much money out the door with so little oversight
2407982 ive met the girls a couple of times but i havent met the guys its all about getting to the practice venue and saying hello showing your face and if they want to use us fine if they dont likewise its nice just to come along and show your support at the training sessions
2407983 its sensational mate its a real privilege to be here to get up so close and personal with so many sports and training venues and to see what they have put into their sports i feel really honoured to be here
2407984 ive met most of them over the past six to nine months just to try and build up a relationship and if any of the athletes need some words from us the three mentors i guess our role is to pass on our own experiences in sport
2407985 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
2407986 the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
2407987 vice president dick cheney and his inner circle long have insisted
2407988 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2407989 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2407990 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2407991 the calvo family members were the apparent victims of a local drug ring
2407992 i called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the familys beloved dogs
2407993 the deputies opened fire and executed our dogs the very second they broke down our front door
2407994 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2407995 as one of the first web hosts to offer microsoft windows server 2008 earlier this year crystaltech has had the opportunity to test hyper v in a dedicated environment for several months now the fact that we are able to provide a vps solution so quickly after hyper v was released to the market illustrates our commitment to offering the latest cutting edge technologies to our customer base
2407996 as a middle ground between shared and dedicated services the appeal and demand for virtual private servers is growing among businesses and developers who require more control over their web environments but dont necessarily need the entire resources of a dedicated server
2407997 incluye limpieza de componentes internos de la pc respaldo de datos instalaci n del nuevo sistema instalaci n de programas como office java flash placer instalaci n de impresora c mara etc
2407998 si instalaste aba y quieres compartir con tus vecinos para pagar menos pues te hacemos todo lo referente a la instalaci n
2407999 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2408000 if people were looking for this deal to turn things around for the market it certainly hasnt done that yet
2408001 i think its the meanest thing that could ever have happened to her
2408002 adding garbage to garbage i just dont understand how someone who professes to love somebody can do this
2408003 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2408004 you know what shes still really bright and i still have a lot of respect for her
2408005 my heart goes out to her she shouldnt have to deal with this after all she has been through from the loss of her son wade to her brave battle against cancer
2408006 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2408007 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2408008 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2408009 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2408010 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2408011 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2408012 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2408013 i was there from a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2408014 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2408015 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2408016 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2408017 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2408018 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2408019 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2408020 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2408021 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2408022 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2408023 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2408024 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention
2408025 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2408026 i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2408027 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path
2408028 who will take the final steps to 1600 pennsylvania avenue
2408029 a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular hard working people
2408030 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2408031 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2408032 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2408033 really the last three weeks and this whole off season has been bizarre or whatever you want to call it but it is what it is
2408034 i am a member of the jets i am excited about it im excited about the opportunity did i ever think this scenario would present itself no am i excited about the opportunity yes
2408035 we have not been able to bring in barry but it is not a question of money i dont know what it is
2408036 we need to improve if we can and i think we need another player because clearly we have problems on the left i have sold john arne riise harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebasti n leto didnt get a work permit so we need another left sided player i cannot say now who that will be but barry can fill that position and play in others too the rules will say we need four english and four associated players and barry is english who can play in three different positions but i cannot say any more all i can say is i will try my best but i dont know too much why we havent signed barry
2408037 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it
2408038 il opte pour la nationalit allemande pour dit il ne pas tre soumis au service militaire en france

2408040 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang
2408041 if a site allows any kind of links at all then what a user does after they follow that link is really out of control of the social networking site
2408042 they can keep blocking the links to malicious sites as they pop up and they can try to educate their user base but thats about it facebook is likely at the mercy of the security of each users home computer
2408043 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water
2408044 and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2408045 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2408046 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
2408047 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
2408048 weve been talking to granty and are expecting him to come in and sign for us
2408049 we obviously had him with us on loan towards the end of last season so we know what hes about and its a good signing for us
2408050 he can play in a couple of positions as well which helps when you only have a small squad like we do
2408051 i really wanted to and still want to leave but my club which didnt want to let me go in the first place is doing everything possible so that it doesnt happen
2408052 i can only say that if i go abroad i will earn less than i get in russia
2408053 first of all we all want him to stay at zenit but in general of course a good move could be a step forward in his career andrei has been playing for zenit for seven years
2408054 in a unique gesture corporate houses will run to contribute for the cause of the underprivileged children
2408055 part of the proceeds of the event will go to dream a dream a local ngo working for underprivileged children
2408056 when we first approached the corporate houses we were a bit sceptical about their reaction but we were surprised to see their enthusiasm
2408057 i am glad that i will be contributing in my own small way for the cause of needy children
2408058 we fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 00 p m and 11 39 p m friday which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium
2408059 a small bubble in the rain cloud would have triggered rainfall
2408060 well i was watching you to make sure you were doing your job
2408061 im sorry i must have slipped out of robot mode
2408062 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games tonight that dream came true
2408063 why are so many people in the west so eager to jump on this moral bandwagon and punch china in the face without the basic understanding of the country its culture and its people
2408064 a real china is ready to show itself to the world
2408065 the olympic games is an arena from where china will make more changes in itself keeping to its reform opening wider to the outside world and playing the role of a responsible shareholder on the world stage
2408066 although there is a need for further research our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this colour bias may be a problem
2408067 given that lincoln is based in the philadelphia region we are committed to growing and strengthening our planner presence here matts talent and dedication make him an ideal person to help us achieve that goal
2408068 matts expertise will enable lincoln to cultivate its reputation as a company that not only builds independent brands for financial advisors but does so while maintaining full service support and resources not found in other platforms
2408069 okay class take out your books and turn to page 138
2408070 lets discuss the finer points of solipsism and existentialism and how they form the basis of the postmodern relativist worldview
2408071 im using cheap earth abundant materials that you can mass manufacture as long as you can charge the surface you can create the catalyst and it doesnt get any cheaper than that
2408072 you could imagine during the day you have a photovoltaic cell you take some of that electricity and use it in your house then take the other part of that electricity for my catalyst feed the catalyst water and you get hydrogen and oxygen
2408073 so ive made your house a gas station and a power station its all enabled because we can use light plus water to make a chemical fuel which is hydrogen and oxygen
2408074 in the next 50 years the world needs 16 terawatts by the end of the century well need around 30

2408174 ampunilah kami ya tuhan kami dan kepada engkaulah tempat kembali
2408175 iman adalah kamu beriman pada allah malaikat kitabnya bertemu dengannya para rasul dan beriman kepada hari kebangkitan
2408176 bahwa iman kepada malaikat adalah pokok iman kepada wahyu karena malaikat penyampai wahyu adalah roh yang berakal yang memiliki ilmu yang luas dengan izin allah malaikat menyampaikan wahyu kepada roh nabi sebagai pokok agama karenanya penyebutan iman kepada malaikat didahulukan atas penyebutan iman kepada kitab dan para nabi sebab merekalah yang datang kepada para nabi membawa kitab jadi mengingkari malaikat berarti mengingkari wahyu kenabian dan ruh dan itu berarti mengingkari hari akhir orang yang mengingkari hari akhir tujuan utama hidupnya adalah kenikmatan dunia syahwat dan segala tuntutannya hal ini adalah sumber kesengsaraan di dunia sebelum di akhirat
2408177 malaikat diciptkan dari cahaya jin diciptakan dari api dan adam diciptakan dari apa yang telah diceritakan pada kamu tanah
2408178 mengapakah tidak diturunkan kepada kita malaikat atau mengapa kita tidak melihat tuhan kita
2408179 allah telah menjadikan permintaan manusia akan diturunkannya malaikat sebagai suatu masalah besar yang dianggap sebagai kesombongan dan melampaui batas dan allah menjelaskan kepada kita bahwa kita sebagai manusia tidak akan pernah dapat melihat malaikat sampai hari kiamat
2408180 aku orang pertama dari umat ini yang bertanya kepada rasulullah tentang ayat di atas maka rasulullah saw menjawab sesungguhnya dia adalah malaikat jibril rasul tidak melihatnya dalam bentuk aslinya kecuali dua kali rasul melihatnya pertama kali di saat malaikat jibril turun ke bumi dan sayapnya menutupi antara langit dan bumi
2408181 jika kamu mendengar suara ayam jago maka mintalah kepada allah sebagian dari karunianya karena ayam jago itu dapat melihat malaikat dan bila kamu mendengar suara ringkik keledai maka berlindunglah kepada allah dari setan karena ia melihat setan
2408182 ketika kami sedang duduk di sisi rasulullah tiba tiba muncul seorang laki laki dengan mengenakan pakaian yang sangat putih dan rambut yang sangat hitam lalu menyandarkan kedua lututnya pada kedua lutut rasulullah dan meletakkan kedua telapak tangannya di atas paha rasul dan ia berkata wahai muhamad beritahu saya tentang islam
2408183 dia adalah malaikat jibril yang telah datang kepadamu mengajarkan kami tentang agamamu
2408184 dan malaikat malaikat berada di penjuru penjuru langit dan pada hari itu delapan malaikat menjunjung arsy tuhanmu di atas kepala mereka
2408185 dan ditiuplah sangkakala maka matilah siapa yang di langit dan di bumi kecuali siapa yang dikehendaki allah kemudian ditiup sangkakala itu sekali lagi maka tiba tiba mereka berdiri menunggu putusannya masing masing
2408186 maka tatkala datang azab kami kami jadikan negeri kaum luth itu yang di atas ke bawah kami balikkan red dan kami hujani mereka dengan batu dari tanah yang terbakar dengan bertubi tubi
2408187 malaikat malaikat dan jibril naik menghadap kepada tuhan dalam sehari yang kadarnya lima puluh ribu tahun
2408188 tidak mendurhakai allah terhadap apa yang diperintahkan nya kepada mereka dan selalu mengerjakan apa yang diperintahkan
2408189 mereka itu tidak mendahului nya dengan perkataan dan mereka mengerjakan perintah perintahnya
2408190 dan kepunyaan nyalah segala yang di langit dan di bumi dan malaikat malaikat yang di sisi nya mereka tiada mempunyai rasa angkuh untuk menyembah nya dan tiada pula merasa letih
2408191 ucapan yang paling afdlal adalah kata kata yang telah dipilihkan oleh allah untuk malaikat yaitu dan abdurrahman bin qarth bahwa rasulullah saw pada malam isra dan miraj mendengar suara tasbih di langit yang paling atas
2408192 sesungguhnya aku mendengar hentakan langit tidak ada satu jengkal pun bagian langit yang terhentak melainkan di atasnya malaikat sedaang sujud atau sedang berdiri
2408193 mereka takut kepada tuhan mereka yang di atas mereka dan melaksanakan apa yang diperintahkan kepada mereka
2408194 jika mereka menyombongkan diri maka mereka malaikat yang di sisi tuhanmu bertasbih kepada nya di malam dan siang hari sedang mereka tidak jemu jemu
2408195 mengapa engkau hendak menjadikan khalifah di bumi itu orang yang akan membuat kerusakan padanya dan menumpahkan darah
2408196 padahal kami senantiasa bertasbih dengan memuji engkau dan mensucikan engkau
2408197 mengapa engkau hendak menjadikan khalifah di bumi itu orang yang akan membuat kerusakan padanya dan menumpahkan darah padahal kami senantiasa bertasbih dengan memuji engkau dan mensucikan engkau
2408198 adalah dalil yang mencela para malaikat bukannya sebagai dalil tentang bebasnya malaikat dari kesalahan hal itu ditinjau dari beberapa sisi
2408199 mengapa engkau hendak menjadikan khalifah di bumi itu orang yang akan membuat kerusakan padanya dan menumpahkan darah
2408200 padahal kami senantiasa bertasbih dengan memuji engkau dan mensucikan engkau
2408201 maha suci engkau tidak ada yang kami ketahui selain dari apa yang telah engkau ajarkan kepada kami sesungguhnya engkaulah yang maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana
2408202 sebutkanlah kepada ku nama benda benda itu jika kamu memang benar orang orang yang benar
2408203 bukankah sudah ku katakan kepadamu bahwa sesungguhnya aku mengetahui rahasia langit dan bumi dan mengetahui apa yang kamu lahirkan dan apa yang kamu sembunyikan

2408233 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games tonight that dream came true

2408237 fencing and other safety measures are recommended by the u s consumer product safety commission for large inflatables as well as conventional in ground and above ground pools
2408238 safety standards vary widely and their enforcement is far from vigorous in some communities
2408239 capt craig evans of the germantown police department said his department lacks the resources to patrol neighborhoods for compliance with a village ordinance that requires fencing around any pool with water deeper than 18 inches
2408240 the village is considering an ordinance that would allow police to issue tickets to students if they violate rules about the use of cell phones and other electronic devices in schools
2408241 police chief peter hoell said he thinks the ordinance would be used only a couple of times a year
2408242 the village board is expected to approve the ordinance aug 18 given that is was unanimously recommended this week by the boards public safety committee

2408310 obamas resume reads like he never made a mistake in his brief life by contrast mccains biography is replete with failed attempts and verbal miscues of one kind or another
2408311 to listen to barack obama attempt to explain his views on iraq and the so called surge is becoming for those of us who have followed his responses over the last 18 months something of a spectacle
2408312 with every effort it seems he is compounding his mistakes in judgment with intellectually dishonest answers ones which melt away under even minimal scrutiny
2408313 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think itll do the reverse

2408450 when i helped the panorama programme several years ago i presented evidence to the chief rabbi and the beth din i have been in touch with rabbinical authorities all over the world there is not one legitimate orthodox authority that has anything good to say about them
2408451 on the contrary the alarm bells have been sounded in many communities to the dangers
2408452 there is always that fear that young jewish people who are na ve will get caught up
2408453 because i felt the work of sfk had been grossly misrepresented in a way that constitutes lashon hara evil speech
2408454 for about 40 minutes for the most part they talked to us and we listened i was there as an observer as the chief rabbi had two of his staff there
2408455 any organisation whose aim is to enhance childrens lives will always have my support but any organisation that is so closely linked to the kabbalah centre i would treat with the greatest reservation sfks founder is karen berg the wife of the head of the kabbalah centre in america anything coming from there in a different package will always be suspect
2408456 recent comments about sfk sadly made by rabbis displayed absolute ignorance as to what we do in contrast to the extremely positive references sfk receives from schools children and parents who have direct experience of sfk
2408457 i do not represent the kabbalah centre but i am a student there and i am shocked and saddened by how the centre is often portrayed my experience of the kabbalah centre has been exclusively positive as an educated person with a background in journalism i am not na ve or uncritical i have only seen in the behaviour and attitudes of the centres staff kindness a genuine desire to help others improve their lives and a commitment to study and personal growth
2408458 i get surprised by the venom that i hear expressed about kabbalah i think part of it is madonna envy
2408459 i was appalled at the comments by two rabbis who seem actually keen to disparage the kabbalah centre and sfk despite a lack of experience or understanding of either organisation
2408460 the criticisms made against sfk by jewish religious leaders are based on doctrinal issues that they have with the kabbalah centre and are quite unfair and inaccurate about sfk and i say that as objectively as i can since i am an agnostic who is not a follower of kabbalah
2408461 i also find it particularly sad when sfk is falsely accused of indoctrination by jewish leaders and i know the chief rabbi is caring and tolerant which is why i thought it would be worthwhile for a meeting to take place but of course i was not there since i neither work for sfk nor am a student of kabbalah
2408462 the office of the chief rabbi meets many faith and non faith charities organisations and individuals each year like many others sfk asked if they could meet us to talk about their work the chief rabbi was not present at the meeting

2408546 yo estoy convencido que la ruta de la divisi n o del xodo silencioso o de dar el brinco a otro partido no nos conviene a la izquierda lamentablemente en este des nimo que hay en la base del partido no solamente hay desencanto hay la salida silenciosa de algunos compa eros
2408547 como estamos viendo en acapulco despu s del fraude que hizo zeferino torreblanca galindo gobernador de guerrero para ganar la presidencia municipal hoy m s de la mitad del partido est apoyando al candidato del partido convergencia luis walton
2408548 estamos al borde de perder uno de los municipios m s importantes del pa s por un conflicto interno por no saber procesar adecuadamente nuestros asuntos internos y porque durante a os la impunidad se ha establecido en nuestro partido
2408549 no estamos en el buen camino para cumplir las metas de acceso universal

2408554 you cant do that you cant go around killing people

2408556 no not anymore kid youre like i once was but who i never can be again too much shit has happened for that to be possible
2408557 human versus human is what will make skynet exist our constant fear for each other our continuous need for more and better with less effort is what will create the need for something like skynet our distrust our economies our exploitation of resources our false faith in faulty technology it is all that contributes to the creation of skynet
2408558 dont you think i dont know that do you think i didnt think of that when i was first confronted with my own fate
2408559 but i am not the sick son of a bitch who created skynet i didnt built that fucking computer
2408560 whatever it is that they have done to you fight it
2408561 what if you cant fight it what if it is something so much stronger than you
2408562 no you will not every person has his or her breaking point kid no matter how much of a struggle you put up its inevitable
2408563 you were experimented on made into someone you had never wanted to be it wasnt your fault tyler
2408564 yes it was i missed the signs of the storm that was coming
2408565 so you just gave up and you sold yourself out
2408566 whats there left to sell out when everythings already been taken from you your pride your dignity your feelings and your mind what you have left when thats all gone
2408567 frying your brains kid slowly but gradually taking over your thoughts and emotions if youre not careful
2408568 are you familiar with the concept of electro convulsive therapy of course you are mom worked at pescadero state hospital for a few months
2408569 the popular term for it yes nanoattrioids skynets latest piece of technology to control humans could help me with this
2408570 it was really bad at first my brains felt as if they were literally on fire and maybe they were with the nanoattrioids embedding into it
2408571 thats why you act like one of them isnt it
2408572 i know that you can beat this tyler and with that i know that i can beat it too
2408573 youre still a hero but please dont become the enemy
2408574 whatever you have done to him in the future it has destabilized him
2408575 right technically speaking i am him but i cant measure him hes not only torn apart by the time jump those nanoattrioids have damaged him severely too
2408576 and in the future i will have to do that to you too i dont know if i can
2408577 dont know either but i know that you will have to
2408578 tj sighed before taking a sip from the milk he had poured for himself
2408579 no but i do know that unknowingly youve unleashed a beast in him if i understood and interpreted it correctly these nanoattrioids short circuit his brain sending him into fits of uncontrollable rage he called it electro convulsive therapy shock treatment in other words you could say that he is being tortured from the inside out conditioned into a certain behavior maybe theres something in this time that will help him control that beast
2408580 the other me the future me knew and thought it would help you that if you knew about what silberman had done to me you wouldnt feel so i guess alone
2408581 out of all us actually i think that even cameron did a step back
2408582 im not a nice guy or a hero ill do what i have to do to accomplish my mission
2408583 what humanity i sacrificed that a long time ago and then i see myself in tj and i see how i used to be that i actually cared that i accepted that part of my fate an orphan finding refuge with the connors taught to lead fight and survive destined for greater things just like john was or is when i was tjs age i didnt meet me he shouldnt have met me now it has become another past another future an altered timeline
2408584 hes like you why else would he have jumped in between when you were about to kill derek youre still good tyler except for that scary totally insane side of yours

2408588 no ser a un fracaso no pasar la previa de la champions pero s una decepci n para todo el equipo
2408589 el equipo est muy bien y llegaremos en la condici n ptima para afrontar el partido se ha visto una evoluci n clara desde que empezamos la pretemporada hasta ahora mismo hemos mejorado y a n nos quedan unos d as para trabajar s lo pensando en ese partido
2408590 tienen 20 d as h biles que es aproximadamente un mes y empez a contar el 18 de julio el plazo no ha concluido est n en periodo de solventaci n
2408591 ya despu s se les informar c mo queda su solventaci n cu les quedaron descargadas y cu les no se les avisa ya en este caso no se est dando un segundo plazo s lo se les enviar un reporte final
2408592 cuando se llegue a la resoluci n final entonces el caso ya es p blico y se concluye la auditor a al 100 por ciento
2408593 la informaci n que tenemos nosotros es que es una respuesta a la solicitud que en reiteradas ocasiones ha hecho el ejecutivo del estado al gobierno federal de una mayor presencia y un mayor apoyo sobre todo para mejorar la seguridad p blica
2408594 s lo he escuchado en los medios de comunicaci n que son 500 militares m s los integrantes de la polic a federal lo que s tenemos de informaci n es que es un n mero muy considerable el suficiente para poder darle esa seguridad y esa tranquilidad que requiere la regi n lagunera
2408595 ya ven que tambi n aqu hay un operativo o sea que no s lo es en la laguna ustedes los medios de comunicaci n han visto que hay presencia de la polic a federal y el ej rcito ha estado participando m s en todo lo que es la prevenci n del delito aqu en la capital y en los municipios aleda os
2408596 la comunidad de bonifacio a trav s de su presidenta nos ha denunciado que el lonco agust n ancu n alba est haciendo correr el rumor de que nuestro vocero del comit de defensa del mar boris hualme se ha vendido a la empresa celco por la suma de 300 millones de pesos y que habr a dejado la vocer a de dicho comit
2408597 este n mero incluye a los bur cratas que se retiran y los maestros
2408598 estamos cumpliendo de manera puntual con los pagos quincenales a poco m s de mil 940 pensionados y jubilados en este momento nos preparamos para el cierre del a o
2408599 hemos sostenido una ocupaci n hotelera muy buena entre el 40 y 46 por ciento que es un incremento de a os anteriores hemos estado hasta cinco o seis puntos arriba en determinados meses en algunos otros han sido dos puntos pero no m s abajo
2408600 estos hechos no hacen m s que seguir dando la raz n a los defensores del mar para oponerse a la planta celulosa arauco
2408601 industrias de este tipo celco son las principales fuentes de emisi n de organoclorados como las dioxinas
2408602 pertenece a todos y todas quienes respetan su grandeza por siempre no al ducto al mar
2408603 no habr un monto determinado ya que puede variar es decir depende de la carrera que se desee estudiar por ejemplo una universidad p blica es m s barata que una privada pero con este tipo de esquema las personas no ven truncada su intenci n de terminar una carrera
2408604 en promedio en una universidad p blica pagas alrededor de 40 mil pesos mientras que en una privada 150 mil pesos
2408605 esta situaci n es grav sima dado que se ha forjado una sentencia que no ha sido dictada por la corte de apelaciones y que se ha falsificado
2408606 este tipo de racismo social ambiental y espacial es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
2408607 seguramente los ministros se equivocaron pero apelen a la corte suprema y seguramente all les va a ir bien
2408608 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
2408609 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
2408610 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
2408611 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
2408612 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
2408613 los que tenemos tienda de abarrotes nos estamos viendo afectados en gran medida por el alza de precios la gente est optando por comprar en el mercado porque se ahorra un poco m s
2408614 no es posible que cada semana que surtimos el mandado nos encontramos con que se increment el precio de un alimento ya no nos alcanza para nada ya tenemos que racionar m s nuestras comidas tanto de ingredientes como de porci n no es justo
2408615 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2408616 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2408617 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas

2408637 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

2408640 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2408641 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2408642 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2408643 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2408644 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2408645 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado

2408648 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the
2408649 two or three ounce servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day
2408650 i was average at academics i cleared my class 10 boards with great difficulty mathematics was especially a sore point so i took up commerce with entrepreneurship in 10 2 got out of school and thought now what
2408651 i used to doodle in the back of notebooks at school watching and drawing cartoons are my hobby so in my second year of pursuing a bachelor of delhi university when i took up the year and a half long diploma course in 3d animation and visual effects from maya academy of advanced cinematics maac to satisfy my hobby it did not take me long to shift gears to animation completely
2408652 the starting salary for an animator is rs 20 000 25 000 and with the expertise the income only grows
2408653 animation is now full of potential it is becoming the most in demand specialisation in the industry with creativity and determination one can go a long way
2408654 childhood obesity paves way for fitness instructors to join schools five star hotels are also on the lookout for body conditioning and gym instructors freelancing can pay up to rs 1 000 or more an hour
2408655 its not good income for an independent artiste after teaching and a couple of sponsored performances i earn about rs 25 000 a month which just about covers costs but the creative satisfaction is well worth it
2408656 beyond bias and barriers fulfilling the potential of women in academic science and engineering
2408657 men and women are psychologically different therefore men are better
2408658 yeah ive never felt so talked down to my entire life i hung up the phone and called biology university to accept the deal they offered me why go to engineering university and deal with that crap every day when biology university made it clear that they would encourage my abilities
2408659 i dont know why you need college youll just end up barefoot and pregnant
2408660 maybe being jerks to individuals is a big enough barrier to entry
2408661 our business has been growing at a brisk pace and as a result we were able to complete our funding round in less than 2 months this continued vote of confidence from our investors is truly gratifying
2408662 our work in raising the bar on data quality for sales contacts and the success of our contact trading platform has laid the groundwork for continued growth of the company
2408663 sales people cant waste time chasing down bad leads netprospex is designed to provide both accuracy and transparency to our users displaying the date a contact was last validated and allowing salespeople to sort results by it is the clearest way we can meet our users needs and help them shorten the sales cycle
2408664 the new suite of sales lead tools increases netprospexs value as a time management tool for sales
2408665 the goal of netprospex is to reduce the time sales people spend digging for accurate targeted information so they can spend more time selling which has a direct impact on sales cycles
2408666 our core competency is ensuring data accuracy of user contributed content
2408667 which we achieve through several layers of quality control no one else in the industry is doing this so we can go deeper into mid management and provide a higher level of confidence in our data
2408668 netprospexs deep coverage into mid management level contacts augments our database significantly
2408669 the truth is that sales people care very little about the cost of the leads we generate what they really care about is how many of those leads will actually become viable sales opportunities
2408670 but unless you can spend a half million dollars or so on brand advertising such efforts probably wont move the sales needle much
2408671 review your existing database and identify the most profitable clients or customers create models for the best types to target with one to many marketing programs then acquire a database containing information on these kinds of companies through database marketing services
2408672 inaccurate or incomplete data is a tremendous waste of time and dollars and its hard to keep your team motivated if every lead turns out to be a dead end
2408673 to get into big companies you cant make a 100 cold calls saying the same thing to everyone several years ago corporate decision makers stopped answering their phones and rolled all calls to voicemail the only way to capture the attention of these corporate decision makers was to create a very personalized message based on in depth research in their firm
2408674 for us its all about the value proposition and thats something that is very specific to a prospects title and functional area many times well roll out parallel campaigns targeting both the business and the it side of the same company understanding who we are talking to and presenting a value proposition that appeals specifically to that individual gives us an extra edge
2408675 knowledge of customer preferences behaviors and needs empowers you to plan marketing campaigns faster and execute them more quickly it also displays results faster which allows a campaign to be tweaked once under way on the basis of customer feedback
2408676 explaining a marketing campaigns rate of return can be difficult
2408677 although no system can deliver a perfect analysis integrated crm sfa solutions let marketers examine the efforts made from first contact to the close of an opportunity and attach a price to the process
2408678 no one devises a perfect system from the start your system will never be perfect but it will improve with each marketing effort get started with a plan to review results and tweak as you go
2408679 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
2408680 is there a moral to this tale or has morale been impaled by your wailing and failing to entertain the need to maintain your brain over your asshole you strange little man
2408681 the answer is that you never ever rely on another person for your peace of mind
2408682 our insatiable demand for food must be worn on our bodies often in the form of diabetes as well as obesity overeating makes us miserable and ill but medical advances mean that it takes a long time to kill us off so we keep on eating
2408683 i love chicken rice in singapore and this blog is fantastic
2408684 since you live in gilroy you really ought to read this
2408685 in those early years decisions about gilroy were driven by the concerns of developers who left little space in their plans for business or commerce just lots and lots of houses they created blocks of identical homes because it was more efficient to build with as little variation as possible they built sidewalks on only one side of the streets to save more they happily left space in subdivision for playgrounds and new elementary schools which they thought would help bring in the young families they were targeting but they did not leave space for the parks for older kids or for a high school each builder worked independently so there were no paths connecting any of the subdivisions
2408686 housing prices topped off in the third quarter of 2006 a few months after a homeowner in the northwest quad closed on his house concern about sub prime mortgages which had financed much of gilroys boom began to grow among the countrys bankers and investors and the easy credit that had enabled so many of gilroys new residents to stretch to buy a house suddenly disappeared the city very quickly went from being a sellers market to the opposite builders started offering incentives on their inventory of unsold homes cutting prices by tens of thousands of dollars ad in some cases auctioning off unsold houses to the highest bidder the oversupply meant that homeowner in the northwest quad s house depreciated every month

2408690 the united states has a system of taxation by confession
2408691 the gamblers guide to taxes how to keep more of what you win
2408692 people expect more from me after my great last five years but i hope i can still save this season with either this or the u s open
2408693 right now the focus is on the olympic games not the rankings
2408694 winning wimbledon i was only a few points from that that hurt but im over that and looking forward now anything that comes now the olympic games or the u s open would help my confidence a lot
2408695 rafa has done very well in the last year or so to become the no 1 in the world but thats not my focus right now
2408696 before the u s open maybe there will be more talk but were a few days ahead of the olympic games where i hope i can do well
2408697 until the rankings change on the computer i do yeah
2408698 i go down once in a while to see the other swiss athletes and get the olympic feel i was there the other day and its not possible really theres so many athletes who want pictures i dont mind it but every day for i dont know how long its not the ideal preparation to try and win the gold medal
2408699 i went through it in sydney and athens i had those great experiences and i know what the olympic games are all about
2408700 now i can get away from it all and really prepare the perfect way thats what im trying to do
2408701 i dont think it really matters were all chasing the same thing an olympic gold and not money
2408702 its one of my dreams to do very well in the olympic games
2408703 carrying the flag is one of those moments you only dream about walking into the stadium with the swiss flag the stadium the biggest ive ever been in i enjoyed it a lot
2408704 this will probably be my most unique unless i have a baby on my birthday but thats not planned yet
2408705 itll be very special im thrilled its on the opening ceremony that i get to carry the flag for switzerland the whole combination is really really nice

2408713 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2408714 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2408715 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2408716 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2408717 this is the toughest course i have ever seen at a tournament event
2408718 instead of driving me home he starts trying to grope me i got mad and pushed him away then he has the balls to ask me to suck his cock right there in the car he starts unzipping his fucking pants god i cant believe it what an asshole

2408738 the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011
2408739 obama has stated repeatedly that his plan would increase taxes only for those making more than 250 000 per year
2408740 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that sen mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president

2408753 i would therefore initiate teachers into the observation of the most simple forms of living things which all those aids which science gives i would make them microscopists i would give them a knowledge of the cultivation of plants and train them to observe their physiology i would direct their observation to insects and would make them study the general laws of biology and i would not have them concerned with theory alone but would encourage them to work independently in laboratories and in the bosom of free nature
2408754 how often is the soul of man especially in childhood deprived because he is not allowed to come in contact with nature
2408755 kids from the ages of 8 to 18 spend about six hours a day plugged into tvs computers video games and other media
2408756 but if for the physical life it is necessary to have the child exposed to the vivifying forces of nature it is also necessary for his psychical life to place the soul of the child in contact with creation

2408760 these people allegedly hacked into the wireless network used by tjx in stores and installed programmes on the network that enabled them to scan or sniff the network traffic going in and out of the company
2408761 gradually they set up their own messaging system within the network similar to a legitimate intranet this case shows that tjxs wireless network was not very secure and it wasnt monitoring strange traffic any company that takes security seriously would have its network secure and monitor constantly for suspicious activity
2408762 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
2408763 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated computer hackers
2408764 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain

2408766 after all air pollution was a major concern in los angeles 24 years ago
2408767 though few now seem to recall the dramatic scene at the end of the womens marathon when the swiss competitor was seen staggering and stumbling from exhaustion the heat and perhaps the effects of air pollution
2408768 air quality was also an issue for subsequent olympic games in barcelona atlanta seoul and athens
2408769 without doubt beijing is facing a huge challenge there are real and understandable concerns for the health of competitors especially those in endurance and long distance events but the current frenzied focus is marked by considerable amnesia
2408770 the debate about the beijing games deserves more fair play
2408771 then there is the attention to eco detail at the olympic venues themselves including the 400 000 square meter olympic village where water reclaimed from the qinghe sewage treatment plant is being used for heating and cooling systems
2408772 but it is clear that beijing is striving to be part of the green team this is all the more remarkable when set against the citys double digit economic growth

2408774 if education is always to be conceived along the same antiquated lines of a mere transmission of knowledge there is little to be hoped from it in the bettering of mans future
2408775 it really taps into the secrecy of a private moment

2408801 of all the companies performing around the world we have been most proud of the success and accomplishments of wicked in chicago because it had been decades since a dedicated broadway company was created for this wonderful city from the moment we decided to make chicago our home the entire city has truly embraced and welcomed us we thank mayor richard m daley and broadway in chicago for their tremendous support and leadership chicago is renowned as a world class city for theatre and we have been honored to be a part of the citys vibrant and growing downtown theatre district chicago will always have a very special place in wickeds heart
2408802 i congratulate the chicago company of wicked on their phenomenal run in the downtown theatre district and thank producers david stone and marc platt as well as broadway in chicago for having the foresight to launch a resident company of wicked in chicago the effects and economic impact of the show s long run in chicago will continue to be seen for many years to come the future of our city as a national center for theatre and a cultural landmark worldwide is very bright
2408803 ive always believed that chicago was a long run town but wicked has far surpassed any expectations we may have had it is by far the most successful musical that we have hosted not only in chicago but also in the entire 100 year history of the nederlander organization across the country it has been playing to sold out houses since it opened four and a half years ago at our gershwin theatre in new york as well as for the past year and a half at our pantages theatre in los angeles
2408804 fifty years later the tragedy of emmett till has lost none of its currency and has assumed an emotional and political significance of almost mythic proportions
2408805 ifas new play is an emotionally and theatrically ambitious work in which we examine our own lives and actions through the prism of an epoch defining moment in history we produce this stunning new work at the goodman with considerable pride
2408806 in the footsteps of an old man a memory a mystery myth a deconstructed reconstructed jazz play
2408807 like many people i knew the basic blueprint of emmetts story and was profoundly affected as a youth on the frontlines of racial integration
2408808 in all of my research for this piece there was very little to be found about emmett i wondered who was this boy whose summer trip to mississippi changed the course of an entire nation there was such a difference between the way emmett was described by william bradford huie in look magazine as a sexually aggressive predatory thug and the way his mother spoke of him how he whistled because he stuttered i thought that there was a real mystery play between those two worlds till is based on history but i am drawn to and am highlighting the mythic and epic elements of this saga

2408828 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2408829 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2408830 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2408831 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2408832 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2408833 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2408834 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2408835 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2408836 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2408880 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2408881 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2408882 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2408883 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2408884 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2408885 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2408886 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2408887 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2408888 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2408889 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2408890 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2408891 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2408892 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2408893 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2408894 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2408895 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2408896 learn the ways of silence when silence comes noise diappears learn the ways of peace when peace comes war disappears learn the ways of love when love comes hate disappears silence peace love these three are my prescription for happiness and godliness
2408897 if i had known i was gonna live this long i would have taken better care of myself
2408898 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2408899 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2408900 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2408901 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2408902 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2408903 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2408904 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2408905 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2408906 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2408907 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2408908 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2408909 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2408910 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2408911 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2408912 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2408913 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2408914 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2408915 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2408916 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2408917 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2408918 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2408919 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2408920 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2408921 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2408922 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2408923 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2408924 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2408925 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2408926 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2408927 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2408928 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2408929 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2408930 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2408931 it took 4 gasoline to get people to actually drive less
2408932 heavy selling across the energy and broader commodity complex has infected once indomitable crude oil
2408933 barring a physical disruption that may temporarily spike prices we judge that oil prices have peaked for the next few years
2408934 if we dont continue to drive less the supply demand balance will tighten back up
2408935 prices may go below that for a while but not for any real period of time
2408936 i would say that the dollar has really staged a pretty impressive rebound its somewhat tangential to the oil markets but there appears to be a shift in how the dollar is being looked at
2408937 the market has realized that hey were not using as much crude oil as we were particularly in the united states
2408938 our consumption is probably down 4 to 4 5 percent thats approaching 1 million barrels a day down from last year
2408939 weaves together the hopes and regrets of three characters from three generations as they reconcile who they are and who they might have been
2408940 inspirational sometimes all of us forget that love for movies that internal spark inside us that movies lit and overstreets book is going to remind many of us about it
2408941 if we stand together there is no force that can defeat georgia defeat freedom defeat a nation striving for freedom no matter how many planes tanks and missiles they use against us
2408942 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2408943 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2408944 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2408945 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2408946 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2408947 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2408948 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2408949 who are open to doing something on the production side
2408950 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2408951 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2408952 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2408953 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2408954 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2408955 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2408956 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2408957 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2408958 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2408959 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2408960 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

2408963 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2408964 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2408965 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

2408992 a little bit surprised that some of the other governors didnt see this as a looming problem for their constituents
2408993 this wasnt something imposed it seems that this backtracking would be the result of the backlash from anti muslim hate sites and islamophobes on the internet

2409018 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2409019 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2409020 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2409021 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2409022 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2409023 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2409024 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2409025 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2409026 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2409027 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2409053 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2409054 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2409055 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery

2409071 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that gt god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2409072 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what gt your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2409073 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than gt four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and gt adultery

2409083 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2409084 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2409085 we urge the chinese to do what other countries have done to sanction to put a financial squeeze on the burmese generals

2409099 we had no money because he spent it on drink i never knew what to expect when he walked through the door
2409100 my husband only ever admitted having one drink the trust was non existent
2409101 people think they are protecting the children from the drinking
2409102 my mother was heartbroken and baffled by my drinking she aged 10 years i felt guilt shame and self hatred but it only made me drink more
2409103 you have to accept that neither you nor anyone else can make someone stop drinking harmfully but you can help them to make changes
2409104 i cant control it i cant cure it i didnt cause it
2409105 its guaranteed to cleanse the body and clear the mind

2409112 as currently written the proposal prevents local law enforcement agencies from designing programs in the best interest of their communities and dictates the federal government model on them
2409113 this not only provides regulators that have proven incapable or unwilling to enforce current law a free hand since the bill provides no definition
2409114 it also handcuffs local law enforcement agencies from targeting all but the most violent criminal aliens
2409115 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2409116 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2409117 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2409118 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2409119 im not too upset about it what was it a bunch of singles and three doubles im just not real upset about it im just going to move on and ive already done that
2409120 a reckless and irresponsible prime minister has a defense minister that has no credibility shame or moral values who instead of demonstrating leadership and demanding the removal of the failure olmert delivers a slap in the face to the soldiers bereaved families and citizens who have lost their faith in democracy olmert and barak have driven the political system to a new low
2409121 id remind the agribusinessman i was on the agriculture committee id remind the banker i was on the banking committee most large contributors understand only two things what you can do for them and what you can do to them i always left that room feeling like a cheap prostitute whod had a busy day

2409125 title of blogger brian blums autobiographical blog and i didnt have the heart or gumption or will to challenge him further
2409126 were learning so much we have our own blogs you know
2409127 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2409128 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2409129 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2409130 as were all painfully aware the housing correction has had a significant impact on the us economy
2409131 in the midst of the single largest decline in real estate values since the great depression
2409132 todays challenging economic environment suggests the housing market is far from stabilising we now think were about halfway through the peak to trough decline
2409133 while we do not expect to draw on any of the new backstops going forward they provide important sources of reassurance and potential support in the event that the housing market declines even further than anticipated
2409134 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2409135 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2409136 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2409137 well know more of a time scale when he sees our doctors but its not a good situation it kind of puts a damper on things i know how much he wanted to get back and was very excited about finally feeling healthy
2409138 i feel really bad for him its one of those crazy things hit in the foot by a line drive well just let the doctors look at him and see where we go from here
2409139 he seems to think hell be able to start activity next week and go from there hell be in a splint for another week and start working out with us and start taking batting practice next week right now everything is good
2409140 he really believes he can play right handed right now
2409141 i wouldnt be afraid to do that whether we will nor not i dont know

2409173 were all first year juniors and not many teams knew whom we were coming in here
2409174 all i wanted to do was push that ball to the outfield and score that run
2409175 my defence is strong and i rely on that a lot
2409176 all i was thinking is i want to do is get a single and do anything to help my team out
2409177 it just so happened that i got a good pitch i was able to get a hold of it and it went off with a bang
2409178 im not going to start talking to teams until he tells me what teams he is willing to go to
2409179 we will certainly not sit idly by if the maple leafs take a position which is unreasonable and unfair to bryan mccabe
2409180 in our view telling him not to show up and stay home we would view that as utterly unreasonable we would undoubtedly file a grievance and pursue that one aggressively on behalf of bryan
2409181 i think in the end if it works out it would hopefully be good for bryan and the leafs
2409182 with him dictating where he wants to go probably not much
2409183 we will probably have to take back a matching contract and some players in the deal
2409184 this child has the personality of anne and the hair of anne
2409185 she has a similar personality to me and she likes to use big words and it just sounded all fun and exciting i ended up reading the rest of the series and then i wanted to come
2409186 there have been so many different mediums that the story has been presented in movies the musical in charlottetown an animated series in japan different things that have told the story of anne of green gables
2409187 so a lot of people know about it and they do want to come see where the story was set
2409188 there are definitely anne fans all over the world that come specifically to see green gables and theyre interested not only in the story but of course the author herself l m montgomery they visit the site of her cavendish home as well and sort of feel the atmosphere and the different natural landscapes that inspired the author
2409189 ive only given myself two weeks to see all of atlantic canada so im only seeing the highlights im afraid this is a highlight
2409190 i havent read the book but i think in school we did a play on it in grade 6 and there were the made for tv movies its a canadian icon so i guess im pretty much obligated to see it
2409191 this was one of the things that we said ok were there weve got to see this weve been here for a couple of days and we cannot forget to come here
2409192 id read the anne books as a kid and saw the movie she always inspired me as a kid and even in my adult life ive watched the movies many times its something i do with my mom and she loves it too she wasnt able to come this is a highlight for me you cant come all the way to p e i and not come here
2409193 we live maybe 15 miles from cross creek and they have their own little homestead and stuff like this
2409194 i love my baby so much i gave up going to sturgis this year with all my buddy bikers to come on this tour with her
2409195 i thought this would be like the readers digest condensed version of everything we can see a lot in a little bit of time
2409196 my dads side of the family is irish and french canadian ive been to ireland and scotland five times a couple of years ago i started reading up on nova scotia and p e i and people always said that without going across the ocean its the closest thing to ireland and scotland as you can find in north america
2409197 actually when i was a kid our family came to cavendish for summer vacations and i came back for business on the island but ive never been back to see green gables
2409198 so this time i had time and that was first on my list to come to see how the park is now its parks canada and thats important i find a nice place and a place that is well taken care of its very moving to see that because you see canadian heritage a woman who wrote marvelous books we have had movies tv series its great canadian history and you see all these young people taking care of that
2409199 this has been a dream of mine for 30 years when i went over that bridge yesterday there were tears in my eyes
2409200 as a junior high teacher i have probably read anne of green gables 15 times to classes i teach first grade now and theres a picture book edition that i read to the children even when i read the real book the first book im 60 and i still cry when matthew dies
2409201 i think there are so many things for children to learn with anne her imagination her spirit her positive attitude she was dealt a pretty rotten little hand in life even though she was fictional and kids today sometimes they have pretty rotten little hands dealt to them if they can learn to overcome that theres always something better if they have that spirit of anne theyre going to make it in life and we should all have a matthew in our life somebody that loves us just unconditionally
2409202 watching the sunset and sensing anne and diana right behind me i couldnt help but quote annes comment to marilla after visiting aunt josephine in charlottetown with diana
2409203 i love to teach my students the many life lessons that anne learns in the book always look on the bright side use your imagination love your land and see nature as a gift from god always try to influence people for good vanity doesnt pay off its good to forgive holding a grudge may leave you lonely kindred spirits are indeed treasures always work hard and do your best its best not to take dares chocolate caramels are wonderful every day is new with no mistakes in it a fashionable dress and a rosebud tea set is so romantic and all lives have bends in the road but we survive

2409261 als ik in mijn nieuwe positie de progressie kan maken die ik moet maken ben ik klaar voor het buitenland
2409262 ik ben de eerste belg die in zo een filmpje meedraait het is de bedoeling dat de specifieke kwaliteiten van spelers van over de hele wereld in de verf worden gezet de techniek van ronaldinho het torinstinct van ruud van nistelrooy en voor mij mijn leiderscapaciteiten een mooie erkenning de beelden werden geschoten in het stadion van charlton athletic de opnames duurden een hele dag voor de zekerheid werden er telkens drie vier shots genomen wat ik moest zeggen werd apart opgenomen dat was wel moeilijk er werd muziek onder gezet dus moest ik een zeker ritme aanhouden en ik moest spreken zoals iemand die aan het denken is sommige zinnen hebben ze wel 50 keer moeten opnemen
2409263 corporate governance is the system by which business corporations are directed and controlled the corporate governance structures specifies the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation and spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions on corporate affairs by doing this it provides the structure through which the company objectives are set and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance
2409264 corporate governance is holding the balance between economic and social goals and between individual and communal goals the governance framework is there to encourage the efficient use of resources and equally to require accountability for the stewardship of those resources the aim is to align as nearly as possible the interests of individuals corporations and society the incentive to corporations is to achieve their corporate aims and to attract investment the incentive for states is to strengthen their economics and discourage fraud and mismanagement

2409270 we sort of came around to the conclusion that all players call them achievements
2409271 we wanted to focus on getting the user interface in a good presentable form and things that other achievement systems havent done a good job of
2409272 our user interface guys went out of their way to build the achievement system so that the mod community can completely rip it apart and do whatever they wanted with it the look and how the information is presented to you
2409273 we fully expect that people will come up with their own achievement browsers and comparison systems
2409274 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

2409277 hes a religious pretender like so many people in our government who is profiting from the ideals that were written so many thousands of years ago selling communities that are faith based communities but its all motivated for his own benefit he does what he needs to do in order to succeed like some kind of virus i think an opportunistic virus
2409278 i think that sullivan groff probably wouldnt put much stock in any book that was written when the world was flat that all of these religious faiths they have to evolve and become something that has empirical truth i think that to mr groff there are things that are proof empirical proof and i think that thats what his faith is is how to achieve things like 2 plus 2 equals 4 thats a fact so hell use something in order to achieve a goal but i dont know that sullivan groff really is a truly spiritual man
2409279 ive got to tell you im so honored to be on this show that i feel like mary louise and elizabeth and kevin nealon and i we all kind of came up at the same time this show is extraordinary the way showtime and jenji and the other writers have created it is something thats not really television its not really a motion picture its kind of a beautiful hybrid and theyve invented something thats new and fresh its just an honor for me to be working with such a creative group

2409290 en chile matar por celos es mas justificados que matar por otras razones
2409291 en chile matar por celos es mas justificados que matar por otras razones
2409292 reci n se ha descorrido el velo sobre qu es lo que pasa
2409293 no es la denominaci n con la que se maneja el tema en las organizaciones que se preocupan del tema porque el nombre t cnico sigue siendo homicidio se es el gen rico
2409294 el t rmino femicidio se acu en los a os 60 para identificar la forma de violencia m s extrema contra las mujeres a partir del alevoso asesinato de tres mujeres dominicanas en manos de la polic a secreta de trujillo los asesinatos de ciudad ju rez en m xico tambi n se consideran femicidios all son masivos y sistem ticos y adem s tienen una fuerte carga de justificaci n social o semi impunidad
2409295 la red chilena contra la violencia dom stica y sexual hizo la primera encuesta sobre el tema el a o pasado con ella se buscaba develar cu ntas mujeres est n muriendo en estas circunstancias en segundo lugar investigar las historias de estas mujeres para poder identificar cu les son los principales factores de riesgo como ya se ha hecho en otros pa ses
2409296 por ejemplo mujeres que han sido golpeadas por el marido estando embarazadas est n en situaci n de riesgo vital si es alcoh lico si tiene un arma en la casa y otra serie de situaciones que dan el patr n del femicida
2409297 si estas condicionantes se lograran incorporar en las fichas de violencia intrafamiliar que llenan las mujeres que llegan a denunciar se podr an tomar medidas mucho m s fuertes que las que actualmente se toman con la violencia
2409298 en chile la violencia es considerada una falta no un delito salvo que por s misma constituya un delito es decir una violaci n una mutilaci n que ha habido
2409299 el poder judicial ni siquiera lleva estad sticas de cu ntas de las v ctimas de los juicios son mujeres por eso el femicidio todav a no es un t rmino legal
2409300 no tiene que ver con que el delito se tipifique como femicidio si no que la realidad nos muestra que hay m s denuncias por violencia intrafamiliar que por cualquier otro delito en el pa s y que entonces los problemas de
2409301 para poder tomar medidas adecuadas de prevenci n y en alg n momento erradicar la violencia se necesita saber qu es lo que realmente est ocurriendo es indispensable entonces disgregar la informaci n para determinar los casos de femicidio determinar los patrones previos de las mujeres que llegan a morir
2409302 que para ser v ctima de delitos contra la honestidad hab a que ser virgen ha evolucionado pero antes violar a una prostituta por ejemplo no era considerado delito por muchos jueces lo mismo la violaci n conyugal que ha sido reconocida hace muy poco tiempo aun as para muchos penalistas en t rminos de doctrina jur dica es una cosa imposible porque en el contrato matrimonial est n incluidas las relaciones sexuales
2409303 chile no ten a ning n tipo de informaci n hasta el a o pasado e incluso hoy es tremendamente dif cil conseguirla
2409304 es una ley muy mala porque se considera que es un problema privado y ha habido muy poca voluntad del estado de intervenir espec ficamente de tribunales estos juicios quedaron radicados en los tribunales civiles juicios de arriendo hipotecas cheques y all donde hab a una serie de abogados polite llegaron de un d a para otro un mont n de mujeres machucadas y llorando y adem s sin abogado
2409305 en un procedimiento s per escu lido que provee la ley lo primero que intentan es tratar de conciliar entonces el actuario con escasa capacitaci n busca por todos los medios poner de acuerdo a las partes para no pasar a juicio
2409306 estuve hartos a os trabajando en eso por lo tanto puedo hablar con propiedad
2409307 tengo gente conocida de la universidad que en toda su candidez me dec an yo no estudi para esto no soy asistente social eso pasa en las escuelas de leyes en que el derecho de familia es una lata o tema de minas
2409308 no no s lo las huellas directas no el contexto hay otra agravante se supone que las amenazas constituyen delito por ejemplo la amenaza de muerte muchas de las muertes son anunciadas pero normalmente las denuncias por amenazas ni siquiera las toman en carabineros una mujer que yo representaba hab a dejado 9 constancias en la comisar a m s cercana por maltrato apareci muerta y ten a los papelitos de los carabineros en su casa pero esas denuncias nunca llegaron a tribunales ni a ninguna parte
2409309 en el nuevo sistema los criterios no son principalmente de justicia porque es tan et rea que no es posible evaluar por ese lado
2409310 es posible entonces conociendo la idiosincrasia que se considere que en los casos de violencia intrafamiliar no hay un inter s p blico que sea necesario resguardar sino m s bien un asunto privado en el que se puede llegar a un acuerdo
2409311 el derecho penal necesita replantearse porque fue pensado creyendo que el delincuente y la v ctima no se conocen o por lo menos son ajenos
2409312 claro por ejemplo un tipo que est condenado por la violaci n de su hija cumple su pena de tres a os en la c rcel y despu s vuelve a su casa porque es el marido y tiene todo el derecho de volver al hogar com n por ley la justicia no las est protegiendo
2409313 claro pero necesita un nuevo juicio y lo dejan seis meses fuera de la casa el juicio puede durar un a o y en general le dan entre uno y 60 d as hay casos en que les dan dos semanas de c rcel a los hombres y vuelven al hogar con todos sus derechos
2409314 si los jueces tuvieran las herramientas para saber cu les son los casos realmente graves las cosas podr an ser diferentes pero hasta ahora todos creen que todas estas circunstancias son relativamente iguales
2409315 we hope this signals the emergence of a new competitive marketplace for privacy
2409316 by themselves these recent changes represent only a small step toward providing users the full range of privacy protections they need and deserve but if this competitive push continues it can only stand to benefit consumers
2409317 giving users true control over which information is linked back to them should be the ultimate goal
2409318 the cdt report is a timely welcome and positive reaffirmation of asks ongoing commitment to setting the gold standard for user choice on privacy
2409319 and as the cdt report calls out askerasers debut later this year will continue to set ask apart from the rest of the industry on protecting user privacy
2409320 no amount of self regulation in the search privacy space can protect consumers from bad actors
2409321 with consumers sharing more data than ever before online the time has come to harmonize our nations privacy laws into a simple flexible framework
2409322 spyproxy has limitations but nonetheless we feel that it can be an effective new weapon in the internet security arsenal as a low cost way to block real zero days that is complimentary to existing techniques and actively makes the web browsing experience more secure

2409324 desktop linux still has three serious problems to overcome before it can go mass market
2409325 i envision in the future clients having eight or nine operating systems on them that are all virtualized
2409326 i think the linux community is poised to be innovative and to create these virtual machine environments more than anyone else can today
2409327 the absence of linux based dell desktop systems simply reflected a general absence of enthusiasm for such products in the broader marketplace
2409328 it really boils down to why are cios apprehensive about deploying linux in the mission critical desktop environment i think virtualization can help to ease those cios apprehension

2409825 these some of my clothes the tunic has a hood attached to it you can use it to shield your face
2409826 aye sir and i do not know how they managed it but they have surrounded us on all sides and you know that it would be an easy feat for them to come over the bailey wall
2409827 see that our lovely prisoner is locked soundly in the tower and let no one and i mean no one come near her do i make myself clear
2409828 milord the girl is gone as well as her maid i fear she has escaped
2409829 mi milord every available guard is holding off the enemy tis only i left
2409830 my eyes deceive me else i would not see the mighty fredrick worthingham fleeing attack
2409831 go my lady there is a horse waiting for you outside
2409832 is this to be an outright slaughter or will you fight me like a man
2409833 unsheathe your sword swine and i will demonstrate just how much man i am
2409834 mount quickly my lady we must get you away from the danger of the arrows i feel it is safe here but cannot be for certain
2409835 i will bring her also to safety my lady now stay close beside me we will cross over where the men have knocked out the wall
2409836 no but we have to get the arrow out of her before it poisons her blood
2409837 inform the good people of worthingham that their liege has fallen to his demise and that the castle and lands has been claimed in the name of lord darian maxwell earl of greystone
2409838 i must hasten to greystone ere our lady could die and to inform the earl of our victory
2409839 she was struck by a stray arrow my lord she has lost much of blood
2409840 dead vachel stayed behind to secure the castle and lands
2409841 send for the leech i will take her to my chamber
2409842 oh tilden i was so worried that you would not return
2409843 nay i did not but i fear that i will always worry for your safety when you are away from me
2409844 oh tilden let us go away from here i care not whether we have a proper wedding or whether or not you are titled i just want us to be together we can find a friar in some small village and
2409845 i would not have us living like vagabonds seeking work where i may find it unsure of where our next meal will come from
2409846 but i have some money we can purchase a small manor i know darian would not object to our marriage mayhaps would even grant me a large dowry
2409847 my god sidra leave me my pride i will not live off the riches of your family twould bring shame to my name and that shame would be passed on to our sons
2409848 will you allow your pride to throw away what we share because i swear to you tilden that i will not go on meeting in secret i will not disgrace myself by becoming your mistress just because your pride will not allow you to make your love known for me before god
2409849 nay that impertinent maid of hers rushed me from the room so that she could dress her into a fresh nightshift
2409850 she is still no better i fear for her life

2409852 you might as well know that tilden and i are in love with one another i want him to marry me yet he refuses its his foolish pride that stands in the way of our happiness

2409854 ah my sister do not look so despairing for i have news that you both will like to hear
2409855 wait a moment why did you not seemed surprised at our relationship
2409856 surely you do not think that i was oblivious to those looks you two kept sending each other or those kisses you thought were shared in private give me more credit than that
2409857 since we were justified in the death of the baron of worthingham and since he has no living relatives then the lands fall into my possession but i will need a vassal to look after it so that and with the title that i am going to recommend that the king give you for your bravery i would say that you can marry and have your pride too
