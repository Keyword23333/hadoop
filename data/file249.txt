2490018 o fato de que as tropas russas estejam na oss tia do sul claramente uma resposta decis o georgiana de tentar tomar o controle da prov ncia
2490019 o presidente georgiano mikhail saakashvili tomou uma decis o muito arriscada de lan ar durante a madrugada de sexta feira uma ofensiva militar contra a regi o da oss tia do sul apoiada por moscou
2490020 foi muito irracional fazer isso porque n o acho que os ocdientais v o ao seu resgate
2490021 dar uma pequena li o aos georgianos e tamb m mostrar que al m de terem interesses na regi o t m a inten o de defend los
2490022 eles n o permitir o que a ge rgia tome este tipo de medidas sem repercuss es
2490023 por isso que a r ssia tem interesse em impedir a resolu o dos conflitos separatistas
2490024 isso pode fazer parte da rea o russa natural mas creio que o fator principal que os russos n o esperavam que os georgianos enfrentassem este assunto com meios militares
2490025 mas a envergadura da opera o militar georgiana foi tamanha que provocou uma rea o russa
2490026 o ocidente n o vai se meter numa guerra por ele principalmente contra os russo

2490029 a night that may be the most significant in modern chinese history
2490030 it doesnt matter how many big events ive been to this is the biggest
2490031 dedicated in loving memory to a friend a colleague and inspiration
2490032 seven years ago july 2001 in moscow the international olympic committee chose beijing to host these games in tiananmen square hundreds of thousands celebrated
2490033 for china the successful olympic bid was a validation of its hard fought reawakening after the painful memories of foreign occupation the cultural revolution the years of isolation
2490034 in one sense this night is the culmination of events set in motion by another sports story the surprising decision of mao zedong in 1971 to invite the american table tennis team to beijing
2490035 but culturally and especially politically china and the west have an uneasy relationship
2490036 shortly thereafter in mid may an even greater blow the cataclysmic earthquake that struck the sichuan province killed an estimated 70 000 and created five million homeless
2490037 but where hundreds of millions now experience modern prosperity its a country where the few rule the many where protest is not welcome a country that still cant shake the echoes of the 1989 tiananmen crackdown it is a country racing into the future confident it can claim its place on its own terms it has been a long long march to august 8 2008 to this moment when a historically insular civilization has invited the world to global event of epic proportions a long march to a night that may be the most significant in modern chinese history
2490038 this is zhang yimou creating a cinematic blockbuster on the floor of a stadium
2490039 this is one of those moments when we have to stop and ooh and ah
2490040 president bush still talking to vladimir putin perhaps talking about that opening drum number still
2490041 the chinese reaching their hands out to the world in an unprecedented way
2490042 what a meaningful choice by the u s delegation here in china
2490043 so many athletes will not make it to the olympic medal stand this is their olympic games
2490044 this will bring up a lot of hope for the future
2490045 i had so many clients who would sit in my chair and say i wish i could get my hair to look like this when i leave here
2490046 so i decided to put together a class to teach some of our blow dry tricks
2490047 people want sleekness but more volume right now youre not going to get volume from a flat iron
2490048 i have women who come from all over the city at the last one not one single person was one of my clients and im not trying to sell products from the salon you should be able to find the right product whether you go to a salon or cvs
2490049 get hair 90 percent dry before you start in with the brush
2490050 ive cut some womens blow dries down by 20 to 30 minutes its because they were starting out blow drying with the brush immediately
2490051 it helps smooth and add shine to the hair if you work with a softer brush instead of a hard metal brush that might be getting too hot
2490052 estoy muy satisfecho con el tiempo no pensaba que iba a nadar tan r pido en las eliminatorias ahora todo lo que s es que en la final quiero estar en la calle del centro
2490053 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2490054 fogo este gajo anda me a sarnar a cabeca outra vez
2490055 the president will hold meetings with a number of officials in the oil rich city
2490056 the loans will be 5 10 million iraqi dinars per loan to give to the unemployed graduates of colleges and institutes in wassit
2490057 the institute has set three branches of al rafidain bank in the districts of al kut and al hai 40 km south of kut and al suwayra 135 km north of kut to cash the interest free loans with a one year grace period
2490058 today a security force arrested a three member gang including a traffic policeman for counterfeiting large quantities of iraqi dinars in kut city
2490059 the gang would counterfeit 10 000 and 25 000 dinar bills and circulate them into local markets
2490060 security forces seized large amounts of the counterfeit bills in addition to equipment used for this purpose
2490061 we are proud to offer our patients the advantage of this cutting edge application of radiation technology because it promotes less x ray exposure and allows for convenient treatment when patients want care
2490062 that cumulative x ray exposure from ct scans and other sources can be very harmful so we always want to do what we can to minimize x ray exposure for patients
2490063 because it is faster and much less imposing than a traditional x ray machine
2490064 simply put patients want convenience and safety and the mini c arm offers both
2490065 im worried that theyll get sick from getting that stuff into their food or from breathing it into their bodies
2490066 ive been active in town meeting and local politics for a lot of years and the people in power today are by far the worse
2490067 julius is in the real estate business and he will benefit greatly if the split tax is adopted
2490068 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time
2490069 they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2490070 yeah got that packet ok and that one but this one needs resending
2490071 ich war schon immer ein riesen fan dieses autos seit ich das rennen damals im fernsehen gesehen habe es hat super viel spa gemacht damit zu fahren schade dass es nur f nf runden waren
2490072 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2490073 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2490074 hes had a good deal of success in this division
2490075 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york
2490076 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2490077 eu nunca gosto de dizer nunca na verdade todas as id ias tem que ser analisadas com cautela pois preciso manter os p s no ch o
2490078 nosso carro esteve bom desde a primeira volta que demos aqui fomos bem em todos os treinos livres ent o n o posso dizer que foi uma surpresa a nossa posi o de largada n s testamos aqui na semana passada e tivemos tempos animadores o que nos deixou muito confiantes para esta etapa
2490079 it can be great if we continue to stay healthy and continue to progress
2490080 consistency is the main thing we have to focus on having all our guys healthy and being full steam ahead we can do some great things seeing what we were able to do at the end of last year we have to put it together
2490081 i wanted to make sure everything they said was in there was in there
2490082 i think it stacks up pretty well with other top running backs salaries we wanted to be in the top paid and this contract did that its a big burden off my chest
2490083 this took endless hours lots of nights until midnight 1 in the morning
2490084 brian gave me three areas that were important to him he told me when the deal was done wed either met or exceeded all three
2490085 we set a timeline with the team not a deadline
2490086 we didnt want him to play without having a contract
2490087 its a complicated deal everything ive ever seen is in this deal
2490088 i think this is the most complicated contract ive ever seen not just that ive ever done i read at least a synopsis of every contract done in the league and frequently try to look at the entire contract
2490089 we think of dawkins as a hall of fame caliber player i feel like im standing up here again right before the first preseason game of the season were talking about a hall of fame caliber player
2490090 thats what drove him its what has always driven him if you put the same things i said about dawkins a few years ago if you take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team in who they are in their heart in their head that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2490091 hes going to come in he had another meeting yesterday with his doctor i think hell be in in the next little bit here
2490092 im not going to throw him right back in there i can tell you that
2490093 i havent had a chance to talk to him since this visit
2490094 theres a game plan when he gets here in terms of what is going to happen purely from a medical perspective
2490095 beyond that im sure andy has a creative plan in terms of the football part of it
2490096 the deal is fairly cap neutral to this particular year
2490097 i think it increased it a bit but nothing that would change anything we were thinking or any flexibility we would want to have it changes the cap numbers obviously over the next three four or five years it is moderately more next year significantly more in year three
2490098 i think it was the most complicated contract ive ever seen
2490099 its definitely the longest contract ive ever seen it was 52 pages of just addendums
2490100 it gives you that peace of mind and that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you
2490101 all of us wanted to get the deal done as quick as we could
2490102 but brian and his agent they hung in there there wasnt a single moment when there was any threat they couldnt have been more positive or professional throughout the whole thing even this afternoon they werent saying lets hurry up or hes not going to play in this game
2490103 i cant speak to why the deal didnt get done before but i know we kept hammering away in order to do something that made sense for the player
2490104 from the first day i was able to represent brian we worked aggressively with the team to try to make something work we tried to get very creative and find a structure that would allow us to get something done while still dealing with the rules that were in place

2490125 i could hear them being three gms back there what they would do for every team it was funny theyre very knowledgeable
2490126 i was excited about the season even before the new contract
2490127 this has given that extra measure of knowing that im going to be taken care of here im excited about this team
2490128 were talking about a hall of fame caliber player this is a premier guy leader and player
2490129 i mean what hes done the last few weeks with this going on the work he came out there when he had strep throat and practiced when he had an excuse regardless of what was going on

2490133 he presented as being sexualized well beyond his years and gave a recitation of the events surrounding his abuse which was chilling in its routine use of sexual words and phrases
2490134 i have no hesitation in concluding that the sexual degradation of the child by the accused has had a very detrimental effect
2490135 this case presents itself as a portrait of the devastating consequences of child sexual abuse
2490136 so illogical and preposterous as to lead to the conclusion it was concocted in an effort to explain away very damning evidence
2490137 we thought we had an opportunity to partner with the chinese american community in chinatown to do something rather special
2490138 philadelphia has so many unique assets to promote and demonstrate to the world that we are a great international city

2490143 it makes me feel a little bit younger until i see myself in the mirror
2490144 its like a dream come true because most of us dont have the opportunity to go to beijing

2490164 these actions have raised the costs of mortgage credit and reduced its availability
2490165 policy makers had been hoping they would move forward to provide more credit and now theyre just hoping they dont pull back
2490166 the cost of mortgage credit is getting pushed higher by the issues in the marketplace
2490167 they cant reduce their market exposure and that means more expensive mortgages
2490168 any time theres an additional imposition of fees in obtaining a mortgage it knocks some potential buyers out of the market
2490169 these are people who often rely on their good credit to buy investment properties putting little or no money down

2490189 what usain bolt did earlier this year to run a world record 9 72 put himself on a totally different level to anyone else in the 100 metres
2490190 the guy that can make the most mistakes and win is usain bolt because he is the biggest strongest and fastest guy there
2490191 they just like my name becuase its an asian name easy to say
2490192 every time i come out here i come out here in the summertime its been a favorable reaction and because of that i try to embrace them even more even when im in the states i try to stay in contact with them through chats and things of that nature because i do have a pretty wide base out here
2490193 partizans request is ridiculous because if i let them have it their way other players will follow suit and we would be left with a circus instead of a football team
2490194 i agree with the government that something needs to be done the recent increases are going to start hitting households just in time for the winter months and with millions of people already in fuel poverty this is only set to get worse on wednesday british gas raised their tariffs for the second time in six months putting their gas prices up by 35 per cent and electricity by nine per cent making them the most expensive energy tariff on the market we expect the other big energy providers to follow suit and raise their prices too
2490195 on the cross of calvary mormons and the broken tree
2490196 if you want to get a reaction in sacrament meeting just wear a cross
2490197 it is likely that joseph smith never saw a church decorated with a cross
2490198 i do not wish to give offense to any of my christian colleagues who use the cross on the steeples of their cathedrals and at the altars of their chapels who wear it on their vestments and imprint it on their books and other literature but for us the cross is the symbol of the dying christ while our message is a declaration of the living christ
2490199 the lives of our people must become the most meaningful expression of our faith and in fact therefore the symbol of our worship

2490203 this is a beta program and theres no guarantee but yes if appchecker says your program should work with say ubuntu 7
2490204 programs c c symbols mostly functions with some global variables and libraries required by an application that are satisfied by dynamically linked libraries provided by a distribution
2490205 type information expected by the application matches the type of the object provided by the distributions libraries for example the layout of a data structure might have changed or the function parameter that had previously been a 32 bit integer may have been changed to a 64 bit integer another problem that cannot be detected by the appchecker is if the details of a functions behavior changes from one version to another

2490232 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2490233 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2490234 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty
2490235 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2490236 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2490237 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2490238 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2490239 the fact that we have to deal with russia to deal with our most important national security challenges
2490240 the temperature of your rhetoric isnt a measure of your commitment to georgian sovereignty
2490241 you dont want to get so far in front of a situation that youre feeding the momentum of an escalation

2490286 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2490287 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2490288 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2490292 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2490293 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2490294 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2490295 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2490296 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2490297 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2490298 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2490299 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2490300 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2490301 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2490302 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2490307 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2490308 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2490309 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2490310 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2490311 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2490312 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2490313 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2490314 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2490315 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2490316 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2490317 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2490318 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2490319 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2490320 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2490321 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2490322 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2490323 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2490324 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2490325 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2490326 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2490327 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2490328 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2490329 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2490330 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2490331 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2490332 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2490333 who are open to doing something on the production side
2490334 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2490335 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2490336 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2490337 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2490338 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2490339 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2490340 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2490341 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2490342 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2490343 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2490344 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2490345 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2490346 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2490347 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2490348 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2490349 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2490350 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2490351 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2490352 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2490353 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2490354 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2490355 black women are beautiful and underrated the way we are built sometimes quite powerful and muscular doesnt fit the typical model figure
2490356 i want to help make a change push for black women and move everything forward
2490357 it has been a brilliant experience and such a learning curve
2490358 there are a lot of girls like me who havent always known they are capable of it or havent taken opportunities in front of them
2490359 this competition is giving recognition to black women because they are not used enough in the fashion industry i am so excited about it
2490360 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2490361 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2490362 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2490363 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2490364 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2490365 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2490366 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2490367 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2490368 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2490369 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2490370 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2490371 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2490372 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2490373 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2490374 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2490375 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2490376 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2490377 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2490378 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2490379 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2490380 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2490381 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2490382 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2490383 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2490384 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2490385 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2490386 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2490387 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2490388 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2490389 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2490390 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2490391 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2490392 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2490393 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2490394 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2490395 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2490396 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

2490414 no los tienen porque la primera cosa que aconsejar a un especialista en la materia es que se eliminaran de la parrilla de televisi n estos programas
2490415 i see no reason why they shouldnt be upfront and name the sites
2490416 you cant have a proper consultation unless people know which sites are being considered
2490417 this is the first stage in a long and thorough process
2490418 what we are looking for at this point is for all stakeholders to consider what criteria is needed to select suitable sites
2490419 by looking at the criteria first we can be confident that the second stage will only involve sites that are feasible and suitable
2490420 it makes no sense at all for us to be consulting on sites that just wont make the grade
2490421 i hope if dogs ever take over the world and they choose a king they dont just go by size because i bet there are some chihuahuas with some good ideas

2490426 der russische pr sident hat vor allem darauf hingewiesen dass der einzige weg aus der tragischen krise die durch die georgische f hrung ausgel st wurde der r ckzug der bewaffneten georgischen kr fte aus der konfliktzone ist
2490427 wir sind bereit f r einen krieg haben vorr te an treibstoff und lebensmittel wir wollen aber den konflikt beenden wenn es m glich ist wir suchen nach einem internationalen vermittler

2490434 i suppose the character of simon is a good way of taking your own prejudices and petty annoyances and blowing them up
2490435 the book is a look at the modern media as much as anything
2490436 i thought of these tub thumping tabloid journalists the hang em high brigade how would they react if they were put in a situation where they had to choose between coming face to face with a prisoner who had been through rehabilitation and one who hadnt which prisoner would they choose
2490437 the book looks at the way that celebrities no matter how minor and how little they have to celebrate are treated as if they from a different planet and everyone else is a lesser being
2490438 the way kids see talent and celebrity programmes and read heat
2490439 they think all that matters is to be famous and it doesnt matter what you are famous for
2490440 the book tries to show that theres something more to aspire towards but just settling down and having a family isnt going to get anyone on the cover of heat
2490441 theres the female character who has issues with the burkha and jilbab but the book also draws distinction in the ways radical islamists are separate from the rest
2490442 if i shoot well and i lose i will still be pleased weve got a good team and well do well at these games
2490443 we are in the mix as far as getting a medal and if we can achieve that then its brilliant
2490444 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2490445 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2490446 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2490447 il game show di raiuno di cui prender da settembre il timone al posto di flavio insinna
2490448 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis
2490449 we knew alonso was a very good player and as a result he had a good price on his head we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2490450 for me it is not a problem if he stays or not he can stay we always have felt he is a good player
2490451 we are only talking about a very very good price he is a good player if he is not going to bring a good price then it is very simple easy to understand
2490452 i heard the crowd obviously we know now as we knew before that he could stay with us
2490453 it is not positive that we may not have the players we want here before the champions league game
2490454 but the transfer window closes at the end of august we will try to do our best to bring in the players to improve us by then
2490455 i try to do the best for my club with the possibilities that you have i have done this every year since i have been here and i am trying to do the same for this coming season
2490456 a friend of allison s from work husband is playing as part of a band on friday night do you want to go see them the band is phil keaggy dave perkins lynn nichols rick cua mark williamson mike radovsky tom howard and several other players playing nothing but covers small cafe venue 5 cover do you want to go see them
2490457 hd will do more for hockey than any other sport
2490458 in some ways were disappointed in some ways we didnt have real high expectations of em
2490459 whats disappointing about the documents is how they misrepresented the financial condition of our club
2490460 they were trying to raise money so they took a few liberties with the truth and oversold their position
2490461 in an absolute worst case scenario its just exactly the same as the deal we had when we went into this and the club isnt going anywhere
2490462 boots and warren didnt have any obligation to put any more money in the team in fact we gave them a special deal that we would never ask them to put more money into the team
2490463 david poile and i have a little side deal going i take care of the situation out on the west coast and he takes care of the situation over in russia
2490464 i think we will all stand back and let the nhl handle this one this is obviously a much bigger issue than the nashville predators and i think well all be pleased with how it plays out
2490465 honestly we just dont think about it in terms of we have to do this or else weve made this commitment and as crazy as it sounds sometimes in life you just do things and you dont think about the down side or listen to the negative sure i guess there is a scenario where if no one ever showed up for a hockey game that it wouldnt turn out right the same way the titans have an unflinching belief that theyre gonna sell tickets to titans football games we feel the same way about predators hockey we feel like this franchise and the city are on the way up and its a total waste of time for me to talk about what if scenarios its important to us but there is no doubt in our mind were gonna make the attendance requirement for revenue sharing if for some reason we didnt make it one year its not the end of the world it probably goes back to conversation of how much you have to spend on this or that but again we think were headed in the right direction
2490466 i will be shocked if the nashville predators dont have the biggest increase in payroll both percentage wise and in sheer dollars of any team in the nhl said david freeman who heads the teams ownership group
2490467 theres always been that chicken and egg question about who should go first should the team increase its payroll and then hope fans and sponsors follow suit
2490468 now we feel like we really have something to play for we arent just playing for ourselves but for all the fans and the city of nashville
2490469 what exactly does this say about the relative power balance of canada and the u s when the leafs have to hire americans to fix the franchise
2490470 the mind boggles im amazed the canadian centric media types havent been screaming at the government to outlaw this already
2490471 isnt it great that the world is playing our game
2490472 all top hockey teams players and coaches should really be canadian
2490473 a black coach has never won the super bowl so our team shouldnt hire a black coach
2490474 kyle korver is the first white forward since larry bird to make 100 3 pointers in a season
2490475 the brewers have 4 black players and 5 white players on the field right now
2490476 make sure you dont draft any black hockey players theres never been a black player to win the hart trophy
2490477 thats the type of team you need to win a cup

2490479 when you get in bed with the devil your cant complain about the company
2490480 the entire premise of the movie is that the earth has become overrun with garbage and taken over my big business
2490481 this is a really good illustration of how we have to be very sensitive to what messages our families especially our children are bombarded with it is our responsibility to protect our children and shape a biblical worldview in their hearts
2490482 the hero of the movie is of course wall e sic a garbage compactor
2490483 people are on a space ship where they have been for hundreds of years and are now all overweight and lazy
2490484 what would happen if the most human thing left in the galaxy was a robot
2490485 the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to work it and take care of it
2490486 this must be a mistake someone must have accused me of murdering someone
2490487 you mean you told him to leave her alone and he wouldnt leave her alone
2490488 yeah he wouldnt listen to me so i had to do what i had to do

2490530 my contacts in haiti who support her feel like her private life is just that and should not be a factor here if anything this is a confirmation of the prized values of privacy and discretion in the national psyche rather than an explicit gay rights victory

2490534 when the trade papers actually came and i was going to sign it which would be my job i almost wanted someone else to sign it yes despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot id love to see him have the time of his life i think all football fans want to see him do well and we pray he will
2490535 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2490536 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2490537 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go forth give it all you got

2490539 stop this runaway growth in state government that was underway and ive never said that theres some magic number that when you say you hit it youve done it
2490540 the idea that were going to reduce the burden of government for taxpayers or the head count so we can reduce the cost it just simply hasnt happened

2490545 its not going to go further than that its not going to go less than that
2490546 its opened my eyes there are so many different cultures and ways of looking at the world you have to learn not always to judge just respect
2490547 i agree with the government that something needs to be done the recent increases are going to start hitting households just in time for the winter months and with millions of people already in fuel poverty this is only set to get worse on wednesday british gas raised their tariffs for the second time in six months putting their gas prices up by 35 per cent and electricity by nine per cent making them the most expensive energy tariff on the market we expect the other big energy providers to follow suit and raise their prices too
2490548 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2490549 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2490550 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2490551 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2490557 feche os olhos o que voc est vendo agora que tipo de imagens v m a sua cabe a ouvindo este som
2490558 ive been offered jobs in the affiliated minor leagues four or five years ago but it just wasnt the right situation for me and my family
2490559 ive enjoyed coming to independent baseball its a lot of work recruiting your own ball club obviously but im in the game its in my blood when it gets out of it thats when im going to quit
2490560 i never had a second chance to manage up at the big league level
2490561 i always tried to get my name circulated around but if you dont know anybody youre not going to get back into it no matter what success youve had i got interviewed for the seattle job in 1992 but nothing really came up for me and i really got turned off about it
2490562 i couldnt get a job as a coach or even a minor league manager
2490563 i think my record speaks for itself at the big league level and triple a level with the cardinals organization
2490564 eight years out of 10 wasnt bad getting into the playoffs
2490565 they dont expletive with hal and thats not any secret two hal came in at winnipeg where he had money and a damned good stadium and they supplied him with good players well i cant think of a better manager to supply with good players than hal lanier
2490566 i know some independent leagues where if you win you win and if you dont win theyre satisfied with it but ive never been like that as a player or a manager when i came to sussex i told the players what ive expected out of them weve turned it around a little but but theres still work to be done
2490567 got my heart pumping again i really didnt know how much i missed it until i got on the field in 96 in spring training and ive enjoyed it ever since
2490568 i guess after spending 10 years in winnipeg its a little different riding on buses nowadays than it was when i was playing because theyre a lot nicer and everything else
2490569 but i dont mind the trips here in the can am league theyre a lot shorter the only long trips are to ottawa and quebec in winnipeg youd go 15 hours to the chicago area 13 hours to kansas city and we bussed it that was rough then but you get used to it i never complained about the bus trips
2490570 the players that youre getting have either been in organizations or have been in independent baseball a long time and know what theyre here for that doesnt mean they dont have their sights set on getting back with an organization and thats what i try to do for my players in the 13 years ive been in independent baseball
2490571 i have a lot of pride in what i do as the manager during the off season and during the season
2490572 especially after three or four years in independent baseball getting my name back out there going to winter meetings and everything you know sometimes it never happens you just have to go what is right in your career at that particular time
2490573 i look back at it ive enjoyed all 13 years ive been in independent baseball and i wouldnt take it away for anything
2490574 they are executing a search warrant and being as meticulous as possible
2490575 as soon as it became a crime scene we left the building
2490576 we have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers
2490577 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2490578 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2490579 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2490580 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2490581 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2490582 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2490583 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2490584 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2490585 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2490586 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2490587 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2490588 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation
2490589 theres going to be a lot of drama and people saying i lost on the scale thats some expletive
2490590 i was willing to put my life on the line to make this happen i was going to win this tournament i was going to make sure that everyone back home knew that i had given my best and i gave it my whole effort i look back at it and know i gave it 110 percent ive been through cutting weight so many times i know the process this time my body wouldnt do it i just stood up and then i was looking at the ceiling
2490591 honestly this was the first time in five years that i came to a tournament and everything was working even though my shoulder is hurting and will need surgery after the olympics i had no other problems i came in 100 percent healthy
2490592 weve been sitting down and talking about it for a few days and we dont have a conclusion yet
2490593 one day we need one thing and the next day we need another thing

2490611 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2490612 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2490613 we have been appreciative of the american efforts to pacify the hawks in tbilisi
2490614 apparently these efforts have not succeeded quite a number of officials in washington were really shocked when all this happened
2490615 i called the group on their resistance and asked them to consider how they were exhibiting the very behaviors they complained about in their clients
2490616 a particular anxiety is caused by the fact that the escalation of military activities in the conflict zone causes fatal casualties among the civilian population and urges people to flee away as refugees
2490617 we were going towards this aim for over 5 years
2490618 with the renewed interest in these cars automakers were able to spend more resources on them
2490619 compact cars of today are not the compact cars of 10 years ago they rival in quality and equipment luxury cars of 10 years ago

2490623 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2490624 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2490630 im at a stage now where i want to enjoy the last two or three years of my career and make the most of it thats the most important thing for me
2490631 things have been very encouraging at accrington so far and im delighted to be here
2490632 of course i want to play league football for as long as i possibly can im doing that at accrington stanley so lets just hope we can have a good season
2490633 i had a good time with preston probably the happiest time ive had at club level was at deepdale
2490634 i enjoyed all of my time there it started off in what is now league one and we almost got to the premier league
2490635 there was a good bunch of players and a good manager at the time it was all a very positive experience it was all great
2490636 to have also represented northern ireland thats something im proud of and pleased about that was a real achievement for me
2490637 but thats all in the past ive now got to concentrate on my league career with accrington
2490638 before i signed john coleman and jimmy bell were very positive about where they feel the team is heading this season well just see what happens
2490639 i heard there was a problem conceding goals last season im just part of the whole team it is everybodys responsibility to defend

2490671 training went well in macau and we got out just before the typhoon struck now we are nicely settled in and waiting for the games to start
2490672 as usual we have a 36 hour rule that says anyone with a match early in the games wont take part in the opening ceremony so the doubles players will but tracey and andrew wont and they understand that

2490675 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2490676 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2490677 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2490678 we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
2490679 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2490680 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2490681 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2490682 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2490683 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2490726 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
2490727 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
2490728 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
2490729 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
2490730 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
2490731 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
2490732 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

2490762 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2490763 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2490764 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2490765 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2490766 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2490767 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2490768 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2490769 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2490770 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future

2490772 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous

2490793 estamos trabajando para tener un modelo de financiaci n antes de que se voten las enmiendas a la totalidad de los presupuestos generales del estado
2490794 buena parte del contenido de la nueva financiaci n se ha de plasmar en los presupuestos
2490795 yo quiero pensar que tendremos unos presupuestos del estado tan respetuosos con el modelo de financiaci n que propone el estatut que no tendremos ning n problema en votarlo
2490796 grave un hecho serio que el gobierno haya incumplido el estatut de catalu a y hemos de lamentar la falta de compromiso del gobierno de hacerlo posible
2490797 es muy serio el incumplimiento del estatut en un tema tan importante como este
2490798 queremos un buen acuerdo no aceptaremos un mal acuerdo ni un acuerdo a cualquier precio
2490799 preservar la unidad es fundamental con ciu pero tambi n con el resto de formaciones pol ticas para intentar compartir planteamientos
2490800 mucho de lo que estamos defendiendo ha de ser compartido para estar a la altura de lo que pide el pa s porque el pa s en este tema tiene un criterio nico el clima de opini n que existe en este tema es de unidad
2490801 ya que en esta unidad ha de haber una parte propositiva y ver c mo se concreta lo que dice el estatut
2490802 podremos avanzar sobre los contornos de la cifra en las negociaciones que tenemos
2490803 no romperemos la baraja pero no aceptaremos que nos hagan trampas
2490804 seguir trabajando con toda la fuerza y toda la determinaci n hasta el ltimo segundo del ltimo minuto del ltimo d a para que catalu a consiga el objetivo de la nueva financiaci n que necesitamos
2490805 una mala situaci n econ mica a los que no perjudica es a nosotros porque si la receta del estado es m s gasto social y el gasto social lo hacen las ccaa es precisamente eso lo que hay que aumentar si se tiene el estado en la cabeza
2490806 defender el pleno cumplimiento del estatut de autonom a de catalunya y exigir el nuevo modelo de financiaci n que establece
2490807 el incumplimiento por parte del gobierno del estado de los compromisos adquiridos y el menosprecio que manifiesta por el cumplimiento del estatut
2490808 incumplimiento por parte del gobierno de estado s lo puede considerarse como una grave actuaci n ya que deslegitima el necesario cumplimiento de la ley en este caso del estatut
2490809 s lo puede generar m s desencanto y frustraci n en la sociedad catalana y menos confianza en la pol tica y en el propio modelo de autogobierno de catalunya
2490810 a una injusticia que afecta la ciudadan a de catalunya y de otras comunidades aut nomas de r gimen fiscal com n que reciben menos ingresos por c pita para gestionar las mismas competencias homog neas
2490811 agravada por el hecho de que la aportaci n fiscal per c pita es muy superior a la media
2490812 queda por definir c mo vamos a hacer un sistema que s sea suficiente en el tiempo que garantice la suficiencia din mica
2490813 pero a lo largo del tiempo ha demostrado que no era capaz de incorporar algunas variables
2490814 los nuevos costes de la prestaci n de determinados servicios
2490815 sobre esto castilla la mancha quiere una mayor concreci n
2490816 no vamos a aceptar que la financiaci n se limite a garantizar s lo los servicios esenciales
2490817 queremos que se garantice la financiaci n de todas las competencias transferidas
2490818 los m s de 2 5 millones de empleados del sector servicios generan 135 000 millones de euros anuales algo que sit a a madrid 10 puntos por encima de la media nacional en cuanto al peso que tiene este rea en la econom a

2490821 i think it will take some time for the boys to really mature some of them came from national teams and basically our planning and focus is for the 2009 south east asian games we are trying to build a team to compete in the games
2490822 for us the most important thing is to go to the games and win a medal and to help our boys get into the national team then we would have done our job
2490823 but we are still taking these u18 league games seriously we are trying to compete in the prime league
2490824 i think were not similar nfa u16 are a young team with some experience players to back them we bring in new players every year throw away half the team they bring in new players and throw away half their team
2490825 it will be a very interesting match to watch and they always play very attractive football but young players are young players and they tend to make mistakes
2490826 its good for us to advance further in cup competitions but the league is more like a marathon so well want to focus on it now
2490827 the forthcoming match depends on how seriously home take us and i hope they wont they take us lightly
2490828 i suppose home has to be at their best when they play us
2490829 i feel it would not an easy game as geylang utd have been on a good cup run recently
2490830 alcanzar un acuerdo fruct fero en los pr ximos meses
2490831 durante estos ltimos a os ha disminuido la conflictividad estado generalitat
2490832 no se puede pretender resolver en dos a os lo que se viene arrastrando desde hace veinte
2490833 el hecho que no haya un acuerdo definitivo hoy no significa que pueda alcanzarse ma ana
2490834 el gobierno del psoe mantiene su posici n de mano tendida y voluntad de seguir dialogando porque hay acuerdo en que el actual sistema de financiaci n no sirve y hay que cambiarlo
2490835 est cumpliendo con lo dispuesto por el estatuto de catalu a
2490836 se cumplen los plazos en tiempo y forma seg n lo establecido en el estatuto catal n
2490837 un proceso complejo que debe afrontarse con riego tiempo y forma
2490838 el gobierno socialista se ha mostrado especialmente sensible con las islas baleares que padecen una situaci n de insuficiente presupuestaria p blica este compromiso se traduce en hechos como el acuerdo que cerraron recientemente el presidente rodr guez zapatero y el presidente del govern balear francesc antich para un convenio de 400 millones de euros destinado a nuevas infraestructuras e inversiones en materia ferroviaria
2490839 it was a spirited performance from geylang united who was very quick and practised tight marking
2490840 that meant we couldnt be as quick as we wanted to and i would have been worried if we were unable to create chances
2490841 the only moment that happened came on the point where amali had scored as the game is all about creating and scoring goals we are still learning from it and hope to do better
2490842 the injury to the opponent was frightening and it rarely happens but i am happy to get the three points today and its the first game this season that we have keep pace with the league leader
2490843 adam and haziq were showing strains towards the end and they had to be rested we will miss ridzuwan for the next game against tampines rovers as he has to spend his family holiday but thankfully he will be back the next game
2490844 it was difficult for us both sides were even and we conceded a goal we took a few minutes to settle back in and we looked a bit better but after farizs injury the players got shell shocked as he was unconscious
2490845 we were more aggressive in the second half but i think the penalty was just a blow to us but credit to the boys as they showed character fighting spirit and effort till the end but its a sad day for the club
2490846 our performance was there we played exceptionally in the second half but if you do not score you lose the game
2490847 we lacked an out and out striker and with khairul anwar with us for the return leg we are hopeful and confident of getting the result that can take us through to the semi finals
2490848 relief thats my feeling now after the tremendous pressure we faced in the second half the two teams played good football but we lost possession in the second half which gave our midfield and defence problems and contributed to their strong attacks
2490849 it will be another tough game there will need to be some luck for the team that eventually goes through to the semi final
2490850 yesterday was very emotional but at the same time a tough moment as we had to wait a lot of time there and i finished the opening ceremony very tired
2490851 but when we went in to the stadium it was special
2490852 this and the u s open is the last big fight
2490853 ive waited all summer last year for you to bring me to lake mcbride

2490856 this was probably the hardest bout i fenced in my career but you know i did what i had to do

2490871 it is very clear now that if we were to sign such a peace treaty under the framework of the one china principle then i think this would mean for the 23 million people of taiwan a treaty of surrender
2490872 taiwan is an independent sovereign country taiwan is not part of china nor is taiwan a local government of the peoples republic of china
2490873 people dont like tension and he likes tension and whenever he can he does what he can to increase tensions
2490874 he is like a smiling tiger hiding a dagger in a smile with honey in his mouth but a sword at his stomach
2490875 in general it is in conformity with our partys platform
2490876 the mainland side should remove the almost 1 000 missiles targeted against taiwan and they should do it before we start negotiations
2490877 they just like my name becuase its an asian name easy to say

2490886 last week new figures showed still rising hiv infections in gay and bisexual men with about 53 percent of new cases in that group
2490887 sega hopes to score with homely japanese women perhaps youve rescued the universe from marauding space pirates on your nintendo ds but can you save civilization from your own ugly face
2490888 saying youve been civilly united will never be the same as saying youre married but at least gay couples will no longer face the prospect of paying more to prepare their taxes
2490889 the last vestige of discrimination in our state marriage laws against same sex couples
2490890 sega hopes to score with homely japanese women perhaps youve rescued the universe from marauding space pirates on your nintendo ds but can you save civilization from your own ugly face
2490891 but the more important question is how are you doing hows your involuntary vacation going
2490892 lauras got me doing a few projects around the house
2490893 hey i know youre skeptical alex but just humor me
2490894 oh no but i forgot to tell you that im going to see tonys friend today
2490895 actually im not sure what he is but tony calls him his guru
2490896 is there anyone else you can see while youre already in the city
2490897 well i suppose itll do you some good to get out of the house
2490898 well i was wondering when you were going to move those boxes out of the garage
2490899 theyve been sitting there since we moved and id like to be able to fit my car in the garage this winter is that a problem
2490900 im nandin vignashwawa my friends call me vig pleasure to meet you please come in
2490901 i hope you didnt get dressed up on my account
2490902 well did our friend tony try to convince you that youd find me in flowing robes or naked meditating under tree
2490903 no no but i think he did refer to you as his guru
2490904 well if by that he meant teacher then i suppose thats ok i taught at st johns for many years
2490905 in fact i just saw that last week at the met its interesting
2490906 im glad that youre familiar with shiva of the natraja thats what made me rich
2490907 i hope tony didnt send me down here just to talk to this college professor about ancient eastern art and frankly he looks comfortable but not exactly rich
2490908 im a business teacher but youd be surprised what you can learn about business from certain works of art
2490909 i enjoy baseball i dont get over to shea as often as id like to even though its only a few minutes from here
2490910 its a nice day why dont we walk over to the park across 73rd street we can get some fresh air and chat
2490911 maybe im not the only guy in new york without a job
2490912 my father tried to teach me but he traveled a lot and i never really got into it
2490913 but you were familiar with that one hindu icon shiva of the nataraja yes
2490914 sure ive seen it in books and museums alex said wondering what point the old man was trying to make
2490915 youve seen it but have you really studied it perhaps you took an eastern philosophy class in college
2490916 at the high school i went to they asked a kid to prove the law of gravity he threw the teacher out the window
2490917 what would you say if i told you that the shiva image holds the keys to understanding how to build an extraordinary business
2490918 i understand your trepidation youve lost your job youre probably not feeling very good about your situation but i assure you it is only temporary together were going to try to look at the big picture as business clich goes
2490919 but i just want to get back on my feet as soon as possible im not someone who likes to stay still
2490920 the men arrived back at vigs home where the old man served some chivda a traditional indian snack known as bombay mix
2490921 let me explain to you what i meant about shivas analogy to business perhaps it will give you some new perspectives as you decide where to go from here
2490922 this image has played a major role in hindu culture for thousands of years in fact shiva of the nataraja may well be the most studied and worshipped religious symbol in the world people have structured their entire lives around the message in this symbol im not suggesting you do that but within this image there are several key traits that define a successful business
2490923 there is a great deal of activity within shivas cosmic dance in fact i would go so far as to say that understanding these elements and applying them to business will make entrepreneurial companies more successful
2490924 well i cant argue the fact that its a complex symbol but im not sure i see how the figures imagery has hidden secrets for success in business
2490925 actually some people assert that the shiva characteristics could reveal secrets to success in many aspects of life
2490926 but from a business context what im suggesting is that the key elements in the shiva image can be interpreted as the foundation needed to create an extraordinary company you could look at each aspect as a pillar to building a dynamic and thriving business
2490927 of course you have to take each element of the shiva image and understand the symbolism first for instance youll notice how shiva is dancing within this ring of flames why is he surrounded by this what does it mean in traditional interpretation this fire enclosure represents the cosmos or whole perceived universe shiva is the dancer in the flames and the flames represent matter and energy constantly swirling and transforming its an ever changing whirl of chaos and destruction and creation
2490928 so the ring of fire surrounding shiva represents the universe
2490929 but even more than that it is all encompassing its dynamic its transformative but taken in a business framework it suggests something more when you think of the truly astounding companies over time they all set out to do something truly transformative or universal no me too businesses here
2490930 like having a new product or service thats designed to change the industry
2490931 now like the ring of flames each key element within the shiva nataraja image represents a specific attribute
2490932 we could look at all the parts of the image to see what they symbolize
2490933 we can look at the drum or damaru in shivas upper right hand or the flame he is holding in his upper left hand or the demon dwarf upon which shiva stands with one leg each one of these components of the image holds a special meaning and each one has meaning for modern day business
2490934 i have to say this is not what i expected to come here and talk about but what youve said has got me thinking
2490935 clearly theres much more to it than that but i think you get the idea
2490936 but id be interested to know what else makes a shiva company it cant just be that they want to change the world
2490937 remember its easy to fool the eye but its hard to fool the heart
2490938 sega hopes to score with homely japanese women perhaps youve rescued the universe from marauding space pirates on your nintendo ds but can you save civilization from your own ugly face
2490939 google cannot be possible can it it just doesnt make any sense
2490940 yes but what makes them different from all the rest
2490941 well then you must know of shiva of the nataraja the dancing shiva
2490942 i cant believe i had to fly to africa to meet a man from washington to explain my own cultural history to me so that i might understand the unexplainable
2490943 man looks in the abyss theres nothing staring back at him at that moment man finds his character and that is what keeps him out of the abyss
2490944 theyre almost asleep youll get them all riled up if you go up there now
2490945 theres leftover pizza in the fridge if you want to heat it up
2490946 its not that cut and dried ive got a lot invested there
2490947 maybe i should wait for a golden parachute though i hear theyre only offering lead parachutes now
2490948 have you thought at all about what we are going to do if they shoot down your plan
2490949 whats going to happen if the company goes under how are we going to afford to stay in this house
2490950 alex loyalty to the job is fine to a point but you have to think about us youre supposed to be the ambitious one remember you should have been looking for months you gotta give yourself some options
2490951 it couldnt be any harder than what youre dealing with now
2490952 i need more time im just not ready to give up yet
2490953 youve got a high pressure job im sure youre up to your ass in alligators yet it doesnt seem to get to you
2490954 ive tried to stay positive but its just wearing me down
2490955 you were going through a rough patch a while back how did you get through it
2490956 i still feel like im in over my head at times but i just try to go with the flow no matter how chaotic it gets ive just learned to stay calm and keep it in perspective
2490957 because you always seem like youre on top of the world
2490958 youve always been like the lone ranger you gotta reach out sometimes
2490959 i dont want to have to depend on anyone else to save my skin
2490960 theres nothing wrong with being self sufficient im just saying that theres no shame in asking for help
2490961 no the guy im thinking you need is an actual guru from india at least thats what i call him really bright guy he used to teach at st johns in queens i bet hed talk to you if i give him a call
2490962 a guru youve got to be kidding hows your guru gonna help me
2490963 all i know is this guys the real deal his approach is a little out there but you know what just go talk to him decide for yourself i will say this much i was at a bit of a crossroads when i met him and he really got me back on track
2490964 you may not be able to pronounce his name though got a pen let me write it down for you
2490965 this is difficult for all of us but im sure youve seen the writing on the wall the board rejected your plan cold frankly some of them were surprised that youd propose anything so ambitious given our situation theyve decided on a different direction and we just dont see you fitting into these plans this isnt just you were making cuts across the board
2490966 were in no position to be offering much of a severance package well keep you on insurance for 60 days but im sure youll have something else lined up in no time
2490967 thats the difference between apple and my now former company
2490968 i was blindsided by this and i really shouldnt have been for some reason even with all the signs i thought i was immune
2490969 we discussed this alex you were so caught up in fixing things there that you didnt think about your own situation
2490970 i dont know im just at a loss for where to go from here
2490971 ill try him tonight maybe i can actually catch some of the yankees sox game on tv
2490972 tony its alex you watching the game am i interrupting
2490973 no way seriously you were their only chance for a comeback what happened
2490974 i went out on a limb and when i turned around they sawed it off no heroic turnaround plan for me
2490975 so they let you go what the hell are you ok
2490976 i guess im a little freaked out and pissed at myself for not being smarter about all this
2490977 maybe i just need a little distance to get it in perspective
2490978 yeh take your time catch your breath just chill for a few weeks
2490979 i dont know maybe ill google him and get the real scoop
2490980 he lives in utopia in queens right near the st johns campus he used to teach there this mystic eastern guy lives in utopia pretty ironic huh
2490981 very funny but could that be any harder for me to get to
2490982 big papi just hit a 2 run homer and gave the red sox the lead
2490983 sega hopes to score with homely japanese women perhaps youve rescued the universe from marauding space pirates on your nintendo ds but can you save civilization from your own ugly face

2491032 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude people ask why is there poverty in the world its a silly question poverty is the default human condition the interesting question isnt why is there poverty its why is there wealth or why is there prosperity here but not there at the end of the day the first answer is capitalism rightly understood that is to say free markets private property the spirit of entrepreneurialism and the conviction that the fruits of your labors are your own in large measure our wealth isnt the product of capitalism it is capitalism and yet we hate it leaving religion out of it no idea has given more to humanity the average working class person today is richer in real terms than the average prince or potentate of 300 years ago his food is better his life longer his health better his menu of entertainments vastly more diverse his toilette infinitely more civilized and yet we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual meanwhile billions have ridden capitalism out of poverty and yet the children of capitalism still whine
2491033 when world war ii ended the united states had the only undamaged industrial power in the world our military might was at its peak and we alone had the ultimate weapon the nuclear weapon with the unquestioned ability to deliver it anywhere in the world if we had sought world domination then who could have opposed us but the united states followed a different course one unique in all the history of mankind we used our power and wealth to rebuild the war ravished economies of the world including those of the nations who had been our enemies may i say there is absolutely no substance to charges that the united states is guilty of imperialism or attempts to impose its will on other countries by use of force
2491034 lots of iranian people know that the mullahs are losing iraq and more of them would know if we had a more accurate and honest press and an administration capable of explaining the world and its reaction to it our miserable policy which is to chant we dont want regime change we want a change in behavior is doomed as the whole world has known from the get go paradoxically this non aggressive policy is destined to make military conflict inevitable whoever is the next president this policy is a preemptive acquiescence to a nuclear iran with all the incalculable consequences attendant to it and is guaranteed to bring us face to face with the sarkozy option of bomb iran or iran with the bomb and yet the iranian regime is hollow so far as we know they are without atomic bombs and a reliable delivery system we have defeated them in iraq and will repeat it in afghanistan their economy is a shambles their people hate them they present us with potemkin weapons systems it is a political explosion ready to happen it only needs the support of the west

2491270 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2491271 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2491272 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2491273 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2491274 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2491275 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2491276 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2491277 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2491278 we received two lakh forms last time it is near impossible to verify every prospective buyer before the draw of lots
2491279 the first step is to scrutinise details of the applicant against our computerised data this is to find out if he already owns a dda flat if the dda is still suspicious of an allottee who has passed the computer test a closer scrutiny is carried out and his antecedents are checked with the help of personal information like the pan etc
2491280 families which own more than one non dda homes can fill in these different addresses in their forms the dda will not be able to identify such cases unless they are checked very closely

2491284 i think id need to know more about your past relationships perhaps you are a troubled man whose girlfriend died a few years ago and you havent really been living your life and i am the first woman to make you see that there is life beyond death
2491285 the movie would def start in a quick back and forth from a young ny woman getting hit on by those guys you describe in the mean time you would have my alter ego in his bike to work on the phone with a friend going for a run youll be in and out of cabs maybe break a heel or for extra drama have you have a quick verbal skirmish with a stuck up web celeb which leaves you feeling not so cool and then break a heel well just embellish my loneliness for a bit throw in a cat to emphasise that my only real friend is a pet it would have to have a silly name ftp or napster or something well have some satc references in there a poster or a dvd set when you come to amsterdam we will need at least one crisis that pushes us apart something where you call you mother and she goes nuts or something or maybe an old bf from paris who tries to find you in adam we could do a chase with trams and metros that would end in reconciliation
2491286 i must say thank you to the faculty and staff of the wee kim wee school of communication and information for inviting me to give your convocation address

2491305 our main finding was a significant improvement in the function of small finger blood vessels after reduction of indoor air particles this effect most likely indicates a general improvement in the function of the inner lining of small vessels including those supplying the heart
2491306 this suggests that indoor air filtration represents a feasible means of reducing cardiovascular risk
2491307 we expected that removing air particles with the hepa filters would result in improvement of mvf but we were heartened and surprised by the extent it did considering the modest levels of particles in the indoor air of the homes of the elderly

2491412 if anything we need to expand attention in these areas
2491413 the global burden of climate change attributable diarrhea and malnutrition are already the largest in the world in southeastern asian countries including bangladesh bhutan india maldives myanmar and nepal
2491414 illness and death are expected to increase from diarrheal diseases due to drought and flooding and are also expected from increased amounts of cholera bacteria in coastal waters
2491415 rather than slowing down the problem is accelerating there is a crisis of inaction in addressing and preparing for climate change
2491416 if you look at a power station clearly there are many areas where theres large scale machinery working they are very tall structures

2491453 la respuesta que se est dando por parte de zapatero a la cuesti n de la consulta es desproporcionada unilateral y dif cilmente entendible
2491454 rodr guez zapatero ha tomado la decisi n unilateral y personal de suspender la consulta porque aqu su voluntad es imponer que los vascos no podamos hacer nada que desde madrid no quieren que hagamos ya nos han dicho en m s de una ocasi n que no tenemos derecho a decidir nuestro futuro y ahora nos est n diciendo que no tenemos derecho ni siquiera a opinar
2491455 es lo que estamos defendiendo en las reuniones que estamos manteniendo con el resto de formaciones pol ticas queremos convencerles de que la consulta se tiene que hacer y desgraciadamente a d a de hoy el pnv ya dej sentado que ellos van a acatar la decisi n del tc que es lo mismo que decir que no van a empujar para que la consulta se haga
2491456 paso importante en torno a la cuesti n de la materializaci n del derecho a decidir
2491457 es sacar el derecho a decidir del centro del debate pol tico y por eso es tan importante para zapatero que el pr ximo ejecutivo vasco no sea nacionalista
2491458 un candidato teledirigido desde madrid no va a defender los intereses de los vascos
2491459 se va a dedicar m s a las genuflexiones ante zapatero y el gobierno espa ol que a empujar por las necesidades de los vascos
2491460 desde madrid se rechazan sistem ticamente las iniciativas que se aprueban con el respaldo mayoritario del parlamento vasco
2491461 los vascos no se pueden permitir un lehendakari que no cree en el derecho a decidir

2491471 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2491472 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2491473 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally

2491475 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2491476 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2491477 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2491478 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2491479 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2491480 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2491481 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend

2491503 i had a convertible that plays a major part in this sighting
2491504 i was northbound on route 19 and i turned onto freedom cryder road back in 1965 it was a very rural area you had farmhouses further down the road toward freedom we turned down this road about ten or twenty five minutes after ten oclock
2491505 that light up there its getting awful close and i dont hear anything
2491506 but i couldnt get the engine started we jumped out of the car ran across the road into a field and hid under a fallen tree by now the object was over the car illuminating the area as dark as it was i could see my car alan said the object reminded him of a teardrop and to me it looked like an upside down ice cream cone
2491507 it was white hot really bright brighter than anything ive ever seen in my life it wobbled and swayed back and forth i wanted to get a better look at it and i stood up to take a better look then i felt this wave of heat hit my face
2491508 another car came down the road in the opposite direction stopped by my car and looked at it and then sped away i dont know if he was a witnessed to what happened but after looking at my car he didnt waste much time getting away from it
2491509 the chrome strip around the windshield was so hot i couldnt even touch it it burned my hand
2491510 alan and i dropped the girls off they said they never wanted to discuss this again and that we shouldnt say anything to anybody since who would believe four teenagers with alcohol on their breaths

2491514 i was really shocked my car was white the hood and the trunk lid had bubbles all over them the chrome around the windshield was burned to a bluish color
2491515 because he might have thought i was some sort of nut
2491516 he thought it might be a defect in the metal from the factory since the paint wouldnt stay on the car i kept the car for about two more months then i got rid of it i just couldnt stand being in the car
2491517 and also was involved with governmental cover ups lily got married and moved out to the midwest mary i saw about a year ago and we spoke about old times when the sighting came up she repeated that she didnt want to know about it it never happened

2491702 this objective attitude of the mind deprives it from both the bliss of enjoyment and the pain that comes out from its attachment to life

2491728 2 15 and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it
2491729 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it
2491730 3 1 now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made
2491731 3 4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die 3 5 for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil
2491732 3 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat
2491733 and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died
2491734 4 1 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord
2491735 4 9 and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother

2491748 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2491749 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2491750 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2491751 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2491752 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2491753 its just a gaming console how hard is it to mess that up
2491754 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2491755 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2491756 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2491757 the f b i is committed to protecting the news media consistent with the first amendment and department of justice policies and we very much regret that this situation occurred
2491758 i want to find more about what this is about
2491759 we will be asking our general counsel to advise us on what more we should be doing about this
2491760 i told the director that it was gracious of him to apologize of course wed still like to know more about how this happened and how the bureau is securing against similar violations in the future
2491761 the phillies are mlbs homeless sifting through the garbage to find unwanted trash
2491762 hes not walking anyone or allowing home runs he also has a very strong groundball rate
2491763 i dont understand how continually building your team isnt a better strategy than just pulling a yankee
2491764 the good of the many outweighs the needs of the few
2491765 the f b i is committed to protecting the news media consistent with the first amendment and department of justice policies and we very much regret that this situation occurred
2491766 i want to find more about what this is about
2491767 we will be asking our general counsel to advise us on what more we should be doing about this
2491768 i told the director that it was gracious of him to apologize of course wed still like to know more about how this happened and how the bureau is securing against similar violations in the future
2491769 this liberal will be all about socializ er uh er pause uh about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies
2491770 we the government should own the refineries then we can control how much gets out into the market
2491771 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that sen obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
2491772 we are seeking legal clarification on the use of the councils powers
2491773 we are committed to developing a store at raglan street and our work at the royal hospital shows we are committed to the project in total
2491774 in the meantime the council continues to work with both parties and hopes to find ways to resolve the issue as soon as possible
2491775 it is still on westfields books for development but i understand they are struggling to get the necessary number of pre lets before they can start work
2491776 in the current market it is unlikely the project will be brought forward quickly although the agency is keen to support the delivery of employment on the site
2491777 excuse me become a what become a what you mean a white hole dont you
2491778 could i get an apology from the commissioner in this day and age you dont sit around a table when you have diversity and refer to a black hole
2491779 it was the stupidest most southern fried lame brained decision i ever made in my life to vote to let them go i actually cast a vote that i knew would sign our death warrant
2491780 if a dalit woman like me can become the chief minister of uttar pradesh not once but four times why can i not become the prime minister of india
2491781 i will not disclose his name in my lifetime but keep it a secret
2491782 i can assure you the person will be acceptable to the dalit community
2491783 when i was young and irresponsible i was young and irresponsible
2491784 this had been a dead end street that was re opened and filled with strip clubs really mean bars and vacant store fronts
2491785 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2491786 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish
2491787 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2491788 why cause you scared of me scared im a say something you expletive right think i wont say something
2491789 there is so much pressure to be like everyone else
2491790 this year i think i am going to spend 300
2491791 to have this kind of hatred unleashed in one of our congregations is tragic but it only strengthens our resolve to stand for the equal rights of all including those hurting and alone in the world as this shooter seemed to be
2491792 we stand for an open accepting liberal religion we encourage diversity and work to ensure social justice
2491793 our church has buddhists christians jews pagans atheists and agnostics
2491794 they come from many different paths but we agree on one thing we agree that all people are welcome and accepted as equals in our congregation
2491795 at each one of our weddings my mom joan ferris minardi would sing the traditional catholic song on this day o beautiful mother
2491796 we still feel shes an important part of our lives and is encouraging and cheering us from above
2491797 for years we discussed going into business together but the timing wasnt right until christmas of 2006
2491798 were very excited about our jewelry and the fusion of our christian faith family and fashion we believe theres a fashion niche for people who want to display their faith but with a little style
2491799 of course were online and people can order jewelry there
2491800 but mainly were marketing our line by sending jewelry to prominent catholic figures contacting catholic periodicals such as
2491801 there are 46 grandkids between all of us some weeks i have to give a whole 20 hours to it sometimes i work late into the evening because i have to wait until the kids are in bed we have a demanding sports schedule so its really squeezing the job in when i can but we are all very strong in our faith and we put our business in gods hands
2491802 the funkiness of prince mixed in with the soulfulness of bb king with a little george benson on top
2491803 we try to keep everyone in the audience involved and play something for everyone
2491804 we kind of exist in the contemporary jazz market but our audience extends beyond that
2491805 were also looking to spread more into europe and expand our audience there
2491806 jimi hendrix eric clapton and b b king those are the initial inspirations for me to play guitar
2491807 then i moved on to more r amp b style players george benson and larry carlton that was the last piece of the puzzle and they really inspired me to play jazz
2491808 its important to me for kids to be exposed to music mtv or tv in general in my opinion does not always paint the full picture for them musically
2491809 we talk about the kind of music were playing the artists that developed the styles and make it really fun
2491810 i have experienced the dayton jazz energy a simply inspiring jazz crowd
2491811 one of the things ive noticed as a mom is ive been horrible about making my kids read
2491812 if they read just 15 minutes a night that gets them focused back on their reading skills
2491813 or for kids that arent readers yet parents can make sure they are reading to their children
2491814 slowly move it back every few days work it back earlier by a half hour so its not a huge jolt
2491815 this can really decrease anxiety and gives kids a sense of control
2491816 if you drop them off for the first week and then they start riding the bus they havent gone through the same things other kids do
2491817 discuss what else they can do and have them try to figure out options
2491818 they might be able to charge a lunch or talk to a teacher life is about problem solving and helping a child understand options teaches them to problem solve what you ultimately want for your child is an independent individual accountable for their actions
2491819 i keep numbers of classmates from the previous year and then my daughter can call them if they havent kept in touch over the summer and find out who might be in her class
2491820 ohio and virginia are the two states that are the cradles of presidents and if people want to get a flavor of ohios presidential legacy this is the place to do it
2491821 people can get a flavor of 19th century living and of how ohio was the crossroads of the nation during that era
2491822 no doubt about that villages that fell under russian invasion those villages are being cleaned out pulling out our troops would lead to more ethnic cleansing by russian troops
2491823 were all ready 4 yr reception u can trust the empire hotel
2491824 better than that anne we can trust the catering manager
2491825 the girls the bookstore provided all the decorations and anthonys mother made the cake
2491826 she is great she is xxactly the kind of woman id want my daughter 2 have 4 a mother in law
2491827 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2491828 tskhinvali and the heights around tskhinvali and the majority of the villages in south ossetia are under the control of georgian forces
2491829 the entire town of tkshinvali is currently controlled by units of south ossetias self defence
2491830 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2491831 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2491832 the only possible way out is the withdrawal of georgian forces to starting positions
2491833 we would never disrespect authority or disrespect brown theres no way in the world
2491834 i just smiled and told the desk agent that it was gods favor
2491835 getting the right loan is still possible even in this stringent market for people with not so good credit
2491836 that is why we have expanded our services to offer assistance in other areas that can help borrowers establish consolidate and fix their credit helping them to get a better rate
2491837 helping people get better credit or establish credit to secure a good loan is something that we are proud to assist with
2491838 many young people are looking to start purchasing in this buyers market but dont know the effects of loans in their credit
2491839 this is why we are now offering assistance with student loans and credit repair

2491856 wajah wajah orang orang mukmin pada hari itu berseri seri kepada tuhannyalah mereka memandang
2491857 bagi orang orang yang berbuat baik ada pahala yang terbaik surga dan tambahannya
2491858 bagi orang orang yang berbuat baik mereka akan mendapatkan al husnaa berarti surga dan ziyaadah berarti melihat allah
2491859 sungguh engkau akan melihat tuhanmu pada yaumul hisab seperti engkau melihat bulan purnama di malam hari engkau tidak akan kesulitan untuk melihatnya
2491860 saya bersaksi bahwa tidak ada tuhan yang berhak disembah kecuali allah dan muhammad adalah utusan allah
2491861 muhammad itu sekali kali bukanlah bapak dari seorang laki laki di antara kamu tetapi dia adalah rasulullah dan penutup nabi nabi
2491862 dan segala kebaikan adalah mengikuti mereka yang datang terlebih dahulu salaf

2491876 kematian adalah sebuah kenyataan keras dan menakutkan yang akan dihadapi tiap tiap yang bernyawa

2491930 ive just turned 32 which in goalkeeping terms is still young so im hoping that my best years are ahead of me you look at brad friedel who has moved to villa at 37 and david james has probably just had the best season of his career at a similar age

2491934 paloschi will play up front and then viudez might replace him hes very talented fast and sharp cardacio has a little more experience hes a midfielder who can play in three positions both can do well with milan if given time
2491935 we knew alonso was a very good player and as a result he had a good price in the transfer market we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2491936 it could be that he does stay with us for me it is not a problem if he stays or not he can stay we always have felt he is a good player
2491937 we are only talking about a very very good price he is a good player if he is not going to bring a good price then it is very simple easy to understand
2491938 theyre a massive club and there is something inside me that just always wants to beat them

2491945 selama bertahun tahun indonesia dibiasakan dengan ekonomi yang sangat sentralistik hal itu menjadi pengaruh di dalam pemusatan stasiun televisi di indonesia
2491946 pemusatan kepemilikan dan penguasaan lembaga penyiaran swasta jasa penyiaran televisi oleh satu orang atau satu badan hukum baik di satu wilayah siatan maupun di beberapa wilayah siaran si seluruh wilayah indonesia dibatasi dengan sebagai berikut a satu badan hukum paling banyak memiliki dua izin penyelenggaraan penyiaran jasa penyiaran televisi yang berlokasi di dua propinsi yang berbeda

2491975 theres anything thats happened in the past 7 1 2 years that the u s needs to apologize for in terms of foreign policy
2491976 no i dont believe in the u s apologizing as i said i think the war in iraq was a mistake we didnt keep our eye on the ball in afghanistan but you know hindsight is 20 20 and im much more interested in looking forward rather than looking backwards
2491977 the invasion of afghanistan was as illegal as the invasion of iraq
2491978 the u n charter provides that all member states must settle their international disputes by peaceful means and no nation can use military force except in self defense or when authorized by the security council after the 9 11 attacks the council passed two resolutions neither of which authorized the use of military force in afghanistan
2491979 the invasion of afghanistan was not legitimate self defense under article 51 of the charter because the attacks on september 11 were criminal attacks not armed attacks by another country afghanistan did not attack the united states in fact 15 of the 19 hijackers came from saudi arabia furthermore there was not an imminent threat of an armed attack on the united states after september 11 or bush would not have waited three weeks before initiating his october 2001 bombing campaign the necessity for self defense must be instant overwhelming leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation this classic principle of self defense in international law has been affirmed by the nuremberg tribunal and the u n general assembly
2491980 iraq has been killed never to rise again the american occupation has been more disastrous than that of the mongols who sacked baghdad in the thirteenth century only fools talk of solutions now there is no solution the only hope is that perhaps the damage can be contained
2491981 its time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put iraq back together and start spending the money putting america back together

2491993 we received a call that someone was smelling fumes in the area and we investigated with the coast guard and found oil in the canal between the power plant and the barrier
2491994 it didnt get into dickinson bayou and was stopped in the canal but there was an impact to coastal waters
2491995 reviewed and approved by senior executives of the corporation including high ranking officers directors and employees
2491996 the corporation was paying the auc and that the auc was a violent paramilitary organization led by carlos casta o
2491997 convivir was merely a front for the auc and described the auc as a widely known illegal vigilante organization
2491998 presented the results of his investigation to the audit committee of the board of directors during a meeting in defendant chiquitas cincinnati headquarters in september 2000
2491999 t hey should be judged in colombia not only for the extortion payments but also for the transport and safekeeping of 3 000 rifles
2492000 there are indeed some chiquita brands directors but we are not able to ask for them in extradition rather we have to have some information contained in the agreement reached with the us court that includes a confidentiality agreement
2492001 when i joined the board i knew the company was making payments to paramilitary groups in colombia
2492002 the killings by jorge 40 have occurred in territories where there are major businesses and enterprises the part of the country with the most common graves after putumayo is the area of ci naga and fundaci n there the attorney generals office has detected more than 300 clandestine graves surrounded by what was a prosperous banana industry which included the participation of the controversial multinational chiquita brands
2492003 last january 16 47 ak 47 rifles which appear to have come from the otterloo ship were confiscated from the don mario organization through the heroes de casta o bloc daniel rend n herrera has taken over the areas of several former paramilitary chiefs and has killed 70 persons close to those who killed his friend carlos casta o since at least a year ago he began to appropriate the drug trafficking markets and military spaces that were previously occupied by the former paras salvatore mancuso diego fernando murillo bejarano don berna and ramiro vanoy murillo aka cuco of the more than 3 thousand 500 rifles from the otterloo the demobilized persons only surrendered a small amount of them to the uribe government within the auc demobilization process the authorities work with the hypothesis that don mario is rearming his army a hybrid between former self defense forces and drug traffickers with the remaining weapons don mario officially appears among the persons that demobilized from the lmer c rdenas bloc then at the command of is younger brother aka el alem n and even though the government has reiterated that those who return to committing crimes automatically lose the benefits of the law of justice and peace no legal mechanism has yet to be enabled for this purpose
2492004 all of the banana companies paid us every one of them t oward the end of 1997 the father of ra l hasb n a banana entrepreneur died in a airplane accident this resulted in a meeting of all the banana companies in which ra l hasb n was named the banana company representative for dealing with the self defense forces following this meeting ra l became the intermediary and later a commander of the bananero bloc chiquita brands inc dole banacol uniban proban and del monte all entered into this agreement they paid us one cent for every box of bananas that left the country the rest of the companies of the sector made a contribution every six months the dole company was in charge of collecting the money and completing the operation the others had full knowledge of the payments which were registered as contributions to the papagayo convivir the sum of these contributions was distributed proportionally among casa casta o the bananero bloc a part for social investment and another to pay off state institutions ra l hasb n explained its workings to jorge 40 who was put in charge of duplicating the process in magdalena the massacres allowed them to take apart the systems of social assistance negotiated with the unions
2492005 t he former paramilitary chief salvatore mancuso assured that the multinational chiquita brands accepted paying the paramilitary groups for their security without there being any threats and he offered to reveal all of the ties between the multinationals with the paramilitaries in colombia no it is not true they were pressured says mancuso they paid taxes because we were like a state in the area and because we were providing them with protection which enabled them to continue making investments and a financial profit explained mancuso additionally the former paramilitary chief assured that chiquita brands was not the only company that agreed to pay the paramilitaries for their security all companies in the banana region paid for instance there was dole and del monte which i believe are u s companies he told the us network
2492006 there wasnt any need to pressure blackmail or threaten the banana companies for them to pay the percentages the truth is we never thought about what would happen because the representatives for the companies did so willingly claimed mancuso
2492007 i t is secret to nobody especially in the area of urab that the multinationals paid these funds through an intermediary of a corporation for the matter of security
2492008 according to our intelligence reports the company used for these shipments is named chiquita
2492009 indicated that ra l hazb n aka pedro bonito or pedro aponte ordered the crimes committed by the self defense forces in the area from 1996 to 2004
2492010 implicated the current mayor of carepa arnulfo pe uela mar n with the convivir associations that operated in the area of urab and with the illegal activities of these groups alias h h declared under oath before the prosecutor from the justice and peace unit that mayor pe uela mar n was a part of the board of directors of one of these convivir and told that these associations were created in urab from 1996 to 1997 by the entrepreneur ra l hasb n who he assured belonged to the self defense forces through the convivir associations the self defense forces charged vacunas payments and extortion from the banana companies in the region of urab among them chiquita brands confessed the former paramilitary chief who commanded the presently demobilized bananero bloc
2492011 resumed testimony before the attorney generals office with new accusations against the ruling class from urab department of antioquia in the proceedings from yesterday he implicated several political leaders from the area in alleged political agreements with the auc in his testimony he also reiterated the ties between the mayor from the municipality of carepa arnulfo pe uela and the auc after the mayor had said he never had a relationship with veloza according to the former chief of the bananero bloc the elected mayor toward the end of the 90s the director of the papagayo convivir accompanied him and another auc commander aka doble cero to meet with senior military commanders on several occasions
2492012 reiterated that the banana companies supported the arrival of the self defense forces to the region to combat the guerrilla he also said that the convivir were created to legalize the payments by the banana companies in order to militarily maintain the illegal group he also stated that in exchange for security the banana companies paid the auc three cents for every box of exported bananas and he admitted they used threats to force banana company employees to work when they organized strikes he also admitted to the murder of banana workers the banana companies never paid us to kill trade unionists but with the money paid to the auc many crimes were clearly committed against workers he stated the paramilitary chief revealed that many of the banana ships were loaded with drugs at several ports scuba divers paid by drug traffickers even fastened some drug laden tubes to the hulls of the ships at high sea to evade the control points of the security agencies every month 4 000 kilos of drugs left from our region to panama and central america asserted veloza garc a
2492013 extraditions should be from here to there usa and from there to here colombia the decision to request them is in the hands of the attorney generals office
2492014 it is certainly a hypocrisy that while here we fight to catch the bandits to extradite them there they make such indignant arrangements
2492015 we hope the attorney generals office carries out the corresponding investigations that they ask for all the information we should request the attorney general to look into this issue an interpol red notice for some of the senior executives of multinationals makes their life uncomfortable at least they wont be able to leave the country
2492016 from a formal point of view the us justice system has some parameters that deserve all of our respect however this does not mean that the public is not somewhat perplexed that such an important case does not result in anyone going to jail
2492017 naturally they may be prosecuted in colombia what we are seeing here is a judicial case that has gone before american courts in which colombia has not had any participation
2492018 the ministry of foreign affairs lets it be known that if the conduct of officials from the banana company chiquita brands classifies as any crime in colombia with the support of the attorney generals office we will request the extradition of these persons to the country
2492019 the government is analyzing the possibility that the unit in charge of the nations legal defense advises the victims of paras in urab and magdalena so the executives from chiquita brands may be held responsible in colombia
2492020 this is governed by international law standards that are in force in both countries there is the possibility that colombia asks for us citizens in extradition just as the united states may ask for nationals
2492021 the agreement is unbecoming of the us justice system because it creates the sensation that impunity may be bought for a few million dollars
2492022 it makes no sense that a transnational buys impunity for 25 million dollars either here or anywhere
2492023 with these funds terrorist groups have put our homeland into mourning they should face justice
2492024 i think chiquita escaped any kind of appropriate sanctions we will take a good hard look at how american multinationals operate around the world using colombia as a model it really deserves an exhaustive effort to examine where we need legislation and if there are gaps in our criminal code that allow u s corporations to aid or abet violence in other countries that erode our credibility and our moral standing in the world do our economic interests trump the war on terror are we making trade offs if we are at the very least the public should know about it
2492025 up to now the colombian government has not spoken with us about any extradition and we would have to follow our extradition treaty to the letter
2492026 chiquitas position is that the payments were made for protection so they would not be attacked during the time of their presence in colombia this justification is not acceptable
2492027 i hope that this the extradition of the chiquita directors is not a problem between the two governments i have no reason to believe it would be because in the end the two governments and the two countries have the same objective and desire to eliminate the activities of the violent groups
2492028 i do not doubt in the slightest that there will be collaboration in accordance with our formal obligations and the excellent bilateral relationship we enjoy
2492029 there is no criminal investigation at a preliminary or investigative stage where the mentioned citizen appears as a complainant or defendant

2492041 i can assure you the person will be acceptable to the dalit community

2492070 egypts muslim brotherhood provides an example of the goals and methods of centrist islamism this group and egypts radicals share the long term goal of implementing sharia quranic law as the basis of national law the brotherhood however has committed itself to working within the current egyptian system to achieve this objective and renounces at least in its official statements the violent tactics of militant splinter groups
2492071 first it sought to gain properly elected representation in the egyptian parliament largely through coalitions with other small opposition parties second it has taken control of professional and student associations the most prominent private organizations in the country again through proper electoral process finally it has established a network of social services in neighborhoods and villages these initiatives fill gaps in government services creating an enormous degree of popular support for the brotherhood without directly challenging the government
2492072 the brotherhood promotes freedom of speech the independence of unions and professional organizations transparency of government transactions a crackdown on corruption and freedom for political prisoners the brotherhood is not pressing for islamic oriented social changes such as mandatory use of veils by women or a ban on alcohol
2492073 the palestinian cause was not solved not because the muslims cant solve it but because they dont want to solve it and they dont want because they dont feel this is because they are fake muslims
2492074 the brotherhoods conservative older members who joined the group in the 1950s and 1960s are heavily influenced by their experiences with political repression many of these brothers who spent time in prison because of their ikhwan affiliation are wary and secretive they are well educated doctrinaire and unwilling to budge on the issue of israel this older generation dislikes cooperation with other groups maintains a separation from the general public and opposes the formation of a muslim brotherhood based political party
2492075 the younger members of the muslim brotherhood are pragmatic and reformist having joined the organization in the 1970s and 1980s these individuals do not have prison experience they were molded not by oppression but by their experiences in syndicate board elections the younger generation not given to secrecy tends to support the foundation of a muslim brotherhood political party
2492076 al tilimsani noted that the revolutionary groups al jihad and al takfir wal hijra had called the brotherhood infidels and claimed it had renounced jihad
2492077 the brotherhood views revolutionary groups as offshoots of its movement and ideology that have mistakenly taken up violence

2492109 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2492117 there are two problems here one is personal and he and his family will have to work that out and the other is that he apparently lied repeatedly about this
2492118 its tragic for elizabeth and the kids as a serious political candidate it would be very hard for him to be that again or to have a major job in government the lying is a big part of that
2492119 my observation was that he seemed very sincere it never ceases to amaze me how often this happens

2492138 you mean the article 9 of the constitution of japan
2492139 when was the capital of japan moved from kyoto to edo
2492140 these other folks also liked pink laces and green stitching
2492141 the whole idea is to make it easy for people to come in and get involved and not have to drive far to find an office
2492142 we are campaigning all across maine and our goal is to get democrats elected up and down the ticket
2492143 there is a distinction between what we are doing and the democrats are doing were very heavily volunteer driven and oriented toward local jurisdictions down to the precinct level
2492144 our strategy is just fundamentally different than theirs we look closely at the electoral map and determine what resources to deploy in those areas we have a fundamental and philosophical approach to how we plan to win
2492145 because it has failed to listen to people who know how to run services on behalf of the customer rather than the producer
2492146 public services have requirements placed upon them by a whole series of bodies that are all based on opinion rather than knowledge
2492147 what people want from public services is for them to work properly waste can be eradicate if the systems are properly designed against demand rather than phoney outcomes
2492148 tax breaks are absolutely what is needed to keep london alive as a film capital because we are facing competition not just from california but the eastern european countries as well

2492154 one of the most egregiously self serving political stunts in living memory
2492155 his party at risk for the sake of a disastrous ego trip
2492156 more about one mans misguided impulses than the good of his party
2492157 so although mr daviss motives may be suspect the vanity palpable the distraction unhelpful i am not quite confident that this is how the voters will read the story
2492158 the party that is first to let the voters know what it really stands for loses
2492159 after the 2005 election david cameron deliberately shifted his party closer to the position of the government this was the same move that tony blair had made before the 1997 election in both cases they concluded that a broadly moderate centre position was superior as an electoral strategy and governing philosophy they sacrificed definition by reducing the differences with their opponents but regarded the trade offs as worthwhile and they were surely right
2492160 the contrast principle kicked in and voters understood the position for the first time
2492161 my gut instinct is that this goes against the sort of nhs i believe in which is free at the point of use fair and equitable for all
2492162 without a shadow of doubt that the german system is in all respects incomparably better german hospitals waiting lists whats a waiting list
2492163 new laws on maternity leave have had the unintended consequences of increasing the disparity between the time mothers and fathers spend with their children
2492164 no one is suggesting that women should not have the rights they have to maternity leave what we are saying is that dads need a slice of the action too
2492165 the 2 7 billion tax cut financed by borrowing was a response to the world economic downturn a measure to stimulate domestic growth by putting extra money in peoples pockets brown said he wanted to ease the financial squeeze being faced by hard working families
2492166 this is a prime minister who will do anything anything to cling to power
2492167 the british left has never had a problem in principle with intervention coercion or prescription why would they to the leftist mind impressed with the possibilities of collective action channelled into statist structures for the purposes of increasing the sum total of human happiness at gunpoint the idea of wading into the middle east to sort things out was always going to have an instinctive appeal
2492168 put canary wharf on the map get crossrail built get roads built get decent healthcare for those who are poor and chronically sick underwrite and arrange free and universal schooling protect us abroad wow and police us at home force the pace on climate change frame amend and administer the law defend the interest of the generality against the appetites of individuals create a national park guarantee a green belt hold back the march of a million breeze block bungalows across the countryside redistribute wealth and power
2492169 the environment the regulation of banking fair trade malaria and hiv aids congestion immigration asylum what has anti statism to say about any of these i cannot remember a time when the ideas of hayek joseph and sherman all seemed more distant to the anxieties of the hour
2492170 the far greater depressions and inflations of the twentieth century have not educed nearly as much mass interest in economics as did the milder economic crises of the past century
2492171 the founders of bretton woods resolved that the failed policies of laissez faire which resulted in vast inequities and recurring depression from the 1870s to the 1930s would not be repeated unregulated market forces had brought great instability and even greater injustice in the post war era governments had to work collectively
2492172 the incidence of banking crises has been as high since 1980 as in any period since 1800
2492173 get government schools and government education out of the way its history syllabus and lessons are bunk
2492174 to detain suspected terrorists without charge for up to 42 days
2492175 today in britain there are at least 2 000 terrorist suspects 200 networks or cells and 30 active plots
2492176 they the police have to make a judgement about intervening early to avert tragedy which means more time may be needed between arrests and charges being laid to unravel the conspiracy and assemble the evidence
2492177 so our first principle is that there should always be a maximum limit of pre charge detention it is fundamental to our civil liberties that no one should be held arbitrarily for an unspecified period
2492178 our second principle is that detention beyond 28 days why 28 gordo can be allowed only in truly exceptional circumstances the decision must be backed by the director of public prosecutions as well as the police
2492179 our third principle is that the home secretary must them take this decision to parliament for approval
2492180 fourthly a senior judge will be required to approve the extension of detention in each individual case every seven days
2492181 fifthly the independent reviewer will now report publicly not just in general on the operation of the legislation but on each individual case
2492182 after seven years and now faced with a long us electoral season the doha round of talks intended to introduce a new era of freer trade with fewer barriers between countries now faces a very uncertain future but we can be sure of one thing we would all have been winners from a doha deal without one we all lose
2492183 it is not just ethics that should make us hostile to bribery but economic reality the payment of inducements skews the cost advantages of the lowest prices
2492184 in order to be ethical the company will have to stop making facilitation payments effectively bungs to government officials in other countries
2492185 this was probably the hardest bout i fenced in my career but you know i did what i had to do
2492186 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2492187 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2492188 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2492189 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2492190 if the election is close it could come down to small demographic changes in some areas
2492191 the result was my best effort i was able to get medals in five consecutive meets and i am happy about that
2492192 im very happy even though some people are quite uneasy but i am satisfied and this time i just wanted to win a medal
2492193 this has been a dream of mine for such a long time
2492194 the judges make the calls and i cant do anything about that
2492195 i am so appreciative my dream has come true here and its because of all of the fans that came to cheer me on i was able to reach my goal because of all of my efforts
2492196 it ended before i knew it i really didnt have any power i wasnt nervous at all but i needed to be more aggressive earlier i wasnt able get into a groove
2492197 higher cancer rates are also found in carrigaline ringaskiddy and passage monkstown but cobh urban is by far the worst and it is widely believed that this is a result of its proximity to the former plant
2492198 locals had regularly raised fears about the potential of carcinogenic and hazardous chemicals being present in the local water over the years but were regularly reassured that there was nothing to be concerned about it now turns out that the people of cobh and former workers had their health seriously put at risk

2492216 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2492217 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2492218 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2492219 i got a house in bath that we go to for holidays and weekends and the father of a girl who works for me there is headmaster at this matravers school
2492220 he asked me if i would open a drama centre so i went there and there was a plaque for the drama centre that had paul weiland on it

2492225 if i wanted publicity id be accepting invitations not to mention money for turning up to glamorous events
2492226 how can i dare to dream when i dont even have time to think my own thoughts
2492227 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2492228 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2492229 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2492230 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2492231 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2492232 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops

2492243 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents
2492244 the citys transportation and infrastructure development have failed to catch up with the citys growing population which has exceeded 8 million causing severe traffic jams and degrading environment
2492245 in that spirit we call on both georgia and south ossetia to exercise restraint put an immediate end to military activities strictly observe the agreement on non resumption of hostilities and renew direct talks aimed at finding a comprehensive and durable solution to the situation and preventing its relapses
2492246 my delegation once again calls upon the parties to exercise restraint renounce the use of force and expeditiously resume direct dialogue to end the hostilities
2492247 we will continue to work with the other council members to ensure that the council has a timely response to the current dramatic developments in the south ossetian zone of conflict with a view to de escalating tension and bringing the parties to the negotiating table

2492260 real estate is cyclical in nature in vancouver and victoria i dont think theyve had any type of correction in more than 20 years
2492261 there is a chance things will settle down that there will be more listings on the market and that prices and growth will ease the next year or so
2492262 our conclusions show that we think weve peaked in terms of the housing valuations and were in a period of sustained decline going forward
2492263 as people buy fewer homes well also expect them to buy fewer of the things that go into new homes for example drapes and furniture and things like that
2492264 in the u s a flexible credit plan allowed many people to buy homes who otherwise wouldnt be able to afford it

2492281 clearly these exclusions represent some diminishment in the coverage of the population but because of the practical difficulties involved in attempting to reach the institutionalized population it is a compromise gallup usually needs to make

2492286 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward

2492304 id like to treat you gentlemen to an enchanted tale about venusian dining but first im afraid you must hear of the horrors of saturnian cuisine
2492305 i was an immigrant truck driver in new jersey delivering pies all over old newark
2492306 this one time i stayed on mimas for a week i asked my host to take me out to enjoy a traditional meal of his people
2492307 now you gotta understand my mood going into this i sat down at a round table elbow to elbow with a dozen smelly mimasians all grabbing at the food in communal bowls with their bare hands
2492308 a couple of years later the company let me bring a friend to rhea to program the computer at the then new cybele spaceport so i took john and as kent knows
2492309 afterwards i took john aside and scolded him about rejecting their food
2492310 well i also i recall making the mistake of inviting john to come with me to venus
2492311 at the most popular restaurant in town we sat a dozen deep at the nicest table they could offer with a giant bay window over looking the harbor and a saffron early afternoon sea
2492312 he squeezed in in his finger tips and it warped like a water balloon
2492313 i picked one up and held it in my fingertips squeezing it a little to test its elasticity
2492314 with a shaking hand he picked up the closest squishy egg made a carefully though jittery incision and without hesitation picked up the red sauce having the same idea the i had to scorch his taste buds off
2492315 our little europan host had been flirting with a new employee and had only tuned in halfway through and had chosen a poor time to finish his beer when he at last sipped it all it and sat it down he exclaimed down the table oh no john you got a

2492356 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2492357 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2492358 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2492359 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2492360 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2492361 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2492362 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2492363 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2492452 literature by women about families always has these larger considerations
2492453 with years of studying texts it becomes almost second nature to look beneath the surface at social and economic forces gender relationships and how they are played out in an arena that in my writing happens to be the home but then all sorts of things happening outside do affect what is happening inside the home
2492454 in my work i aim to show rather than tell
2492455 when there was this idea that india was just not a place to be i n you had to get out nobody could get anywhere here its something i grew up with too kapur herself studied in halifax for a few years in the early 1970s but unlike many migrating indians of the time she did return and we all have family and friends who have had those nri experiences of course once i had the period and setting ready i had to have some kind of crisis
2492456 in this case i didnt want nina to get pregnant and then i had to have a reason for that baby is out why is baby out infertility wasnt enough of a reason and i didnt want anything as extreme as impotence there was more dramatic potential in a lingering dissatisfaction which led me to anandas sexual problem
2492457 that one word meanders inspired me to cut 30 000 words from the manuscript
2492458 rushdie i tried to write like that but in my hands it seemed inauthentic and laboured and so i gave it up intuitively i took the raasta of not standing between the reader and the story i wanted to make it as transparent and seamless as possible
2492459 and lots of other stuff i thought was very innovative but it all had to go eventually
2492460 its hard for me to see writing as a social stepping stone
2492461 its such a solitary activity whereas being in society means being gregarious of course younger people have more energy and if they can party and write good for them but if it interferes with your writing i would say just dont do it as a writer you have to serve your art old fashioned as it may sound and personally i do this by not meeting anyone
2492462 but it might be interesting to see what its all about my maids daughter works at a call centre i know a lot of young people who do and i am all for anything that promotes reading among people who arent habitual readers its a wonderful habit it encourages introspection and thinking
2492463 not just to keep up with contemporary fiction but also to expose yourself to what words can do to remind yourself that theres always a new goal to reach
2492464 having had a few books published im more confident with my writing now
2492465 and it had become difficult to write and work at the same time
2492466 during holidays i would do the huge revisions shaping tightening trying to bring together everything in my head during term time when my head was full of teaching i would work on first drafts you need to put down those words in the first place that would be easier to do to come home and just write 500 or 1 000 words that could subsequently be modified but the fashioning or making the thing into an artistic coherent whole
2492467 improve the effectiveness of government institutions rather than stripping them of their tasks
2492468 and policy makers cannot always know how the market will function without them
2492469 in too many cases the division of labour in public private partnerships has put profits in private hands and risks in the public lap
2492470 seems to depend heavily on whether the economy is diversified its capital markets mature and its financial institutions strong
2492471 the fact that capital controls may be leaky and imperfect does not seem a decisive argument against them
2492472 we need to ask why the world bank marshalled 4 million to convene a commission of 21 experts when so much experience exists and the literature is already widely available on each issue that the report visits the report does not say more than a bit of this and a bit of that in a strange mix of orthodoxy and heterodoxy
2492473 experts help as long as there are useful general principles such as could be established by comparing low growth and high growth countries the growth commission correctly pointed out that such an attempt to find secrets to growth has failed the growth commission concluded that answers had to be country specific and even period specific the logical next step at this point would have been to give up on experts
2492474 it is absolutely amazing we made history today i am proud of myself as well as sada and becca

2492644 that would bring their write offs in line with current expenses
2492645 best of all it would accomplish the goal of increasing their write offs always desirable since this would cut their tax bill

2492669 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2492671 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2492672 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2492673 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2492783 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote

2492786 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties

2492796 a plus point was the chief selector was there i hadnt done as well as id wanted to in the indian premier league so i knew this tournament was an important opportunity it was pressure to have the chairman watching me against tough opposition but once i started doing well i grew more confident about my batting
2492797 dilip sir asked me to keep doing what i do i knew he had been observing me for sometime now and i hope i can live up to his expectations

2492828 i got stuck behind watching valverde im disappointed but i cant complain the race was very tough
2492829 i told my small team before the race to follow the big countries

2492924 light is always costly and comes at the expense of that which produces it an unlit candle does not shine for burning must come before the light and we can be of little use to others without a cost to ourselves burning suggests suffering and we try to avoid pain we tend to feel we are doing the greatest good in the world when we are strong and fit for active duty and when our hearts and hands are busy with kind acts of service therefore when we are set aside to suffer when we are sick when we are consumed with pain and when all our activities have stopped we feel we are no longer of any use and are accomplishing nothing yet if we will be patient and submissive it is almost certain we will be a greater blessing to the world around us during our time of suffering and pain than we were when we thought we were doing our greatest work then we are burning and shining brightly as a result of the fire many people want the glory without the cross and the shining light without the burning fire but crucifixion comes before coronation

2493044 city have good individual players at the back especially in dunne and richards
2493045 they need to keep that understanding and continue their progression from last season
2493046 every good team has that bedrock of a solid back four
2493047 if you had said 10 or 15 years ago that mark hughes would one day manage manchester city i dont think anyone would have taken you seriously
2493048 mark was a united icon as a player but he has made a big impression as a manager elsewhere
2493049 he did well with wales almost getting them to euro 2004 and then he created a team at blackburn who have become a mainstay of the premier league
2493050 its easy to forget now that blackburn were in a bit of trouble when he took over but he led them to sixth place a couple of years ago and to seventh last season
2493051 hes learned about management very quickly and hes earned his spurs
2493052 now hes joined a fantastic club and i hope his career continues
2493053 can city realistically challenge the top six this season no the year after theyve got a chance
2493054 theyve got a new manager with new ideas its about getting the club to bounce the way he wants it to bounce
2493055 so a top ten finish this coming season would have to be seen as a success
2493056 we finished fifth in 1992 and then ninth in 1993
2493057 but then the rot set in and unfortunately there was a decline
2493058 there were well documented shenanigans and mismanagement behind the scenes which filtered through to the playing side and that had a disastrous effect
2493059 we had a fantastic response from the players last season we were second or third from bottom when neil came in and we ended up making the play offs
2493060 it didnt quite happen for us when we got there as we were beaten by bristol city but we gave a good account of ourselves
2493061 the standards have been set for this season and if we get that little bit of luck we wont be far away
2493062 if youre asking for one word to describe neil it would be unique
2493063 dont be fooled by what you see on the camera hes a very professional diligent intelligent football person
2493064 sometimes his passions can overspill but hes a winner and he wants people around him who like winning
2493065 he likes players to be proud of the club they play for as a member of staff you cant ask for more than that

2493074 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2493075 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2493076 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2493077 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2493078 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2493079 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world

2493081 some of the best parenting ive seen comes out of washington
2493082 in california and the midwest they just give in and say thats the way it is here you see parents still struggling to be great parents and i havent seen that in any other region
2493083 they say im glad a man did it because if a woman did it no man would have come to see it
2493084 i asked all of them do you feel attractive do you feel beautiful all but two of them said no
2493085 if this makes you feel bad why dont you stop reading them they said they couldnt i realized theres some kind of addiction or comfort they get from this
2493086 america the beautiful is not shrill or alarmist nor does it strain to shock us darryl roberts its director and narrator speaks in a pleasant low key voice but the film is pulsing with barely suppressed rage and by the end i shared it
2493087 these are a bunch of guys who are desensitized who just dont care i do believe this film means something totally different to women 18 to 30 than it does to a man 50 to 60
2493088 we kind of put our little toe in gingerly because weve never done anything like this before
2493089 should spark not only a national conversation but a cultural shift
2493090 the industry is not going to stop doing what theyre doing

2493104 as we felt new power flow in as we enjoyed peace of mind as we discovered we could face life successfully as we became conscious of his presence we began to lose our fear of today tomorrow or the hereafter we were reborn
2493105 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life

2493120 this is a parish that does exactly what the holy father tells us to do celebrating the mass reverently in the old and new forms the bishop is determined to squash it and to destroy me because he doesnt want me moving to another parish and doing the same thing
2493121 the bishop believes your ministry to be divisive is uncertain that ordinary pastoral care of parishioners is taking place and does not have confidence that you will celebrate the ordinary form of the mass with a generous heart for the vast majority of parishioners who expect sunday and weekday masses to be in english and at an altar facing the people

2493146 by and large politics has taken a holiday in oregon this summer theres been no bickering legislature overstaying its welcome in salem no warring gubernatorial candidates and precious few sightings of the presidential candidates who rarely deviate from the iowa new hampshire south carolina circuit but once labor day is over and the barbecues stowed safely away the political volume will be turned way up as two controversial measures slated for the nov 6 statewide ballot take center stage
2493147 the issue is two pronged for local rural firefighters in addition to possible growth within their boundaries firefighters say they may also face accessibility problems with new homes built in forest settings as they work through the height of this years fire season payne said plenty of homes in his area already stand tucked away along the wilderness edge making it more difficult for firefighters to reach them easily
2493148 as the fire season in the willamette valley moves into the september home stretch and as oregon voters prepare to vote this fall on a proposed legislative rewrite of measure 37 its worth reflecting briefly on the severe burden that the property rights law could create for firefighters in rural areas throughout the valley and entire state long before oregon voters approved measure 37 in 2004 increasing rural development created complications and forced strategy changes for the federal state and local agencies charged with fighting wildfires now measure 37 threatens to compound those problems by allowing an unprecedented construction boom in many isolated rural areas across the state
2493149 lets face it bernie mac was one of a kind he was the best of the best in terms of giving you a good laugh

2493151 measure 49 actually hurts surviving spouses it does not help them
2493152 2 if the claimant is the surviving spouse of a person who was the owner of the property in fee title the claimants acquisition date is the date the claimant was married to the deceased spouse of the date the spouse acquired the property whichever is later
2493153 if the claimant is the surviving spouse of a person who was an owner of the property in fee title the claimants acquisition date is the date the claimant was married to the deceased spouse or the date the spouse acquired the property whichever is later a claimant or a surviving spouse may disclaim the relief provided under sections 5 to 22 of this 2007 act by using the procedure provided in ors 105 623 to 105 649
2493154 this hypothetical will help you understand how measure 49 works
2493155 if the claimant is the surviving spouse of a person who was an owner of the property in fee title the claimants acquisition date is the date the claimant was married to the deceased spouse or the date the spouse acquired the property whichever is later
2493156 in 1980 husband adds wifes name to the deed to the property
2493157 if the claimant is the surviving spouse of a person who was an owner of the property in fee title the claimants acquisition date is the date the claimant was married to the deceased spouse or the date the spouse acquired the property whichever is later
2493158 2 if the claimant is the surviving spouse of a person who was the owner of the property in fee title the claimants acquisition date is the date the claimant was married to the deceased spouse of the date the spouse acquired the property whichever is later
2493159 two of the most common misleading statements include measure 49 repeals measure 37 and measure 49 guts measure 37 the first is totally false and the second is only partially true and depends upon your point of view
2493160 measure 49 does not repeal 37 it attempts to correct its flaws
2493161 measure 37 allows the overriding of existing land use and zoning laws on high value farmlands forest lands and groundwater restricted lands it permits large subdivisions commercial developments such as strip malls and industrial developments such as gravel pits on these sites measure 49 prohibits these overrides
2493162 all his life has he looked away never his mind on where he was what he was doing

2493164 seven thousand five hundred claims for development involving 750 000 acres of oregon land results of measure 37 this november we can fix the abuse of our land while adding fairness to processing the just requests of property owners measure 49 balances property owners rights and the need to protect farmland forests and water supply
2493165 who benefits most from measure 37 it turns out to be a relatively small group of wealthy people who propose large developments on farm and forestlands
2493166 the thing that sold google on the dalles was land use planning
2493167 they came to this area knowing we had protections the dalles and wasco county would not become another concrete haven
2493168 state director russell hoeflich acknowledged that the nature conservancy does not typically get involved in political campaigns but he called measure 37 a fundamental attack on oregons land use system in this case after evaluating the impact of measure 37 on clean water supplies and on working farms and forests we decided to join the broad coalition of business leaders farm organizations conservation groups and others in supporting measure 49 hoeflich said the state groups board of trustees unanimously supported taking a leadership role in the campaign he said and the national and international organizations approved the action
2493169 the breadth of stimsons development plans shocked many observers when just before a measure 37 filing deadline last year the portland based company filed claims to develop 36 000 acres of timber land throughout the county including several near the companys mill just east of hagg lake since then the company has pursued the claim on iowa hill a sprawling tract of timber land along dixon mill and iowa hill roads
2493170 measure 49 and what the legislators passed is just directly from the extreme environmental groups
2493171 chairman of the seven member commission that oversees the department john vanlandingham said theres no timeline for choosing a new director some involved in the recruitment process have suggested waiting until november when measure 49 is decided the measure would revise and limit property development rights extended under measure 37 others want to hire someone sooner
2493172 the oregonian along with gov ted kulongoski and other government officials is supporting measure 49 they think that those of us who voted for measure 37 were confused and misinformed they showcase only a few examples of what measure 37 could lead to but dont inform you about the majoritys circumstances
2493173 when measure 37 passed there was hope even though we wanted only six lots the county told us we could not divide our property one lot at a time and to file for the maximum allowed 46 lots we say this because some people are nervous about the number and size of measure 37 claims those numbers are not accurate we only wanted six rural residential lots but on paper our claim is for 46 lots
2493174 in 2004 proponents of measure 37 lied to oregonians they trumpeted its protection of individual property rights but did not mention that it was supported by timber companies and mega developers so that they could build large subdivisions the full consequences of measure 37 were not disclosed and now voters want a change

2493196 measure 49 was developed by the legislature after months of testimony it was a compromise it accomplishes what the voters thought they were voting for when they voted for measure 37 allowing qualified property owners to build a few houses on their land it adds protection of water availability and gives some protections to the neighbors of claimants shelton state that measure 49 to be voted on nov 6 wipes out every measure 37 claim this is totally false

2493345 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2493346 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2493347 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2493348 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2493349 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2493356 journalist killings are never a laughing matter there is no joke in it we respect him as a good comedian his job to entertain has limits however and bragging about an old lady who could kill journalists is way beyond his turf he stepped over and he should apologize not only to the families of journalists who died but to those who lived to see him make his jokes he should apologize to the thousands of journalists he insulted
2493357 no one should be allowed to toy with the issue of journalist killings much less play jokes about it we might file a formal protest before the movie and television review and classification board mtrcb unless he apologizes to those he insulted we would ask the mtrcb to at least suspend him or the program
2493358 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2493370 but there are restraints and we do not approve of them setting the tone of mainstream society
2493371 they live their lives thats their personal space but the tone of the overall society i think it remains conventional it remains straight and we want it to remain so
2493372 we were right to uphold the family unit when western countries went for experimental lifestyles in the 1960s the hippies free love
2493373 but im glad we did that because today if you look at western europe the marriage as an institution is dead families have broken down the majority of children are born out of wedlock and live in families where the father and the mother are not husband and wife living together bringing them up

2493422 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2493423 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2493424 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2493425 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2493426 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal

2493446 demand more than a polite relationship with jesus and his church
2493447 he is our lord and god what he deserves is our love a love that is expressed in our worship in our service to others and in our obedience to the church
2493448 the kind of radical love expressed in obedience an obedience that can make our hearts ache and bruise our vanity is the seed of renewal in every age of the church
2493449 i entered religious life because i wanted to be one of those seeds because i knew my own happiness depended on it i am sure you want to be those seeds of renewal too
2493450 everything the catholic church offers in the way of its sacramental rituals and moral and doctrinal teachings is an obstacle to having a relationship with god
2493451 getting women religious to follow the lead of progressive theologians in renewing themselves into virtual oblivion
2493452 many of the active remnant are among the most aggressively disaffected groups in the church and some publicly declare that the vocation of their community is to go out of business
2493453 the church belongs to christ the church is his spouse and we find his peace through love and obedience to his church which is finally not an institution or corporation or bureaucracy but our mother and teacher
2493454 a difficult crisis due to the aging of members a more or less accentuated fall in vocations and sometimes a spiritual and charismatic weariness

2493490 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2493491 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2493492 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2493493 im used as cannon fodder they said send the old bugger out there first and see what happens

2493498 the undertaking was meant to identify problems and address areas where law enforcement is weak to ensure a hundred percent conviction particularly in high profile cases reyes said
2493499 this is to show our commitment and seriousness in pursuing criminals who have expensive lawyers to argue their case he added
2493500 cases are usually dismissed for technicality and among those cited as examples were markings of the evidence cases should be airtight and investigators must give more attention to details reyes said
2493501 with proper equipment and the present technology it should now be easier to pin down suspects in court he added

2493508 the whole question has to do with whether its possible to generate high dielectric materials that maintain high dielectric constants like 20 or 30k up to high field strengths the question is whether you can whether its physically possible to have a material that will maintain its very high dielectric constant at very high fields and the consensus of all the experts that ive talked to in the field say that its not possible
2493509 richard weir has chosen to not make available any test data which contradicts what the experts say
2493510 all you have to do to convince anybody is put together a small device and test it at various voltages and you see what happens to the capacitance

2493516 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

2493550 unfortunately althout i know there are legitimately people out there that gleamed some actual benefit to having their website in the rotator i believe they are few and far between as compared with the total number of members
2493551 you should see so and sos restaurant widget site great site went there great bargains food electronics
2493552 my opinion above post i have met many members and i havent met one yet that actually looks at the websites for shopping purposes
2493553 my opinion above post i have met many members and i havent met one yet that actually looks at the websites
2493554 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

2493558 the lord told me its flat none of your business
2493559 peter lawwell chief executive is looking after tying up the loose ends
2493560 my part comes when he joins us and we try to make him a better player and anybody who joins us will hopefully make us a better team
2493561 were all optimistic with just a touch of pessimism because theres always the threat of something going wrong
2493562 its not part of my psyche i have enough to concentrate on here
2493563 we had a good pre season and the players are lively and fit but im always glad when we get the friendlies out of the way i dont enjoy them as much because theyre not competitive
2493564 you know i was sent off five times in friendlies and only once in 832 competitive games which may tell you something
2493565 what keeps me motivated now i enjoy coaching being with the players and training i love to see them celebrating winning games and trophies thats the best thing for me
2493566 as far as this season goes i cant ask the players for any more in the way of character thats been tested
2493567 physically theyre getting better and better so what im looking for is a greater ability to pass the ball 10 or 15 yards its a priceless asset
2493568 we tried one or two things abroad and that will help us in our own european campaign but we will play 4 4 2 against st mirren
2493569 i think fans like us playing that way and we feel comfortable that way
2493570 we have two strikers who scored 50 goals a season so you try to find a system that compliments your best parts
2493571 what happened to rangers in midweek has no bearing on how we will approach this game
2493572 the attitude of the players in pre season has been excellent although quite a few of them have had the bad luck to pick up knocks and if we play the way we can play then rangers will know theyve been in a game

2493577 e quel tipo di giocatore duttile che ha corsa forza fisica tecnica e quindi diventa di facile collocazione un po quella che la nostra filosofia di squadra
2493578 e vero la societ sta trattando julio baptista ma non c ancora niente di fondato
2493579 crediamo che le potenzialit di baptista ci facciano comodo e la societ lo sta trattando ha spiegato lallenatore romanista ma con tutta tranquillit aspettandosi che possa succedere di tutto si cercher di portare a compimento un discorso di completamento di rosa ma bisogna imparare a rafforzare il concetto di squadra cercheremo di prendere dei calciatori importanti che sanno fare la differenza baptista interessa e il d s prad ne sta parlando poi c da vedere se ci riuscir a portarlo a roma
2493580 stiamo parlando anche di altri calciatori ha aggiunto spalletti bisogna vedere un numero di elementi per farsi trovare pronti se una trattativa non andasse a termine
2493581 e quel tipo di giocatore duttile che ha corsa forza fisica tecnica e quindi diventa di facile collocazione un po quella che la nostra filosofia di squadra dellessere duttili a interpretare pi ruoli questo ci ha portato benefici e di conseguenza se inserendo un giocatore che ha queste stesse caratteristiche ci d pi soluzioni e non ci impone di usarlo in una maniera sola
2493582 quando si fa una trattativa spesso vengono accostati i costi le parti responsabilizzate sulla trattativa in generale se una societ lo vuole dare si lima qualcosa per andare incontro al giocatore si fanno valutazioni che vengono addizionate e rese comuni

2493590 is getting real old the phillies need to quit making excuses for their inconsistant play someone needs to take responsability for these scoring lulls and if the players arent going to do it it needs to be management be it
2493591 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
2493592 esto no nos tiene que sorprender si algo hay en el mundo que ha cambiado es el concepto y el sentido de la democracia la revoluci n bolivariana es 100 por ciento m s participativa que la democracia norteamericana

2493623 o presidente georgiano mikhail saakashvili tomou uma decis o muito arriscada de lan ar durante a madrugada de sexta feira uma ofensiva militar contra a regi o da oss tia do sul apoiada por moscou

2493678 the challenge for many networked embedded systems is there is no way to distinguish critical packets from the large volume of non essential ethernet traffic
2493679 ethernet packets are processed on a first come first served basis important packets are left to wait while the packets that arrived ahead of them are processed for embedded systems this leads to systems that are not responsive or worse fail to meet essential deadlines
2493680 previously such sophisticated packet processing was only available in much larger and costlier systems

2493700 shes a very courageous woman shell work through adversity and go on
2493701 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2493702 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2493703 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2493704 have a profound impact on his ability to go forward with a public life
2493705 i hope that in the long run people will remember the good things he did
2493706 one of the very strong pieces of john edwards was his relationship with his wife
2493707 he was seen as the kind of husband that a lot of men would like to be in those situations and that a lot of wives would like to have he became a model husband in that circumstance
2493708 this is the kind of thing that is really gut wrenching
2493709 what if he had won the nomination what kind of mess would that have put this party in
2493710 i decided independently to help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to conduct a normal life
2493711 john edwards was not aware that assistance was provided to anyone involved in this matter i did it of my own volition and without the knowledge instruction or suggestion of john edwards or anyone else the assistance was offered and accepted without condition
2493712 i think furious would be a good way to describe it

2493729 very soon mud is planning to begin full scale operation of high powered wells in its massive new platte west well field located in western douglas county
2493730 if mud begins full operation at this time it will place the drinking water of the omaha area at risk
2493731 we now know the threat is not actually contained and it is clear the corps doesnt know how far east the contamination extends
2493732 in light of this it is far too risky for mud to operate its massive new well field at this time
2493733 the permit issued to mud by the corps in 2003 acknowledges that the pumping could cause the contamination to move and get into the drinking water
2493734 instead of instructing mud to delay operations until the toxins are contained they are allowing mud to proceed
2493735 theyll let us know if there are any problems and if there are they will be corrected
2493736 it is very troubling that the corps continues to refuse to test all the residential wells in the vicinity of the eastern plume
2493737 the public does not have a network of monitoring wells that could serve as an effective early warning system to alert them when muds pumping draws the contamination farther east
2493738 neither the state nor the epa has conducted a study of the effect of muds maximum pumping reported to be at 160 million gallons per day when the stream flow in the platte river is low
2493739 neither have they conducted any independent groundwater modeling related to the mead superfund site toxins
2493740 conservatives are the ones who are tongue tied as demonstrated by sen john mccains limping message free presidential campaign

2494082 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2494083 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2494084 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2494085 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal

2494094 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents

2494165 i grew up as a small town boy in north carolina came from nothing worked very hard dreamed that i could do something helpful for other people with my life became a lawyer through a lot of work and success i got some acclaim as a lawyer

2494334 just a continuation of the growing nature of steaming media
2494335 weve been policing this with the march madness spikes you get in the states but obviously this is on a grander scale its happening over a longer time scale during the work week and its the first time theres been this type of capability so were in uncharted areas to some degree
2494336 its hard to give you fixed numbers but in some past cases streaming media has drained significant amounts of bandwidth people might access and leave on an olympics feed that will churn a ton of bandwidth its not just the productivity drain its the bandwidth drain as well there are a lot more web based apps these days and that reduces the ability and performance of other employees using those applications
2494337 there is a productivity angle to this as well as a bandwidth consumption concern the way weve addressed it is by providing granular policy capabilities that enable people to watch some of it without being draconian and closing it out completely which we can also do
2494338 one is for olympic news but not streaming media and then the other is specific to those sites offering streaming media of the games themselves say the nbc site or any derivative site with media signature patterns
2494339 not just nbcs site but any derivative site with media signature patterns that show it links to the parent site its up to the customer whether or not to block it
2494340 were completely non invasive first off its very common for enterprises to have multiple layers of security at endpoints gateways and internet filtering for monitoring user behavior ours is a complementary security technology with a very high attach rate
2494341 because of our architecture its a pass by appliance device we arent in the direct line of fire trying to access a prohibited site results in a blocked page so we dont slow down network traffic at all or any other network appliances trying to do other security
2494342 enterprises tend to be less draconian they do more monitoring and see through reporting
2494343 enterprises will block adult content and any malware categories phishing botnet sites
2494344 we use a set of automated tools as well as human verifiers to assess and classify malware sites properly
2494345 weve done a lot of research with customers on social networking sites and enterprises tend to block social networking sites outright at least most enterprises do that may change going forward they may block it now but going forward may start to consider it as something they have to provide to employees but ration access typically arent blocked outright so the olympics coverage is a new wrinkle it may result in new policies being created as a result my guess is that they going to block it entirely or limit it and i think theyll opt for the latter one other option is that they may just issue a policy to employees letting them know theyre monitoring it thats very common in enterprises

2494391 the ground at gachibowli was also unplayable and with the kind of rain here it will be worse tomorrow the match then will not be decided by football skills it will be a shame if a final match of such an important tournament is decided by factors not connected to football
2494392 lal bahadur stadium was no better than gachibowli it will be an embarrassment for the afc and aiff if the final is played at lbs which is a cricket ground

2494596 infants need more of an opportunity to learn to like other flavours like fruits and vegetables in nourish well be teaching them about healthy eating habits like they do brushing their teeth or tying their shoelaces
2494597 if youre being exposed to unhealthy food and youre developing preferences for those kinds of food then it can lead to issues such as obesity

2494620 conducted a number of consensual recordings with lawson and others
2494621 lawson told rummage on one tape that they cant trace cash and made overt offers to assist rummage with finding and paying for an attorney
2494622 he also encouraged rummage to take the fifth at an upcoming grand jury session and to get an attorney they could work with
2494623 a collection of innuendo and suspicions and should have never been made public
2494624 at this stage of criminal investigations the law presumes innocence and imposes heavy burdens on prosecutors and fbi agents not to prematurely release information about matters occurring before the grand jury
2494625 todays events destroyed that presumption and breached the grand jurys secrecy
2494626 categorically denies the false and baseless accusations of jim rummage
2494627 there is nothing unusual or improper regarding mr nighberts association with
2494628 two highly respected businessmen whom he has known for some time mr nighbert has not done anything wrong and is guilty of nothing but trying to work and earn a living
2494629 i can confirm that thats the story as i understand it
2494630 jim rummage has recognized he made a mistake he is trying to correct that error at this time through his cooperation
2494631 the conduct in question was not his idea among the things he was concerned about during this period of time was his job security and issues related to that
2494632 nighbert or road contractor leonard lawson directed rummage to obtain the transportation cabinets engineers estimates
2494633 on some occasions rummage delivered the engineers estimates to nighbert but on others he gave them directly to lawson on four of these times lawson gave rummage 5 000 cash for a total of 20 000
2494634 nighbert through his political connections could assist in developing additional business however marr admitted that nighbert had done no work for umg
2494635 investigators believe umg is the conduit for lawson to reward nighbert for his assistance while serving as the ktc secretary
2494636 miss parkinson it is most unusual for former students to come calling like this however under the circumstances but please remember that this is still a school even if not for you appropriate behavior is required at all times

2494640 why are you blaming harry potter for the dark lord killing your parents
2494641 i because theres no one else to blame who else could have caused it
2494642 my own parents suffered at the hands of the dark lord not as severely i agree but can anyone but the dark lord really be held responsible for the dark lords actions
2494643 well professor ive spent the last three hours walking and talking with pansy she made me remember all the fun times i had here
2494644 yes well they may have been fun for you but lets not forget you made a number of people especially those in my house miserable
2494645 i know that professor and if there were some way i could apologize for those days i would but i suppose its all water under the bridge at this point i dont think anyone would listen to me now
2494646 considering what ive been reading in the prophet and heaven knows i should be more selective about giving any credence to what that skeeter woman writes you have made yourself some more enemies in those same classmates that you once tormented
2494647 if thats true i cant imagine that potter or his friends will be all that willing to hear what you have to say
2494648 what has caused this change of heart ive never known you to change your attitude so readily
2494649 i dont know i think that spending this time with pansy well she reminded me of things of people mostly she made me remember her i think i want to try and rebuild that relationship i dont really want potter to take up so much of my life pansy reminded me of how much time and energy i wasted on him when we were in school do i really want to live like that look where its got me look how miserable i am
2494650 we have it all planned out ill go first and then my illustrious twin will go after right george
2494651 he doesnt have quite the attitude of superiority percy has and hes not serious enough
2494652 i am an idiot who is really not very funny or creative at all i should be nicer to my sister the fair ginevra because she is superior to me in every way furthermore i should never be allowed to breed or take any actions which might result in accidental breeding
2494653 that gets you the right to move off the sofa and into the guest bedroom
2494654 oh thank you my wonderful illustrious wife i hope that my sister dear will be as just as you have been
2494655 i too would like to beg your forgiveness oh great and powerful weas erm potters we were unthinking and uncaring and we never intended to ruin your wedding night just to make it a bit more memorable
2494656 oh thank you wise and powerful slayer of dark lords
2494657 yes well unfortunately for you i dont have the final say in this matter youll need to appeal to your sisters good nature
2494658 fair ginevra strongest and most beautiful of all the weasleys forgive us we beseech you
2494659 we are not worthy so much as to lick the dirt from your shoes
2494660 but i have a couple of conditions that must be met
2494661 i thought you said the cannons were playing today harry
2494662 bloody hell arent you ever going to forgive me for that its been three months bad enough that you had to go and tell hermione that i bollixed it up
2494663 youd better be glad that i didnt let ginny do what she wanted to do to you shes evil
2494664 you remember what happened to the twins dont you that was all ginny bill and i just helped with the execution
2494665 all right youve got a point but harry the falcons theyre almost as bad as the tornadoes
2494666 youre at a professional quidditch match with your best mate i wouldnt complain too much if i were you
2494667 still wish it were the cannons playing instead of the falcons
2494668 ask her what her favourite colours are and whether she prefers feathers or lace i know ginny still remembers the spells wed need and im sure weve still got some of the potions left
2494669 no no thats okay youre right i should be grateful that i get to see a professional match at all
2494670 i can be a puddlemere fan for the day wonder if i can spell my shirt blue so i dont stick out
2494671 you know you wouldnt have been able to pull this off if i hadnt been on assignment last month i wouldve known the cannons had been forced to change their schedule i know it like the back of my hand
2494672 you wanker youre the reason i got sent on assignment in the first place arent you tonks didnt need me at all i thought there was something off about that whole situation
2494673 i bet i couldve got mail while i was away too
2494674 im not the one who made his best mate and his wife spend their wedding night on a single bed
2494675 i know i know i said i was sorry i dont know what else to say i just dont know what i was thinking
2494676 youre too easy ron you were forgiven a long time ago
2494677 see that witch down there the one with the paper
2494678 take a good look at the photo on the front page i think its the dursleys
2494679 no really look she just put it down im going to ask her if we can look at it
2494680 she said it was a muggle gossip rag but she was happy to lend it to you i think she fancies you actually
2494681 it was the last bit of payment for that prank they played on our honeymoon they told us they wanted it to be perfect so we let them take all the time they needed im glad we did
2494682 im certain the two gits enjoyed themselves immensely as they fulfilled the end of their punishment so tell me did ginny make them remain in the lingerie until they finished the deed
2494683 nah she broke the spell as soon as they apologised
2494684 hey by the way did you two ever hear back from the hotel about the luggage theft
2494685 didnt hermione tell you im certain ginny said something to her
2494686 we got a letter of apology and an offer for free lodging for a month from the hotel if were ever in the area again they also stated that they caught the culprit it was one of their employees remember romilda vane from hogwarts
2494687 that girl who put the love potion in those chocolate cauldrons i ate in sixth year
2494688 shes the one who took the luggage can you believe it
2494689 that girl was mental at hogwarts nice to see shes hasnt changed
2494690 well you and ginny are so much more well travelled than hermione and me
2494691 para un guardameta mantener la porter a a cero siempre es fant stico
2494692 pero no tuve mucho que ver con eso la verdad porque creo que no hice ninguna parada de m rito en todo el partido
2494693 los cuatro defensas que tengo delante de m tienen tanta confianza con el bal n y una visi n del juego tan buena que facilitan mucho la labor del portero
2494694 marvell hizo todo el trabajo duro en nuestro gol al desgastar a su marcador y centrar el bal n para que alguien lo aprovechara
2494695 vamos a ver el dvd de los holandeses vamos a eliminar los peque os fallos que cometimos contra jap n y estaremos listos para saltar al campo
2494696 we have had some interest in mark from a number of clubs and we received an approach which came from hull city
2494697 we have looked at the offer and we feel that it is a very good deal for the club
2494698 too bad it wasnt like that the first time i apparated
2494699 im just lucky you had such deliberation and determination to make it to our destination
2494700 i didnt pack all of my lingerie for our trip i bet i can find something youll like if you give me a few minutes
2494701 maybe you could have a little chat with dobby about how we dont want to be interrupted
2494702 im so glad you didnt take everything on our trip
2494703 i thought we might write some letters to your i mean our sisters in law and hermione of course to ah advise them of the situation if you know what i mean
2494704 we have to do more than just send an owl to their wives and girlfriend harry
2494705 thats why this is just step one of revenge of the potters
2494706 youre evil i love it what are we going to say
2494707 oh no were very very good hermione trust me on this one
2494708 why dont you tell us why were here you two youre still on your honeymoon so there must be a very good reason
2494709 and id like to know why we had to keep this meeting secret
2494710 i told percy that i was meeting friends for a girls night im not sure if he believed it though
2494711 fred believes everything i tell him he wasnt suspicious at all then again he was in the middle of researching a prank when i left id be surprised if he even knows im gone
2494712 and we think its going to take all of you
2494713 we wanted to warn you three before we did anything
2494714 since you might be affected indirectly and audrey we invited you and fleur because youre both brilliant like the other girls here and we knew youd have some ideas we could use
2494715 oh zis will be so much fun we will of course be onoured to elp non
2494716 but humiliation is well within the realms of possibility dont you think harry
2494717 im happier than ive ever been ginnys fabulous i think ive just been reminded why i shouldnt get on her bad side though
2494718 my william e has told me some stories of your ginny when she was growing up
2494719 you are right to be cautious zere is a reason er bruzzers are afraid of er
2494720 i mean shes older wiser and more powerful than she was before and she knows things that she never knew growing up
2494721 zey forget that she is a woman grown not bill of course e taught er much of what e knew but ze twins and ron and even percy at times i think zey do not know exactly ow dangerous she is do not worry zough arry zey will not forget zat fact for some time after we are zrough with zem
2494722 those boys are just lucky i like their wives and dont want to do anything that might hurt them too much
2494723 you can be downright scary when you have revenge in mind
2494724 thats right youll scar us for life if you keep that up
2494725 i never knew ginny could hold her breath that long
2494726 definitely dont know were here then we need to stop this whatve you got
2494727 find something good george ive got a puking pastille if we could figure out a way to get harry to take it
2494728 whats the mat oh gin gin and ickle harrykins how nice of you to prise your lips apart for the family
2494729 as if you didnt know how many people did mum invite
2494730 remus tonks bill and percy and their wives and charlie and neville and luna
2494731 i thought this was going to be a family thing
2494732 wed better get in there mums starting to go spare
2494733 well except for when our luggage got stolen from our room we couldve done without that happening
2494734 the twins were asking if anything went wrong on our honeymoon
2494735 and then ginny said unless you consider which means something did happen
2494736 honeymoon details harry ginny dont mention those things in the same sentence please ill be scarred for life
2494737 i had no right to barge in on you like that
2494738 and so i let my emotions get in the way of my reason
2494739 harrykins mate we know youre a noble git but this is ridiculous
2494740 i mean your honeymoon what were you thinking inviting mum and dad along need some pointers
2494741 if any one of us could give lessons theyd be the ones to do it
2494742 oh god not mum and dad too bad enough we have to talk about my best mate and little sister having sex but youve brought our parents into it now youve gone too far
2494743 hermione take pity please scourgify my brain i beg you
2494744 and so i barged in on you two on your wedding trip
2494745 not that we wanted you there of course but we did have a fabulous time at home
2494746 its not as if we did anything the two of you have never done
2494747 obviously not maybe youll have to sleep on the sofa until you remember what you did
2494748 were eating outside theres not enough room in here for everyone
2494749 ive got the charms ginnys got the potions theyll never know what hit them
2494750 i didnt know you liked fuchsia its not really the best colour for your complexion though
2494751 a thong fred thats new are you trying to tell me something the lace is lovely though
2494752 what in merlins name are you lot talking about and why do i feel like im in a straightjacket
2494753 im scared and im the one who cast the charm
2494754 we told her we wouldnt do something like this to ron though she knows she doesnt need to worry
2494755 harry were talking about hermione here she worries about everything shes probably making plans right now to help her unborn children revise for their owls
2494756 fred and george weasley what is the meaning of this
2494757 now and dont even think about showing your faces until you have something decent on
2494758 i think that was more of fred and george than ive seen in a long time
2494759 so was sewing all of the openings of our underthings shut and charming them into one long tangled mess
2494760 serves them right i should think dont you agree molly
2494761 is that it for the prank or is there more
2494762 glad i didnt do anything to ruin things for you mate if thats they way you two are going about payback
2494763 blimey mate youve only been married for three weeks and youve already forgotten your anniversary dont let ginny know or youll be in for it for sure
2494764 wait dont answer that let me assure you that im not that stupid im perfectly aware that we were married on the thirteenth i was just wondering if you were
2494765 harry and i wanted to thank you for arranging the hotel for us on our wedding night it was something special wasnt it harry
2494766 it was special all right especially since our room only had two single beds
2494767 well thats not so wait a minute i know i booked the honeymoon suite for saturday the twentieth
2494768 what in the name of merlins baggy y fronts are you on about harry
2494769 here neville swap with me and let me use your chair
2494770 are you mad im not going to sit in the chair that keeps dumping you to the ground find another seat
2494771 but we didnt have anything to do with the incredible shrinking chair
2494772 we could make some galleons with that if we knew how it was done
2494773 all right harry very funny ha ha now can i please sit
2494774 but you might as well just go straight to the ground it wont matter what you sit on youre still going to end up down there anyway
2494775 so whatever it is its not on the chair its on ron
2494776 but why me i didnt do anything to ruin your honeymoon
2494777 other than booking the honeymoon suite for the wrong weekend youre right you didnt do anything wrong
2494778 have you been confunded lately you prat when did we get married
2494779 because if you arent youve got to be the thickest person to walk the earth of course i remember
2494780 got married on the thirteenth of march it was a lovely ceremony and you stood up for harry remember that
2494781 you had one job to reserve the hotel for our wedding night you remember that too i assume
2494782 when you booked the honeymoon suite you did it for the twentieth not the thirteenth
2494783 when harry went to check us into the hotel the honeymoon suite wasnt available in fact there was only one room available it was lovely
2494784 except for the fact that there were only two small beds beds big enough for only one person each
2494785 that we really didnt need the extra space that a larger bed wouldve given us
2494786 but we couldve done so much more if you catch my meaning
2494787 im sorry i made a mistake it wont happen again
2494788 you might know that if you ever came to your senses and asked hermione to marry you
2494789 shes acting like he hasnt got a clue what sex is
2494790 obviously mums never gone over to their flat and seen that they share a bedroom
2494791 i just dont need to hear that harry and ginny know what it is or what theyre doing
2494792 its more than enough for me to think of the possibility of ginny having you know with harry i dont need all the gory details
2494793 gory details oh we didnt even come close to the gory details did we harry
2494794 is every chair i sit in going to dump me on my arse
2494795 you need to work out how to counter this you dont think were im going to let you off that easily do you
2494796 oh come on gin its me your brother cant you help a bloke out
2494797 you got yourself into this mess you need to work out how to get yourself out
2494798 you know how ron is im sure he didnt mean to do anything wrong hes just a prat and a thick one at that
2494799 you probably ought to give him a hint to how to break the spell hell never work it out on his own im certain
2494800 i dont know what i was thinking when i made the reservation it was an honest mistake i promise and itll never happen again
2494801 i know you didnt mean to ruin our wedding night
2494802 ive learnt entirely too much about my familys sex lives tonight what i really want to know is how you vanished half of my chair out from under me could come in handy sometime
2494803 no i dont think i can i do believe youre getting everything you deserve
2494804 unlike you ron didnt purposely do anything to ruin our honeymoon hes just an idiot and didnt make the proper reservation you two on the other hand
2494805 jinxed us maliciously and as such you need to suffer

2494813 de qu iba la celebraci n que hizo de aquel gol
2494814 tiene que ver con el hecho de que yo no tengo mucha estatura todo el mundo me dec a que nunca llegar a a triunfar como futbolista porque era demasiado bajito
2494815 por eso hago ese gesto cada vez que marco un buen gol porque me aumenta la talla
2494816 bastante gente aseguraba que nunca ser a futbolista profesional por culpa de mi altura se public en los peri dicos aunque algunos entrenadores nunca se atrevieron a dec rmelo a la cara creo que tambi n ellos lo pensaban
2494817 siempre he confiado plenamente en mis propias facultades y ahora estoy deseando sacar a todo el mundo de su error quiero que los que no creyeron en m se enteren bien de que se equivocaban eso me motiva enormemente
2494818 no me esperaba eso la ovaci n del p blico me sorprendi mucho y me hizo muy muy feliz y muy muy orgulloso
2494819 fue un d a cargado de emociones el gol mi actuaci n y aquella ovaci n del p blico puesto en pie
2494820 tambi n me dej estupefacto lo que el seleccionador de honduras dijo de m aunque le estoy muy agradecido
2494821 son profesionales que jugaron en las m ximas competiciones y saben bien por lo que tenemos que pasar los j venes futbolistas como yo su influencia es important sima para mi carrera adem s me han ofrecido esta oportunidad maravillosa de jugar con la selecci n nacional y exhibir mis facultades en estos juegos ol mpicos

2494831 we are at the top of the pit lane so there were a lot of cars in front of me after the red flag i knew that last lap would have to be perfect but i thought there would be too much traffic there was a little but i also got a tow which helped a bit
2494832 of course i want to win every race but because this isnt part of a championship i am quite relaxed about it we will either win or we wont lets just see what happens tomorrow

2494840 they came to me with a plan for us to switch inventory accounting methods which some of their other clients had done and said it would save taxes therefore generating more cash
2494841 frankly i was worried that it would turn out to be a gimmick
2494842 that would bring their write offs in line with current expenses
2494843 best of all it would accomplish the goal of increasing their write offs always desirable since this would cut their tax bill
2494844 there were all these accounting decisions we would have to make and it all sounded very very complex
2494845 but said he didnt need to understand all those obscure accounting details all he wanted to know was whether it made financial sense for us if i was convinced that it did he would do it
2494846 we took another look at the projections for the acquired business and they are not as good as we thought last year
2494847 what earnings number should be used to evaluate company performance
2494848 were going to snape tonight shall we have supper there
2494849 time is of the essence but were on the ice and in the game
2494850 there are still many details to be ironed out in terms of the fiscal commitments that the province and the federal and municipal governments will be making
2494851 there are a lot of social activists in toronto who have very appropriate concerns about the economy in toronto and social issues in toronto and i think those people need to be embraced early and need to understand the benefit that will ultimately accrue to them by having a healthier more vibrant economy in the city
2494852 i think theyre starting to see merit in supporting sport that theres a return on investment for high performance sport notwithstanding that were starting to recognize that projects like this done well that can stay on budget that are marketed well have a net economic benefit to the region and id be surprised if they didnt look at whats going on in british columbia and recognize that the economy there has become much healthier since the olympic games were awarded

2494868 president bush spoke to russian president dmitry medvedev and georgian president mikhail saakashvili this evening
2494869 president bush spoke to secretary of state condoleezza rice and national security adviser stephen hadley for about an hour and gave them instructions on what should be communicated to the parties
2494870 we support georgias territorial integrity and call for an immediate cease fire
2494871 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire
2494872 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2494873 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2494874 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2494875 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2494876 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2494887 kalau nabi muhammad tidak menyatakan tentang pahala yang berlimpah jika kita melaksanakan sesuatu ibadah atau perintah allah adakah manusia akan menyembah allah
2494888 kalau allah tidak menciptakan syurga dan neraka adakah manusia akan menyembah allah
2494889 kau fikir balik kalau nabi muhammad sendiri yang maksum bererti tidak melakukan dosa atau dosanya akan diampunkan allah tetap mendirikan solat kenapa kau pulak tak nak solat sedangkan kau manusia biasa yang banyak buat dosa

2494893 that is just god and country day and promoting that event
2494894 thats one of the discounts for that sunday for people that do attend church
2494895 it is unfortunate that wilson county has decided to specifically endorse and promote christianity through this program and discriminate against its non christian citizens i was disappointed when the fair office stated they did not see this as discrimination
2494896 this was probably the hardest bout i fenced in my career but you know i did what i had to do
2494897 its important for us to get a championship at mis
2494898 its been one of our goals since the beginning of the year especially for my sponsor the swiss colony with the home office out of monroe wi mis is basically their home track as well
2494899 i think its a great thing especially for some of the younger competitors to have an opportunity to try out with joe gibbs racing its a great way to see how you stack up against the other drivers around the country
2494900 it would be fun to go and drive their cars and see how they do things

2494918 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2494919 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2494920 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2494921 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

2494923 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2494924 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2494925 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2494926 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2494997 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2494998 now we get to the most relevant question if john edwards political career is done why isnt john mccains john mccain had a well documented affair on his first wife with his current wife he has admitted in the books he has written about his life that he ran around with several different women while still married to his first wife and dont forget that he left her for a younger richer woman multi millionaire cindy hensley who is now cindy mccain after she had been severely hurt in a car accident
2494999 so why are mccains actions any more excusable than edwards because it was thirty years ago does that wash it away will we be fine with edwards running for office again in a couple of years because then it will all be in the past what is the statute of limitations on an affair
2495000 so why are mccains actions any more excusable than edwards
2495001 will we be fine with edwards running for office again in a couple of years because then it will all be in the past
2495002 because it was thirty years ago does that wash it away
2495003 edwards lied mccain was up front with his wife and got a divorce
2495004 you see the pictures in the paper today of john kerry windsurfing hes at his home in nantucket this week doing his favorite thing windsurfing even his hobby depends on which way the wind blows
2495005 nd they have gotten away with it for so long they figure no one is watching caring
2495006 did edwards throw his crippled wife under the bus to marry a rich
2495007 mccain dumped his wife who waited patiently all those years while he was a pow because she was no longer the former beauty queen but a cripple he dumped her for a rich heiress 20 years his senior
2495008 mccain needed a divorce from carol his wife of 14 years from whom he was separated after mccains dramatic homecoming from vietnam the couple grew apart their marriage began disintegrating while mccain was stationed in jacksonville mccain has admitted to having extramarital affairs
2495009 i attribute it more to john turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than i do to anything else
2495010 you mean except his wife or did he tell carol he had a date with cindy
2495011 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2495012 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2495013 no they were separated why did he have to tell her funny how you missed that
2495014 dont blame andrea for trying to put lipstick on a pig i would do the same
2495015 to claim that edwards behavior is more reprehensible than mccains is just delusional or hypocritical or both

2495028 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2495029 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2495030 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2495031 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2495032 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2495033 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2495034 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas
2495035 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2495036 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2495037 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2495038 time is of the essence but were on the ice and in the game
2495039 there are still many details to be ironed out in terms of the fiscal commitments that the province and the federal and municipal governments will be making
2495040 there are a lot of social activists in toronto who have very appropriate concerns about the economy in toronto and social issues in toronto and i think those people need to be embraced early and need to understand the benefit that will ultimately accrue to them by having a healthier more vibrant economy in the city
2495041 i think theyre starting to see merit in supporting sport that theres a return on investment for high performance sport notwithstanding that were starting to recognize that projects like this done well that can stay on budget that are marketed well have a net economic benefit to the region and id be surprised if they didnt look at whats going on in british columbia and recognize that the economy there has become much healthier since the olympic games were awarded

2495265 weve gotten a few reports that some ceos have received what purports to be a federal subpoena via e mail ordering their testimony in a case
2495266 it then asks them to click a link and download the case history and associated information one problem its totally bogus
2495267 an interesting component of this scam was that it did properly identify the ceo and send it to his e mail directly its very highly targeted that way
2495268 like many other spear phishing attacks the phisher performed research before launching his or her attack
2495269 specifically the individual was able to locate and use our ceos e mail address and the cyveillance phone number in the e mail this information was used to enable and build additional credibility for the attack
2495270 the first step is to eliminate the vulnerabilities by staying patched there is the challenge of the zero day threat but from what weve seen the majority of these trojans are spreading through vulnerabilities that can be closed

2495282 in the past few months more than 1 of all search results contained at least one result that we believe to point to malicious content and the trend seems to be increasing
2495283 today the majority of web advertisements are distributed in the form of third party content to the advertising web site
2495284 this practice is somewhat worrisome as a web page is only as secure as its weakest component in particular even if the web page itself does not contain any exploits insecure ad content poses a risk to advertising web sites with the increasing use of ad syndication which allows an advertiser to sell advertising space to other advertising companies that in turn can yet again syndicate their content to other parties the chances that insecure content gets inserted somewhere along the chain quickly escalates far too often this can lead to web pages running advertisements to untrusted content
2495285 o n average 12 of the overall search results that returned landing pages were associated with malicious content due to unsafe ads
2495286 clearly it is increasingly difficult to maintain trust along such long delivery chains
2495287 it was a software problem and it took a software fix
2495288 in this case it looks like the hackers exploited the weakest link
2495289 retail is a sector which is not known for high security in particular
2495290 the security landscape has shifted from people trying to make a name for themselves to people trying to keep hidden you definitely will see more attacks
2495291 we would suggest that companies have a good penetration regime in place so they can find the vulnerabilities in their systems before the hackers do

2495308 por isso que a r ssia tem interesse em impedir a resolu o dos conflitos separatistas
2495309 isso pode fazer parte da rea o russa natural mas creio que o fator principal que os russos n o esperavam que os georgianos enfrentassem este assunto com meios militares
2495310 mas a envergadura da opera o militar georgiana foi tamanha que provocou uma rea o russa

2495357 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
2495358 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2495359 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2495360 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2495361 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2495362 if the election is close it could come down to small demographic changes in some areas
2495363 i played the front side and i shot one under had 19 putts so it was really frustrating to do that but i hit the ball real well today

2495383 the decision was approved today in the board meeting of our association to reduce the sufferings of the workers and also to raise the productivity of them
2495384 the enhancement will have a new pressure for us but we want a peaceful atmosphere in factories so that our production is not hampered and can sustain growth
2495385 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2495386 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2495387 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2495388 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2495389 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2495390 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2495391 all attempts to contact her have failed it is feared that zeng has been taken into police custody and might be mistreated
2495392 local residents have suffered damage petty theft graffiti fighting noise and the general anti social behaviour associated with perceived drug dealing
2495393 there has been a large impact on the whole community as a consequence of the goings on at this property
2495394 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2495395 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2495396 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2495397 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2495398 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2495399 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2495400 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2495401 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2495402 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2495403 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2495404 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2495405 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2495406 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2495407 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2495408 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2495409 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2495410 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2495411 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2495412 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2495413 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2495414 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2495415 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2495416 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2495417 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2495418 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2495419 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2495420 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2495421 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2495422 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2495423 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2495424 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2495425 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2495426 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2495427 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2495428 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2495429 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2495430 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2495431 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2495432 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2495433 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2495434 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2495435 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2495436 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2495437 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2495438 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2495439 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2495440 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2495441 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2495442 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2495443 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2495444 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2495445 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2495446 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2495447 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2495448 who are open to doing something on the production side
2495449 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2495450 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2495451 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2495452 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2495453 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2495454 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2495455 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2495456 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2495457 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2495458 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2495459 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2495460 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2495461 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2495462 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2495463 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2495464 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2495465 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2495466 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2495467 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2495468 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2495469 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2495470 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2495471 we still have to return to put the marker beacons at the end of each fishtail but that wont take too long
2495472 in the meantime the new beach is open and we will open other areas as we are able and they are completed it will be a sort of staggered opening along the beach south

2495481 i will have to go back and talk to my coach and go back to the drawing board
2495482 i think it was just one of those days everything was going great up until i got in i got in the water and nothing happened i did the first two strokes and it didnt feel right
2495483 it was the hardest race i have ever done everyone was so close
2495484 i was trying to focus on myself and make it to the semis and i did it i hope i can go quicker tomorrow

2495502 we get lots of people from kilkenny who want to see the south of their county taking this train ride
2495503 the only way you can see that part of the county is from this railway or from a boat on the river because there is no access by road on our first journey we had passengers who ranged in age from 6 weeks old to 106 the 106 year old was a nun who used to travel on this rail when she made her way from waterford to the convent in cork she was absolutely thrilled to be back on it again
2495504 the castle which dates from 1640 was destroyed by cromwells troops
2495505 the comorants come to rest on its remains after theyve been fishing and they dry themselves off up there travellers on the train can usually be guaranteed a few comorant sightings as they pass by
2495506 it definitely has the biggest collection of rhododendrons in europe
2495507 within the 110 acres of garden there are over 3 500 varieties of rhododendron 650 camellias 300 magnolias and 250 types of japanese maple
2495508 people used to come and take the moss to line flower baskets
2495509 but thankfully they dont do that anymore you can also see a lime kiln over on the right the practice of burning lime was common in the last century the wood for fuel for the kiln was brought across from co kilkenny by boat and the lime produced was used by farmers as a fertiliser and also as a whitewash for thatched cottages
2495510 we also pass woodstown viking village which was discovered in 2003 when they were doing an archaeological dig before starting the waterford by pass
2495511 its a big viking village which pre dated waterford city and it is so significant that they had to leave it undisturbed and change the route of the by pass they recovered thousands of objects on the dig but for now it is being left alone until a decision is made about its future
2495512 we have to stop here now because of the waterford by pass
2495513 we have an agreement with the national roads authority to stop here until their work is finished and then they will return the land to us and the train will be able to continue to bilberry station in waterford the station is there ready and waiting for our arrival
2495514 and the track which has been taken up will be returned to us
2495515 in transition year in the cbs in jamess street i got to try out lots of different things
2495516 we got to do drama and music as well as our usual subjects and in fact we were the first year to take music for the leaving cert before that you werent allowed to take music for the leaving because of the way the subject choices were organised but about eight of us decided we really wanted to do it so we pushed for it and we got it
2495517 i have loads of time for waterford i moved down there while i was at college and i worked at the talbot hotel and at aol i learned a lot while working at america online and not just about technical support i learned patience and tolerance too i often had to calm the person on the other end of the phone so now i am patient if i have to phone for technical support i know the person in the call centre is trying to help and it just might take them a while to get me the help im looking for
2495518 yeah im the one they call on when theres software to be installed

2495520 we offer advice recording photography online advertising and gigs and we host the one take sessions every third thursday of the month in cleeres pub where local bands play and then we offer a selection of their gig on podcast on the website
2495521 instead of people coming to hear appointed people speak it is based on the people attending being allowed the freedom to participate and move around from lecture to lecture if someone feels they want to give a talk on something they can put their name down and go for it all ages of people turned up for the podcast camp from teens to people in their seventies my granddad was there were holding another one in march in the parade tower and that will be a creative camp which will fuse the best of business technology with the creative
2495522 we put it on again because so many people wanted to see it
2495523 and since then the rights have been bought twice by other theatre companies we also brought cannibal the musical to the watergate and i directed it
2495524 we wanted to do theatre which was relevant to people our age
2495525 and provide an alternative to going to the pub on a saturday night we had been in dreamstuff the theatre wing of young irish filmmakers where i had played brian in the life of brian i had played the lead in the musical half a sixpence when i was at school and making the transition from playing in a band to appearing on stage was grand because there was music involved there are some differences between playing music on stage and acting though with the music you get to be yourself and you get lost in your music and delivering it the way it was intended to be delivered with theatre so much has to go right so it has an extra edge but i am comfortable on stage with devious i am also involved in production advertising and working backstage no im not a control freak
2495526 i was there years ago and i want to go back again i was supposed to be in canada last week but i went up to my parents house in sligo and took the kayak out onto loch talt i bought a kayak at christmas and spent every day out in it over the holidays kayaking is pure escapism you switch off the mobile switch off your head and just float around on the lake
2495527 my brother gary took to it before i did and it sounded like great fun myself and gary are in a funky trad band in sligo now called the boxty band and we played over new years im in a trad band here too called the cracked bucket band and we have played in paris texas pub
2495528 the new curriculum promotes the integration of all the subjects learned in primary school
2495529 the emphasis is on combining science and mathematics with language literacy and the visual arts we have been working with robotics in the school since 1999 so we asked the question can we use robotics in language
2495530 louise allen the education officer with the butler gallery organised freeform which took some of the works in the gallery and allowed the children to work on the images using animation software
2495531 there was an etching of don quixote on the wall of the butler gallery depicting the scene where don quixote and sancho panza tickle the feet in the forest
2495532 later in the year we were trying to come up with an idea for a project to enter for the rolls royce science prize and one of the children remembered the don quixote sketch so we read a few chapters of the book watched a few film and musical versions of it and chose the episode where don quixote and sancho panza attack the windmills
2495533 the children had to work out how much strength the gears would need to lift don quixote off his horse
2495534 they learned all about different types of gearing and how to co ordinate his approach on the horse with the turning of the sails
2495535 we knew they would pick the top 30 and award each of those 1 000
2495536 we made it into the top 30 and we were delighted but then we heard we had been chosen as one of the 9 finalists we couldnt believe it we came third overall and received 5 000 which all went on buying more equipment
2495537 we had travelled to skerries in co dublin to see the windmill on the coast there
2495538 the trip to the skerries windmill and our involvement in the green schools project sparked a great interest in how mills work and the children decided they wanted to construct a mill
2495539 we entered films of the children making the mill and the wind turbine as well as the don quixote impossible dreamers film
2495540 we also had to include a virtual classroom tour out of the 82 projects which were entered by schools from all over the world 24 semi finalists were chosen there were three categories community collaboration and content we came first in the content category
2495541 i was reading old newspapers in rothe house library and i was amazed when i read these accounts of so many cricket matches
2495542 the first one i came across was a half page report on a match played in the 1930s but the first cricket matches in kilkenny were played in the early 1800s in 1869 there was a marvellous description in the kilkenny moderator of a cricket match between johnstown and urlingford cricket hit its peak in 1896 when there were over 50 teams of eleven in the county and the thing that amazed me was that it was played in rural areas and by ordinary people in england cricket was played in the towns and villages but in kilkenny farmers built pavilions on their land and held cricket matches on sundays usually in ireland cricket was introduced to a town through the barracks and then left with the soldiers but i think in kilkenny it started with the houses of the landed gentry such as those at norelands gowran bessborough and desart court sons of the gentry who attended public school in england would want to play cricket when they came home for the summer holidays so pitches equipment and teams were organised
2495543 in 1905 the gaa introduced a ban on playing foreign games
2495544 but if you said to people from kilkenny that cricket was a foreign game they wouldnt know what you were talking about
2495545 john and jimmy fennelly from stoneyford played cricket and hurling
2495546 and when i spoke to jimmy who is now 87 he recalled that john had been suspended from hurling for having a cricket bat on his bicycle
2495547 gilbert butler in maidenhall started a cricket team in 1929
2495548 its amazing that he found young men wanting to take up cricket when hurling was so strong it was difficult for cricket to continue then again during the second world war because of lack of transport and equipment but it got going again in 1947 and there were a few teams including kilkenny city dunbell graignamanagh upper grange lower grange and gowran gowran was very important in the history of cricket it started there in 1842 and finished in 1958 and at one stage they had three teams the horse and mower from gowran castle would come out every saturday and mow the cricket pitch and the horse wore special soft shoes to make sure there was no damage done to the pitch
2495549 eddie mcdermott told me all about his father jimmy mcdermott who was a great player and the minute books from gowran castle cricket team were kept and they were a great help in my research i also talked to tim comerford father of martin and andy from the kilkenny hurling team in gowran and he remembers a group of 16 year olds forming a hurling team in 1953 and they went on to win the county final and that was the end of cricket
2495550 hurling was exciting and very appealing to both players and spectators and it is a bat and ball game also some of the skills of both games are similar so it was easy for players to make the transition from cricket to hurling
2495551 the wives and mothers and children would gather to watch the cricket on summer evenings and there would be tea and cakes in the pavilions or under a tree and people would meet up they really missed it when it was gone
2495552 i used to get the adventure wizard and hotspur comics when i was young and there would usually be a cricket game in them and then later when i was studying science at university college dublin and living in rathmines i would watch them play cricket in st marys college
2495553 so i got to know the game and i learned the rules but you dont need to know about cricket to read the book
2495554 but every time i spoke to someone who remembered the cricket matches or i read some amazing fact in one of the old newspapers it fired me up to keep going and im really glad i did it
2495555 the roadies hated the load in because it was down a narrow alleyway but it was fairly funky when everyone was packed in and the sweat was pouring down the walls
2495556 on sunday nights we would have had twelve or thirteen hundred people in the mayfair
2495557 the pubs used to close at 10 oclock on a sunday night and then everybody would make their way to the mayfair we would have about 200 women in early but when the women started going to pubs too there would be no one in until about 10 30 it was six shillings to get in and for that you got a nights dancing to a live band until 2 oclock in the morning
2495558 i met my wife anne in the mayfair when i was manager
2495559 she was anne dunphy from castlecomer then and we were married in 1963
2495560 desart hall was a great place on a friday night
2495561 i worked in the woollen mills in greenvale all week and then on friday night i went dancing it was all waltzes then and the ormonde follies were the band
2495562 because saturday was the eve of a holy day some of the hotels like the rose hill now hotel kilkenny the club house the globe and the railway hotel on john st had small ballrooms but the mayfair was the big one and people came from all over the county it was also the place where club dinner dances were held usually on a wednesday night and they went on until 4 oclock in the morning they would be the nurses or macra na feirme or other organisations every year the county dance on the night of the kilkenny county show was held and i remember at the bottom of the poster for the county dance it said free bicycle park
2495563 people would cycle miles to dance at the mayfair then cycle all the way back home again and then get up for work the next morning
2495564 but if a club wanted a bar for their dress dance an outside publican would come in and set up a bar for the night he brought his own bottles no draught
2495565 a few of us from st fiacres place got together and practised the tunes of lonie donergan i was the only one with a proper instrument at the time because i had been playing in orchestras and i had my saxophone we used a washboard and thimbles for rhythm and for a bass we took a tea chest cut a hole in the centre of it put a pole up the back of it and tied a string to it and played that the strings tautness could be adjusted to vary the sound for drums we had a biscuit tin and drumsticks the drumsticks were real drumsticks
2495566 one day a priest named fr walsh heard us rehearsing in the old schoolhouse on patrick st and asked us to play in a charity concert we said yes and then he asked the lads who were there to come up with a name for us some of the lads were playing cards and this guy pj oneill came up with the black aces and thats how we got our name
2495567 we played in boston chicago philadelphia and the city centre ballroom on broadway in new york
2495568 and it was great we did it again in 1966 and each tour lasted a month
2495569 he had four black guys with him and they were down the front holding the crowd back using the handles of brushes
2495570 he had played at tullamore earlier the same day to make it worth his while financially
2495571 we got the body of a lorry and had it custom built with aeroplane seats inside and the black aces written on the side and top we were travelling all over the country and doing a lot of work up north aswell it meant we only got to play in kilkenny about once very six months but the crowd were always brilliant and they thronged to see us we were so young when we started most of us werent even 20 years old of course it came to an end and i got a job in the esb but im still playing im with the marble city sounds now and were mostly a wedding band
2495572 my eleven year old and my eight year old and my husband are also members
2495573 every second week there is a shoot somewhere in the country and if its near enough the whole family goes
2495574 and this is my second trip to the woods you start in the youth centre in new ross where we train every tuesday night and when you are ready you come out to the woods
2495575 anyone can come along to the youth centre on a tuesday night and we would always encourage new members
2495576 safety is paramount we all follow a strict code of practice to make sure that no one is injured and no one comes out to the woods until theyre ready
2495577 they are measured in pounds and the womens bows are lighter than the mens
2495578 the poundage refers to the amount of pressure it takes to draw the bow back womens would usually be up to 30lbs and the mens go up to about 46lbs
2495579 this is field archery which is very different from the archery you see in the olympics
2495580 we shoot without sights its more instinctive we dont aim specifically its based on american archery which comes from a hunting tradition
2495581 and now i move down to the second marker and fire my second arrow
2495582 so the points for each arrow go down it sounds complex but its easy when you get the hang of it the best score you can get is twenty points for a kill with your first arrow
2495583 its a flat bow influenced by the north american plains indians i did a course in bow making while i was visiting british columbia a few years ago and i made a bow from the wood of a ewe tree
2495584 you can never trust what you see from back here
2495585 people say things like that was a bit low you need to go higher and then when you get down to the boss you discover that you werent low at all and your last two arrows are lost in the trees behind we lose arrows all the time but someone on a subsequent shoot will find them and keep them for you thats why we put our initials on them we also carry knives for when arrows get stuck in the boss or in a tree
2495586 yes i was hoping i would get to demonstrate that
2495587 but no one has lost an arrow in the undergrowth today
2495588 i was here for months before anyone asked me what i did for a living
2495589 theres no better way to spend a sunday morning youre out in the woods youre getting a bit of exercise doing something you enjoy what could be better
2495590 i suppose it all started when i was at school in the vec in kilkenny
2495591 i had an art teacher called geraldine maher who advised me to take my portfolio and apply for a course being given by cliodhna cussen the sculptor
2495592 cliodhna offered us the choice of working in either stone or wood and because my brother was a carpenter i thought sure he can teach me about wood so i chose stone and that was it i took to it straight away after that my mother suggested that i do an anco course the equivalent of a f s course today in stone carving and i did
2495593 i love working with kilkenny limestone its one of my favourites along with slate from valentia island in co kerry
2495594 all the letters were pre cut and sandblasted onto the stone which at the time i thought was great then my father died in 1997 and i did his headstone when it was finished i stood back and looked at it and thought no thats not good work my father had been a painter and decorator and signwriter and was an influence on me i wanted his headstone to be better i started working with david lambert here in kilkenny and through him i met pip hall an artist and letter carver from the uk her lessons were inspiring and she gave me great advice from there i went to wales for formal training with ieuan rees
2495595 once you have an understanding of roman lettering then you can play around with lettering and bring your own style to it
2495596 the kilkenny county enterprise board were a great help to me when i was setting up
2495597 sculptors from all over the world were invited and each person left a piece behind
2495598 we worked on letter carving for the commemoration of the 1798 rebellion in collins barracks
2495599 there were five letter carvers altogether including david lambert it was great to get a chance to do good quality lettering on a job in ireland jobs in ireland dont come up very often
2495600 the lettering from a computer just doesnt have the same soul hand drawn letters have movement and they work with the piece
2495601 you see the way each letter has movement of its own
2495602 once you start working with lettering you see it everywhere
2495603 when i started learning to draw letters i used to take notice of lettering everywhere on television on posters on the credits after films everywhere
2495604 its a geometric form of the holy family and it stands in the turin cemetery in mullingar its difficult to carve a headstone for a loved one but its a lovely achievement when you finish it i carved my fathers and then i carved my mothers in 2004 my mum was a keen gardener and she was born and died in april she loved daffodils
2495605 there was a robin who used to follow mum around the garden as she worked
2495606 i have carved a spiral pattern into one third of the bowl and the rest i have polished
2495607 when this piece is finished it too will be going to kildare where i hope children will play on it over the years and shine it up
2495608 note how the artist has created an otherworldliness by placing the subject in a setting that transcends time and space
2495609 note how the architects have created a sense of relief with the placement of the 20th century benches

2495613 we had a revolution in france to win equality we had a sexual revolution in 1968 when women fought for contraception and abortion

2495621 because in the matters of national security policy making its a matter of understanding risk its a matter of gauging your opponents and its a matter of being held accountable john mccains never done any of that in his official positions i certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war he was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in armed forces as a prisoner of war he has been a voice on the senate armed services committee and he has traveled all over the world but he hasnt held executive responsibility

2495630 the challenge for many networked embedded systems is there is no way to distinguish critical packets from the large volume of non essential ethernet traffic
2495631 ethernet packets are processed on a first come first served basis important packets are left to wait while the packets that arrived ahead of them are processed for embedded systems this leads to systems that are not responsive or worse fail to meet essential deadlines
2495632 previously such sophisticated packet processing was only available in much larger and costlier systems
2495633 quality of service qos standards have been driven by the it industry but have not been broadly adopted in the embedded market due to its complexity and cost the prioritized ethernet framework for the rtxc quadnet tcp ip suite now offers an affordable solution for delivering this capability to embedded systems

2495749 for about the last 20 years the conventional view for policy makers in washington is that any activity in the arctic and antarctic is basically related to science
2495750 i expect that sometime in the near future there will be an issuance of what they call a national security presidential directive to lay out new policy in the arctic
2495751 this will deal with more issues of sovereignty security presence and things like that
2495752 the question is what do we want to project up here
2495753 the primary mission right now is the maritime boundary line with russia keeping foreigners from stealing alaskan fish
2495754 the way we do that is either put ships or airplanes or both on the boundary line and we do a barking dog routine
2495755 the fleets are further north than ever because the species are moving north

2495787 in the short and medium term the internet has had an underwhelming effect on the real estate and home services industry
2495788 to clarify there are a lot of agents brokers contractors developers you name it that have done just fine with traditional marketing and referrals
2495789 however in the long term the internet will have an overwhelming impact on this very same industry these same players will not continue to be able to effectively function going forward in the next few years without embracing web 2 0 techniques

2495796 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

2495798 is likely to outspend mccain and the republican national committee combined by perhaps two to one between now and election day we very well may see senator obama spend 400m or more
2495799 when obama takes these mushy positions it could speak to a character issue voters that dont pay a lot of attention look at one thing does the guy believe in something they may be saying the guy is afraid of his own shadow
2495800 a lot of people tried to convince themselves that he was a progressive hero and i think they were disappointed

2495821 there is no contradiction between true religion and science when a religion is opposed to science it becomes mere superstition that which is contrary to knowledge is ignorance

2495824 the son of god became man that we might become god
2495825 of pertaining to believing in or belonging to a religion based on the teachings of jesus christ
2495826 there is no regularly constituted church of christ on earth nor any person qualified to administer any church ordinances nor can there be until new apostles are sent by the great head of the church for whose coming i am seeking
2495827 nor can a christian believer be forced beyond sacred scriptures unless some new and proved revelation should be added for we are forbidden by divine law to believe except what is proved either through the divine scriptures or through manifest revelation
2495828 i have sought nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the holy scriptures the spiritual powers have been not only corrupted by sin but absolutely destroyed so that there is now nothing in them but a depraved reason and a will that is the enemy and opponent of god i simply say that christianity has ceased to exist among those who should have preserved it
2495829 if we lose california if they defeat the marriage amendment im afraid that the culture war is over and christians have lost
2495830 ive never said that publicly until now but thats just the reality of the fact
2495831 if the homosexuals are able to defeat the marriage amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman then the culture war is over and weve lost and gradually secularism will replace christianity as the foundation of our society
2495832 california is a big dam holding back the flood and if you take down the dam in california its going to flood 49 other states
2495833 it will destroy marriage as it has been known for thousands of years and with that the cultural decline that normally would follow

2495850 its the first linux based distribution that provides ease of use out of the box
2495851 straight forward xubuntu with a beos like slapped on it
2495852 you dont agree with me criticize me so you dont understand it
2495853 like in your response you like to use beos references again and again to indicate that although pc os isnt a rebuild of beos it will be providing what beos provided
2495854 well it doesnt and i know beos too well to say that in a heartbeat heck you couldnt even change the remastersys generated grub to provide something with its own look and feel
2495855 to be honest i didnt know you were scorched by the osnews crowd but i can image some werent too keen on the beos reference they can be tough to deal with but they are also brutally honest again part of open source but that you know already
2495856 i came looking for pc os since desktoplinux wrote about it used the beos references extensively and quoting you on it as part of my writing i test out linux distributions constantly and the beos heritage is dear to me so if i was led astray i dont think the blame is on me
2495857 i dont blame you for making your own little custom version of ubuntu and sharing it why should i you are entitled to do that i dont agree with the claims on your own website the claims in your blog and i blame desktoplinux for writing the article the way they did since it seems to be based on hearsay instead of actually popping the disk in the drive

2495864 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2495865 we have security from 6pm and we refuse service to anyone who is highly intoxicated the security guards also do walk throughs to make sure everything is going smoothly and will remove anyone from the pub if theyre too drunk there is also the responsible service of alcohol rsa signage displayed which is a legal requirement
2495866 violence will not be tolerated and anyone who is seen to be involved in anti social behaviour will be asked to leave and depending on what has occurred the police may be called
2495867 id say by midnight almost 90 per cent of the patrons would be considered intoxicated if i refused all those people service wed make absolutely no money and i dont think my boss would be too pleased im not really sure what the exact definition of intoxicated is i stop serving someone if theyre at the slurring and stumbling stage but before that id definitely still serve them how do you know when someones drunk too much each person is different
2495868 people think were just big blokes which is true a lot of us are but were also trained in protection were taught how to diffuse certain situations how to react and weve got to do it properly or there can be huge problems we can risk losing our jobs
2495869 i have mates that work at nightclubs and they have a few problems but nothing compared to what ive seen in pubs the nightclub owners think that its great because their venues are safer but honestly theyre only really safer in the violence sense but there are other risks at clubs i think the real reason theres less violence in clubs is because alcohol consumption is less but drug use is high so thats not really a good solution or alternative
2495870 even the most passive people can get into fights when they are drinking you never know how people are going to react ive seen people get into fights about the stupidest things or worse for reasons they dont even remember the next morning
2495871 there are lots of factors involved in alcohol fuelled violence but i think the main one is the loss of inhibitions affects different receptors of the brain where a person might find themselves engaging in all types of anti social behaviours
2495872 being intoxicated brings men to their primal instincts and violence being one of them is sort of brought out when they are under the influence and then combined with the whole alpha male pride means fights will definitely occur on a night out
2495873 its pretty common for guys my age to intentionally go out of their way to look for fights in small groups it can be very satisfying to become aggressive when you are under the influence the adrenaline seems to be exaggerated in a way you feel more confident in your physical presence
2495874 theres no such thing as a clean fight anymore your mates will always jump in because youll never know if the other guy has a knife or whatever so the fight just gets bigger and bloodier
2495875 we keep growing the heirloom plants that the shakers did like the large red tomato and yellow pear tomato
2495876 we sell produce now right from our garden so people will be able to experience heirloom vegetables from the strains the shakers grew with seeds that have been saved right here
2495877 our produce is competitively priced with other grocery stores its all organic we dont use any insecticides or fungicides we just try to keep it really clean and healthy for the environment and for the people that are eating it
2495878 the green grocer cart at hancock shaker village is a way for people to take home part of the garden experience and we hope that they get inspired to maybe grow their own vegetables and learn a little bit more about the techniques that we use
2495879 once a girl came up to me and told me she was going to hit me because i had apparently been flirting with her boyfriend i had just asked him to pass me a straw at the bar she was absolutely crazy i just started to cry and her boyfriend pulled her way
2495880 i cant fathom why a girl would want to fight or have conflict on a night out i can only guess that they just have no control and lose it in certain situations perhaps just as men want to be the alpha male maybe these girls want to be the alpha female
2495881 shes just had way too much to drink and always wants to start fights
2495882 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2495883 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
2495884 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
2495885 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

2495897 religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation it is the opium of the people
2495898 and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
2495899 we need to take faith seriously not simply to block the religious right but to engage all persons of faith in the larger project of american renewal
2495900 this stuff is just a headache for consumers when new buyers turn on their pcs theyre not expecting to see these buttons and icons and they become confused
2495901 on the other hand manufacturers dont want to turn away that free money
2495902 most people are shocked to find that after 90 days they actually have to buy the program
2495903 some customers are pretty vocal when it comes to having this kind of software on their new systems
2495904 our internal tests show that just uninstalling the preinstalled software that you dont want can improve a computers performance by 20 percent or more
2495905 were very aware of boot up times for our machines
2495906 weve identified which trial apps have caused a negative performance and either removed them or worked with the vendors to improve them
2495907 i think that puts a healthy perspective on the matter

2495920 most of us are just racing our own race plan and putting out what we want to put out for the first race i felt like i was going pretty hard i felt like id done a lot of work at the 1 000 meter mark but this is the first day after resting so that is always different

2495922 guerette is up against women in their mid to late 30s someone whos been an olympic champion since 1996 so its good to get in there and mix it up with them
2495923 im really looking forward to the eights said cummins 28 who finished behind romania and the favored german pair of lenka wech and maren derlien and were also edged at the line by great britain in their five boat heat
2495924 it was exciting to know we were in there against two really great crews
2495925 they both had good races and we felt like we had some really good parts against them
2495926 every time we go out against crews who are not our teammates its a great opportunity and were going to learn by leaps and bounds
2495927 it may be a little bit of a disadvantage but were learning to communicate we have a lot of fire and know what we want to get done out there were not scared of anyone
2495928 there are people without brains who do alot of talking
2495929 there are people without brains who do alot of talking
2495930 i dont think the british people have ever been broken by anything or anyone

2495936 its the kind of job where you take 25 30 out of somebodys pocket and people are hurting and they are
2495937 i am deeply concerned about taxicab commission president paul gillespies activity as of late president gillespies position on the commission is driver representative however he has been actively proposing new rules and regulations which clearly do not represent the interests of san franciscos taxicab drivers he is violating good faith i as a driver have never in the history of the taxicab commission have had my input solicited by president gillespie when i have had the opportunity to discuss driver needs with president gillespie he has been likely to press his own agenda and less than receptive i feel like president gillespie does not represent taxicab drivers and that the commission is out of line we do not have representation although paul is a driver he does not solicit driver feedback he is not receptive to driver representatives who should be his main agenda most recently paul was a proponent of the 5 00 gate increase by all taxi companies meanwhile the majority of the citys taxi drivers were obviously against a gate increase president gillespie has failed to fulfill the promise of health care to cab drivers and now i am understanding that he is proposing that only three cab companies be authorized to service san francisco basically forcing all of the citys cab drivers under the umbrella of three bosses all of which are notoriously corrupt he is reportedly against mayor newsoms and the majority of taxi drivers agenda for centralized dispatch claiming that the technology does not exist he is not just wrong he is clearly ignorant of the technology which is readily available and can easily be integrated into the citys 311 system i am sorry to say that i no longer have any faith whatsoever in president gillespies credibility again he does not represent the majority of the drivers he was appointed to represent i am asking that mayor newsom take emergency action to replace president gillespie on the taxicab commission with someone who truly represents san franciscos taxi drivers president gillespie is on a tear to further his own agenda before the taxicab commission is folded into the mta he is stomping onto our backs he is lost in his direction and i for one am more than disturbed by his agenda
2495938 transportation accounts for over half of san franciscos greenhouse gas emissions and it is imperative that we look to this sector for commensurate emissions reductions
2495939 the legislation i am signing today complements the pledge i made in 2006 for an all green taxi fleet and provides a mandate for cab companies to convert their vehicles
2495940 this legislation came about because the status quo gate cap cannot continue
2495941 im pleased we found a way to green the taxi cab industry without bankrupting the companies and without doing so on the backs of cab drivers
2495942 this legislation is expected to increase that percentage to 100 by 2011
2495943 im pleased we found a way to green the taxi cab industry without bankrupting the companies and without doing so on the backs of cab drivers
2495944 taxi drivers call for 1 fuel surcharge tlc says no way
2495945 if the cab companies were paying for the gas then wed all be driving priusus
2495946 its obvious what has happened here you dont need to be a rocket scientist
2495947 i dont think malaysia can afford to have a prime minister who has a huge question mark hanging over his head is he or not involved in the murder of this girl
2495948 desperate and pathetic attempt to discredit and taint my political image

2495950 desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences
2495951 were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2495952 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2495953 my sense is thats going to be their top priority
2495954 give russia the message that invading the territory of a sovereign state and bombing its territory is unacceptable in the 21st century

2495968 we need attention to the difficulty increases which are too much
2495969 id like gymnastics to remain artistic that we dont lose this part the artistic it is not only a sport of biomechanical performance expressivity must remain
2495970 we have attained 20 more places to admit other athletes and ensure universality in gymnastics
2495971 it will be more complicated than the other one against ivory coast
2495972 that day it was very hot on sunday we have to control the ball and let the opponents run
2495973 we cant get anxious and we must wait for the right moment to attack
2495974 we havent seen much of australia but we know they are big guys
2495975 we have to be careful as we are a team that tries to play good soccer we are not a physical team
2495976 i want some fresh legs we are up against the reigning world under 21 champions and current olympic gold medalists so there will be a couple of changes probably
2495977 we are thinking of adding another midfielder maybe playing with just one up front i think we need to add a bit more bite in midfield the adrenaline is running through them they have a wonderful opportunity to play against the likes of messi riquelme and mascherano it will be good
2495978 we have got to stay compact we cant give away any space in between midfield and defense for messi and lautaro aguero and riquelme to drop into
2495979 we have to work together as a team and keep the ball

2495989 his view was that you couldnt be a specialist in every discipline within the sport
2495990 he understood the basics of biomechanics and eventually became an extremely capable physiologist but he didnt spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about those issues he found people who could spend time worrying about them while he concentrated on the coaching and bringing the team together
2495991 in the world of coaching and inspiring and influencing there are few men in the history of british athletics of whom it could be said that they were truly among the greatest
2495992 peter coes contribution to sebs success to british athletics and to everyone who had the privilege of knowing him was always of gold medal standard
2495993 at the moment i dont see any candidates certainly from the bn anwar is going to win but what will be interesting is the margin whether it is bigger or less votes than what he anwar obtained previously
2495994 however if the majority obtained by anwar has declined umno can make headway to regain the peoples support
2495995 no way i have resigned in 2003 and i have said that im not coming back but i have the right as a citizen to make comments on my country
2495996 it depends on who is standing if he is from a pas splinter the possibility is that it will reduce anwars votes if the candidate is a former umno member it will give anwar a bigger majority but there is no possibility of the independent candidate winning
2495997 ku li should gauge the members support i find that only the lower levels are supporting him on the other hand pak lah gets the support of the umno divisional heads to the extent that they cannot open their mouth at all

2496003 such was marcus whitman the missionary hero to plead that the state should acquire the empire that the churches were gaining for christianity never in the history of the world has there been a finer example of civilization following christianity the missionaries led under the banner of the cross and the settlers moved close behind under the star spangled symbol of the nation

2496030 our coaches and players worked extremely hard this season and together we accomplished many great things

2496032 our coaches and players worked extremely hard this season and together we accomplished many great things
2496033 our fans were also terrific throughout the year and we wanted to have a celebration in a venue that could hold as many of those fans as possible were all looking forward to a great evening
2496034 to receive an award in the name of bear bryant is special to me im really thankful that among these great coaches who were up for this award im the one who received it
2496035 the most important part of this award is the coaches and players who helped make this happen
2496036 we have some very talented young men and we have some who just go out and play hard any coach will tell you that the better the players the better the coach
2496037 not only did he talk about how great a coach bryant was but also what he meant to him as a man
2496038 ive had a lot of 18 to 20 hour days but im excited about it
2496039 you dont get to the orange bowl without being a great football team and having a great season so weve got to respect our opponent and that is the one thing weve always preached at virginia tech
2496040 most people havent expected this from a kansas football team
2496041 most people thought our basketball team was pretty good but nobody expected us to be here
2496042 just look at the stats this is a really good football team
2496043 at texas a amp m they have 90 000 cadets going crazy but no matter what at the end of the day its just a game no matter how big the stadium is and how crazy the venue its just a game
2496044 our players understand when its time to work and when its time to have fun theyve been able to do that all season long and this wont change
2496045 i think kansas not being in this position before it makes them a little more excited anticipating that day im sure theyre preparing as hard as they can weve got to match that being too comfortable can get you in trouble
2496046 wir m ssen nun schauen dass wir im spiel bleiben und uns nach vorne noch verbessern mehr pr zision reinbekommen wir sind aber auf einem guten weg
2496047 eu gostaria de jogar contra o brasil na final mas temos que ganhar muitas partidas primeiro temos que nos classificar para as quartas de final

2496049 n o foi 100 por cento mas o importante foi a vit ria
2496050 since when is 11 1 not good enough to play in a bcs bowl
2496051 i cant be concerned about other teams because i dont have control over other teams or the process
2496052 its arguably one of the best seasons ever maybe the best ever at the university of kansas but its not over we got one more game to play this game is really important to our players they want to play well and win on a national stage
2496053 the sun is hot people were spraying water on the airplane it was nice
2496054 theyre athletic speedy play very well on defense great special teams some really talented kids on offense and its a very good team
2496055 were trying to change the way people think about kansas football just the way coach beamer changed the way people think about virginia tech football
2496056 the quality of a schools publications and how they present themselves to their reading community is a guidepost to the quality of the school
2496057 its an honor to receive this recognition it proves that hard work and dedication really do pay off
2496058 as a minor the current program introduces siena students to careers in either electronic journalism or film
2496059 the hope is the program will soon become a major called something like electronic media and school administrators hope the introduction of professors like smith who has teaching and field experience will help enhance the interest in communications on sienas campus
2496060 one of my main concerns will be to enhance the service from the sctv channels with a wide variety of program content that is both student generated and from other sources
2496061 what a great way to learn about making television and video
2496062 electronic journalism covers a variety of important and rewarding careers everything from on air reporting in radio or television to the newer field of online journalism the field is constantly changing it is an exciting new media world and siena students need to know more about this new way of doing journalism
2496063 both ilibagiza and barba have done great things for their communities
2496064 there are many connections that can be made between what these two individuals have accomplished and what siena college stands for
2496065 especially in the long winters here the school is concerned about the high potential for accidents when the weather is bad
2496066 we hope to get the design done this year and then get the shovel in the ground next year

2496107 traditional clothing represents a tighter family unit and this may offer some protection against some of the pressures that young people face
2496108 what it suggests is that we need to assist people who are moving from traditional cultures and becoming integrated into western societies as they may be more vulnerable to mental health problems
2496109 there are many ways in which people can be british these girls who have good mental health and still have a strong traditional culture are by implication settled and comfortable with their identities

2496120 chancellor angela merkel has urged the conflict parties in south ossetia to show calm and restraint and called for an immediate stop to all use of force
2496121 the president believes that any interference in internal matters of the republic of georgia is unacceptable and that any such action if it intensifies could lead to tragic consequences

2496129 how about something like the world peace reality show where everyone goes around and tries to create peace in different countries

2496168 todos saben que es un equipo que por plantilla est entre los grandes
2496169 tengo ganas de empezar ya quiero conocer cuanto antes a los compa eros y entrenar con el equipo creo que el sevilla est haciendo las cosas bien ante equipos importantes esta pretemporada adem s todos saben que es un equipo que por plantilla est entre los grandes
2496170 llego en el mejor momento de mi carrera pero eso tengo que demostrarlo sobre el c sped tuve la posibilidad de marcharme a otros clubes pero cuando sali lo del sevilla no lo dud ten a claro que quer a seguir en espa a e hice todo lo posible para venir a este gran club
2496171 soy de la opini n de que no hay que marcarse ninguna meta prefiero pensar en cada entrenamiento y en cada partido porque s que los objetivos llegar n con el trabajo
2496172 he jugado varias veces en este estadio s que la afici n vive el f tbol muy fuerte y con mucha pasi n a todos los argentinos nos enorgullece vestir la misma camiseta que diego maradona es algo muy lindo para nosotros
2496173 absolutely for me tv experience is a must preferably of long hour stuff but at least something of eastenders level in terms of schedule gruellingness et cetera
2496174 not a pre requisite as such however i would think it fairly unlikely for a writer to get a commission with little or no previous television experience
2496175 casualty is 50 minutes of prime time tv drama i would feel uneasy about offering a commission to someone with no tv experience at all that doesnt mean its impossible but i think it would only happen in exceptional circumstances this is as much for the writers sake as anything else writing a first episode of anything is a learning curve and most people who write for the show have written other tv before though they may never have written as much as 50 minutes before or may not have written for a series before
2496176 i did already have a tv commission yes but i know that radio and stage would have got me there and still could casualty will never turn away a good writer its always a show which looks for talent never more so than now
2496177 personally i dont have strict rules about what i will and wont read however its a good idea to submit something that demonstrates the kind of skills that will be needed when writing on the show for example its not a bad idea to submit something that shows an ability to multi strand so there is more than one story playing out id also be looking for good characterisation strong narrative drive a story that plays out dramatically in the present rather than relying on heavy exposition or flashbacks an ability to structure the story so that its pacy and holds your interest sparky dialogue and characters that you can empathise and get involved with
2496178 dont try and second guess what people want dont write a medical drama unless thats what you want to write about write something you care about something you want to tell people about care about it passionately re write it endlessly give it to friends not just the nice ones to read and re write finally after youre into double figures for your drafts put it away for a couple of weeks pull it out of the drawer and read it as though its been written by someone else and if after all that you think theres nothing else you want to change to make it better then send it out
2496179 be so passionate that they cannot not listen to you be ambitious and confident with 48 episodes a year every year if you are good enough they need you ask to come to the warehouse meet people be brave and bold and show how keen and committed you are
2496180 its pot luck as far as i can see whether you contact someone at the right time or whether your script or email hits the top of the pile just when they need a writer

2496190 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2496191 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2496192 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2496193 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2496194 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2496195 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2496196 tough are you kidding if i really wanted to unload i could have i think most people in this country have a special thought for a guy cheating on his wife especially when she has cancer
2496197 die befreiten sind von den strapazen der geiselhaft gezeichnet aber es geht beiden den umst nden entsprechend gut
2496198 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2496199 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2496200 beijings air quality is not up to what the world is expecting from an olympic host city the sports teams have reason to be concerned
2496201 enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
2496202 in view of my responsibilities i have lost some of my freedom of speech
2496203 we must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the american eagle in order to feather their own nests
2496204 if i were you id like to think id wait be patient and watch the real version when it was available its definitely something weve had conversations about the most important thing for us is that wed be able to do show as weve always done it
2496205 running time is one thing having more story time there are other possibilities concerning content that well consider
2496206 we felt like this is what the show was always about from the very beginning as true to life and authentic as possible as much as we love scott and gaius we had to be true to whats happening to these characters
2496207 being in the thrid year of the show and have it live to this point it was time to start to take things seriously about what grade they were in we blurred the lines a little bit to tell stories but now were making a commitment
2496208 from the beginning jason said wed do show for only a few years
2496209 we fely like if we started from where we left off there was an arc of stories we could tell but it felt too weird to tell those stories
2496210 and then move forward eight months we didnt plan for it but there was something interesting about cutting ahead
2496211 having to cut the season short in december because of the strike that was kind of devestating
2496212 we didnt get to finish the season we said goodbye and we didnt know if it was last time or not
2496213 typically when we have childlabor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
2496214 i would put her in a coma thats what i would do
2496215 so literally i was at a baseball game with steve mcpherson and the most surprising part of this story would be that i was at a baseball game
2496216 carlton and i were on the writers guild negotiating committee together and we would be in this room trying to plot strategy against the producers alliance and people would always go okay look its the fourth down we have to approach this i go why is it all sports metaphors why doesnt anybody use musical theater metaphors so i actually got them to try to use eliza doolittle as a comparison on occasion
2496217 all the difference in the world we now basically knew exactly how much time we had left to tell our story and we were basically able to blast towards that ending i think that really completely changed our storytelling approach
2496218 the thing that was just so sad was that a writer one of you guys saw it but from one perspective
2496219 weve killed a lot of white people i can almost guarantee you we will be killing more white people this season
2496220 hopefully as it plays out people wont feel that way and we certainly arent designing the story in the same way
2496221 i got a call from abc entertainment chief steve mcpherson saying that cashmere mafia was most likely not going to come back and that he still wanted to work with me and keep me in the family
2496222 i think hopefully the first episode will allow it will work for returning viewers but it also will work for new viewers theres no learning curve to come back to the show and i think that will work for you know we will work very quickly the audience will be here
2496223 i was shocked when that all went down far moreso than i ever was with the president clinton its shocking because every time ive been with a hooker theres never been any electronic trail whatsoever
2496224 i mean if im not that stupid how could he be that stupid the guy graduated from frickin harvard you know what i mean
2496225 this season were honing in on really making it a show that the stories tell more of the ethical dilemmas that our doctors have to face there is surgery in it because addison is a surgeon and she gets back to doing that
2496226 for me the thing about writing is that the characters end up sort of doing what im doing at the moment and the first season we were it was the first time id had two shows going at the same time it was the first time addison moved to los angeles it was addison finding her footing i was finding the show so i feel like both of those things are stronger now
2496227 it sort of dawned on me a few days ago we were shooting im like oh addison has never been happy personally shes never had anybody that really likes her derek was like get away and karev was just a curmudgeon so now theres actually some kind of fun and love and romance
2496228 we found out a little about what both berlanti and pp creator shonda rhimes have in store and how they deal with returning from such a long break
2496229 we do think theres an opportunity after this eighth season
2496230 if any or all the cast is a part of that i think theres a growth opportunity there its a show that despite being moved around into like 17 time periods and really never being given the marketing support has really performed unbelievably well on nbc
2496231 we have kind of the advantage going in that we felt that we really had a dominant fall and a real strong core schedule so we didnt need that much new programming
2496232 and we also decided really early on that we werent going to kind of announce in may shows that didnt exist that hadnt been developed or shot or piloted and gone through the regular process
2496233 but were really just going to do things when theyre ready we still have windows of opportunity to launch shows i dont think its going to be a process where you are just going to have randomly pilots throughout the year
2496234 it gave us a lot more prep time on the writing side and enabled us to get to more episodes before summer end you know we were looking at the possibility of the sag strike and it allowed a little bit of protection against that
2496235 there was a lot of talking a lot of time in the coffee room taking about the angst thats not that show its not what shonda rhimes the creator does well
2496236 i think its unfortunate when theres any kind of turmoil on a show theres so many people who work so unbelievably hard to make that show the 1 show in the country everyone from the grips to the writers to the eps i think deserves an enormous amount of credit and i never like to see when any of them are in any way taken lightly so i think that was really unfortunate
2496237 which is really much more in keeping with what we wanted to get accomplished originally
2496238 i think the second seasons first episode back when we saw the rough cut i dont think they were personally what anybody wanted
2496239 i think sometimes when were really passionate about things we try to convince ourselves that theres a real audience for them
2496240 i applaud cbs for jericho there was a huge groundswell but groundswell and success dont necessarily match up
2496241 they didnt have to fill some undetermined middle of the show
2496242 i really like being able to know when shows are going out i think its as big a decision as a lost decision a couple years out its really good to know as opposed to doing you know with scrubs is it on again is it going to not be on lets let these creators who have created unbelievably compelling characters and iconic pieces of television lets let them end it with dignity and integrity and to me compelling content and we can market it as such
2496243 when pigs fly the death of oink the birth of dissent and a brief history of record industry suicide
2496244 we understand that these are just music fans trying to listen to as much music as they can but we have to protect our assets and were working on an industry wide solution to accommodate the changing needs of music fans
2496245 this was not a case of friends sharing music for pleasure
2496246 we played to a room full of suits who were madly texting on their blackberrys the entire time
2496247 after the set the curtains closed and jordan schur then president of geffen records ran onstage he was immediately stopped by security but just barreled through them
2496248 he was like i gotta have this band with his arms wide open and all that
2496249 every time matt had a suggestion lord alge would just point at the wall of platinum and gold records he wouldnt even talk
2496250 in hindsight ocaseks mix may have been better but it wasnt really thick or big which was what the label wanted
2496251 they were like it has to sound like a blink 182 record
2496252 fuck them we will stick to basements and what we want to do for our fans
2496253 we were on trl in april 2006 and the fuckin record comes out in august 2006 so this songs being played on the radio like a motherfucker
2496254 and there was no product you couldnt go anywhere and get it we did the whole fucking warped tour with a single and no product wed sell some copies of hot pink but we kept thinking we were gonna have teenage graffiti but do you sell this album with all these original recordings of the songs on it its gonna confuse people
2496255 it was funny cause the motorola reps were like we cant get any bands to hold the gear
2496256 highly anticipated american version of the british hit life on mars

2496268 chewbacca and princess leia affair revealed after 28 year cover up
2496269 i love it you love it unfortunately no one watches it thats the thing with shows people have to watch them were nbc we have a reputation to uphold and man with this writers strike well well see what we can do but start watching 30 rock
2496270 too bad as its the only decent drama on television
2496271 since the pilot i felt like the show had some of the best potential for storytelling and exploration of characters both on the light and the dark side
2496272 its more about keeping all the best elements and adding as much intrigue drama and danger as we possibly can
2496273 there is a real desire to essentially relaunch oreo said

2496291 the june 4 suspension of humanitarian operations is estimated to have affected more than 1 5 million zimbabweans already

2496299 last season wasnt he supposed to be intelligent and logical
2496300 apart from his housing troubles i thought eric making tim his gofer was pretty funny especially his comments at the gymnastics meet about stacies double backs of course that does call into question tamis earlier concerns about his grades
2496301 i know what you did last fall by the grocery store
2496302 a guy travels through time trying to make right what once went wrong
2496303 i dont think ive ever said this but that seems overpriced
2496304 the output is a very clear understanding of what the system should look like the project has developed an entire system concept and a related reference design for a future air interface this can be used as input for the standardisation process that is now starting
2496305 no one had anything to lose and therefore we could start a joint development of a new system where everyone could bring in their ideas
2496306 we started more or less from zero so everyone could gain something
2496307 our industry partners went to the lte standardisation and many organisations have taken winner results because we already achieved some consensus there these kinds of projects are supporting consensus building
2496308 basically youll get in a wireless system a similar experience as in your office or your home
2496309 in europe this may not happen before 2015 though in some countries it could be earlier
2496310 it really depends on conditions in different countries and also on market needs of course
2496311 asia is still growing fast but in ten years they will also have a saturated market the need then will be to improve the capabilities of systems from an industry perspective we have to offer innovative solutions in order to stay competitive in the global market
2496312 i think we have to work hard of course but there is a good chance because we have the people the know how and the means for this kind of co operation
2496313 what industry has to do is invest in research and development in order to stay inventive
2496314 technology is always moving its always improving we can decide either to be in the group which is improving and innovating or we are not in that group i think its better to be in the group thats improving

2496336 well between the bad service and the refill charge we were really not happy with our service

2496364 in the arts of painting graphic design and photography color theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual impact of specific color combinations
2496365 color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions concepts and design applications all the information would fill several encyclopedias as an introduction here are a few basic concepts
2496366 for a long time now there has been a problem that fledgling designers have run into on a constant basis
2496367 color theory is a set of principles used to create harmonious color combinations color relationships can be visually represented with a color wheel the color spectrum wrapped onto a circle
2496368 in an age like ours color is not the luxury it was in past centuries
2496369 with colors you can set a mood attract attention or make a statement you can use color to energize or to cool down by selecting the right color scheme you can create an ambiance of elegance warmth or tranquility or you can convey an image of playful youthfulness color can be your most powerful design element if you learn to use it effectively
2496370 color is a phenomenon of light caused by how our eyes detect differing qualities of projected or reflected light because science and technology has allowed us to understand the physiology of the human eye to measure wavelengths of light and chart energy patterns we have come a long way in grasping the complexities of color please find below how we define the dimensions of color in terms of hue lightness saturation and other characteristics of light while this article is not the most comprehensive text on color we hope it serves to increase your understanding of it
2496371 in color theory we often talk about the color wheel
2496372 if you are involved in the creation or design of visual documents an understanding of color will help when incorporating it into your own designs
2496373 color theory may sound like a subject for the art department not for developers but weve all had the experience of choosing a color scheme using the property grid to select named colors and ending up with a really garish color scheme in an ideal world it might be the case that only our softwares functionality really mattered but in the world that we actually live in users are likely to prefer software with a sophisticated color scheme over software with an ugly color scheme
2496374 now i cant relate an entire course here nor would i be qualified to do so however i will lay down some important primer and definitions garnered from my own personal education and experience as well as various resource materials the following color theory is based more on subtractive color which is the color we see around us in a day to day life or used in painting printing etc additive theory involves red green blue what we see on screen and produced by video devices
2496375 the quality of an object or substance with respect to light reflected by the object usually determined visually by measurement of hue saturation and brightness of the reflected light saturation or chroma hue
2496376 the entire electromagnetic spectrum is made up of ultraviolet visible light and infrared

2496546 of thy gods tis said mouths they have but speak not
2496547 if thy god hath all these attributes why does he not deliver thee from my power
2496548 he delivered chananyah and his companions from the power of nebuchadnezzar but they were righteous men and nebuchadnezzar was a king deserving of seeing a miracle performed but for me alas i am not worthy of redemption neither art thou worthy of a demonstration of gods power
2496549 oh cruel king let me fold him in my arms ere thou destroyest his innocent young life

2496553 there are many legends and stories as to how the how the hanukkah dreidel came to be invented one though maybe not totally true serves to accentuate the story of the maccabees and the revolt against the greeks

2496555 yeah my teacher told me that too my mom wont let me open anything until christmas
2496556 finally everyones being paid like a new york lawyer thanks to an informal wage freeze in the countrys largest market midlevels in other major cities caught up to the salaries of their new york counterparts this year although they still lag behind in bonuses

2496558 compensation is too low for the new york office notes one blank rome associate the bonus is not a market bonus even if the salary is a market salary says another
2496559 students cant easily differentiate between prospective employers so they rely too much on pay as an indicator of prestige
2496560 the most uneducated consumers of law firm life and what it really means to practice
2496561 only a few will make equity partner and most will have a limited amount of time at a big firm
2496562 t he message from management was were just doing the raise because the market is doing it
2496563 theyre not raising because they value us were just the collective beneficiary because the firm needs to keep up in the market its a back handed compliment
2496564 a pie eating contest where the reward is more pie

2496570 what is it that we can offer these high achievers that will appeal to them
2496571 we try to make it a very high impact experience
2496572 its very rare for them to come and listen to hours of powerpoint presentations

2496587 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2496588 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2496589 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2496590 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2496591 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2496592 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2496593 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2496594 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2496595 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together
2496596 going to meet the principals basically to update them on the progress so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2496597 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the interparty dialogue
2496598 the legal process of producing a government in zimbabwe has failed those who claim to represent a government in zimbabwe should be excluded from attending sadc and african union meetings as their participation in these meetings would be equal to giving them unqualified legitimacy
2496599 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2496600 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2496601 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2496602 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2496603 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas
2496604 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2496605 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics

2496610 less than 1 of content items played by ipod users on either itunes or the device itself were videos among video ipod users that percentage barely improves up to 2 2
2496611 worst case scenario the panel is an early indication that tv and movies have limited appeal on ipods best case scenario while adoption of video may be proceeding more slowly than the hype suggests there is tremendous upside ahead
2496612 cmon lets go deal with my dad watching fat people on tv
2496613 my manager told me i couldnt keep going out and partying all the time because we have to be more professional and i think i was getting a little bit carried away with myself

2496681 it definitely wouldnt be information that was intended for him or for anyone for that matter
2496682 the information you are in possession of is obviously sensitive and sharing that outside of you having it now could jeopardize the safety of members
2496683 im not sure what the call out was for but i dont want to see somebody get hurt over this
2496684 it seems like a rather significant screw up im not sure if the screw up is with bell or aliant the provider of our pager or whether its even related
2496685 i think his number was probably put in there in error

2496708 as comic fans weve known since we were little kids how great comics are with this game we have the opportunity to show everyone else how cool the dc universe is
2496709 if we have a big storyline happening in the summer you might see that in the game later i have a staff position at dc and we have a short list of characters that well update first in the game and then in the comics
2496710 the biggest fantasy players can have is to be an equal of superman not necessarily to play as superman
2496711 when you pick up a bus and throw it across metropolis hundreds of thousands of players will be able to see this and many of them will have to dodge this projectile for their safety
2496712 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2496713 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big

2496719 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2496720 i was shocked to read about st michaels hospice nurse sue marshs recent experience of having concrete hurled at her car this was dangerous and mindless and is not representative of how lots of our young people behave
2496721 new proposals from the lib dems will go a long way towards reducing youth crime by having more police and by focusing on crime hotspots we will be able to deter crime more effectively
2496722 but we also need to give young people positive alternatives to do too often they get into trouble because there is nothing for them to get stuck in to the local play pathfinder is a step in the right direction and the proposed youth volunteer force will be a great way to get young people involved in activities that benefit themselves and the area where they live
2496723 i am also keen to ensure that those who do break the law or cause disturbances or vandalism have to pay back the community they have wronged
2496724 that is why restorative justice is important it will mean that those convicted of offences will have to work to clean up vandalism or on projects that benefit the community as a whole
2496725 residents in hastings and in rye are contacting me with their worries about youth crime i believe that the proposals the liberal democrats have put forward will help to address these problems and concerns
2496726 this is insanity it is grossly overreacting on the part of the hill
2496727 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2496728 britney looked really good it was improvisational questions and answers with host russell brand just like other promo guest stars ll cool j and pete wentz did russell joked about there being sexual tension and britney shot back i dont feel the tension the other joke was about no one knowing who russell was so she called him by the wrong name ll called him russell bland and britney called him russell brown
2496729 the joke of the whole thing is there is an elephant in the room

2496732 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2496733 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2496734 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2496735 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis

2496738 the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people
2496739 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
2496740 congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare but only those specifically enumerated
2496741 constitutions should consist only of general provisions the reason is that they must necessarily be permanent and that they cannot calculate for the possible change of things
2496742 a wise and frugal government which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor and bread it has earned this is the sum of good government
2496743 if congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money and will promote the general welfare the government is no longer a limited one possessing enumerated powers but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions
2496744 i see and with the deepest affliction the rapid strides with which the federal branch of our government is advancing towards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the states and the consolidation in itself of all powers foreign and domestic and that too by constructions which if legitimate leave no limits to their power it is but too evident that the three ruling branches of the federal government are in combination to strip their colleagues the state authorities of the powers reserved by them and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic
2496745 whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are unauthoritative void and of no force
2496746 the purpose of a written constitution is to bind up the several branches of government by certain laws which when they transgress their acts shall become nullities to render unnecessary an appeal to the people or in other words a rebellion on every infraction of their rights on the peril that their acquiescence shall be construed into an intention to surrender those rights
2496747 now mark my words so long as we are a young and virtuous people this instrument will bind us together in mutual interests mutual welfare and mutual happiness but when we become old and corrupt it will bind no longer
2496748 it makes no difference who you vote for the two parties are really one party representing four percent of the people

2496758 part of our governments approach to cutting greenhouse gases is to find new and innovative ways to rise to this important challenge
2496759 canadas offset system is a key component of our turning the corner action plan to help reduce canadas emissions an absolute 20 by 2020
2496760 some people have over the course of the summer been talking a good game when it comes to cutting greenhouse gases
2496761 while others talk our government is taking real action to put the regulations in place to make the turning the corner plan a reality

2496763 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

2496767 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2496768 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2496769 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2496770 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2496772 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2496773 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2496774 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2496775 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2496776 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2496778 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
2496779 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2496780 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel

2496782 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2496783 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2496784 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2496785 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2496786 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2496787 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2496788 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2496789 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2496790 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2496791 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2496792 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2496793 im very happy even though some people are uneasy im satisfied and this time i just wanted to win a medal
2496794 before i could reveal the tibetan flag four to five uniformed staff shoved me on the ground
2496795 others raised a big piece of cloth around me to block the view from the spectators
2496796 my dress is torn and my arm is full of scratches they dont need to so violently force me out
2496797 no form of unauthorized publicity commercial or otherwise and no form of political propaganda appearing on flags banners clothing sportswear accessories or more generally on any article of clothing or equipment whatsoever worn or used by spectators athletes or other participants in the events is permitted

2496808 be informed that our client has successfully served and voluntarily retired from the service of the nigerian armed forces having been discharged satisfactorily by the relevant authorities concerned
2496809 as a matter of fact there is never any record from the nigerian army showing or buttressing your allegation
2496810 we find this to be a serious campaign of calumny against our client this has occasioned serious injury to the reputation and character of our client and which is highly unacceptable
2496811 we shall also not hesitate to interpret your action to breach of the oaths act in force by deposing to nonexisting fact

2496847 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2496848 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2496849 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2496850 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2496851 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship in the breaking of the bread and in prayers now all who believed were together and had all things in common and sold their possessions and goods and divided them among all as anyone had neeed
2496852 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2496853 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2496854 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2496855 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2496878 in addition to internet usage growing much faster outside the u s countries that have the strongest purchasing power are also outside the u s like those in the european union
2496879 international purchasers are able to pay a higher price point these days merchants have the ability to reach the basis of consumers in the world where internet usage is growing and the ability to reach a customer base able to spend more for each product than a u s consumer
2496880 u s consumers going through one merchant are being charged 34 99 for that book u k customers going through the same merchant are being charged 25 99 pounds equivalent to 49 29 to the merchant
2496881 want to expand their base outside the u s can turn u k buyers for example into browsers just by showing them what theyll pay in sterling pounds
2496882 by doing that alone our merchants have seen a 2 to 25 percent increase in their international sales by simply adding foreign currency pricing theyre effectively converting more browsers into buyers because it either looks like its in their country or at least its intended for people in that country
2496883 if the merchant already has international customers on its website and its charging them in u s dollars its effectively giving them a discount those international customers often are willing to pay different price points then on u s currency
2496884 with us everything is u s based and consolidated on the u s site the reconciliation is very simple and there are no foreign banks involved
2496885 the protocol for figuring out multi currency conversion is not easy
2496886 so if you find a shopping cart platform that can do this its a big deal
2496887 we now can work with nearly any currency and pretty much any shipping company
2496888 so the merchants we work with are starting to sell in russia israel norway branching out into other countries now that weve got this ironed out
2496889 the international site can have a different set of graphics templates language settings and currency conversions
2496890 whatever you have in english you press a button and create a whole new set of templates which are then translated by the merchant into the new language the currency is dynamic so thats done automatically
2496891 the best way weve seen is driving traffic by using geo ip
2496892 based on the internet protocol address the system populates the currency based on the shoppers geographical location
2496893 the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves but wiser people so full of doubts

2497137 the people there are able to live freely again without intimidation and extortion by militias
2497138 what you saw and what youre seeing now in mosul and diyala is a more determined enemy in terms of holding ground
2497139 the iraqis are really developing and have come a long way
2497140 it takes a while to develop the kind of leadership theyve shown were focusing on that key leadership and bolstering them so we have a vibrant and successful counterinsurgency force
2497141 this cooperative effort which began july 27 partially destroyed the remnants of aqi along the northern tigris river valley and brought a prolonged military presence to the people in those regions not seen in over 3 years
2497142 this is the first time that we have had iraqi sf and cf in hegnah because of their commitment to our people we are able to live in peace and begin rebuilding our lives without fear
2497143 we need to get some form of representative govt established in taq taq or we will continue to see that area of salah ad din susceptible to aqi exploitation and usage as a safe haven
2497144 if we can at least get the process started for these people that will be the single most enduring accomplishment we will have fulfilled in this op

2497173 said that when the helicopter was about to land he saw so many guerrillas that he got terribly nervous and fearing for his life he pulled a piece of cloth with the red cross emblem out of his pocket and put it over his vest
2497174 it is serious that in the initial investigation of the operation the whole truth did not emerge
2497175 serious concern over what appears to have been a deliberate misuse of the red cross emblem
2497176 if authenticated these images would clearly establish an improper use of the red cross emblem which we deplore
2497177 complete and total respect for the red cross emblem is essential if the icrc is to be able to bring assistance and protection to the people worst affected by armed conflicts and other situations of violence
2497178 should not tarnish the results of the operation which we are all still celebrating
2497179 the information initially obtained from the presidents office was apparently not so accurate
2497180 the emblem was misused with the wrong intentions that is not a good thing because humanitarian efforts could be affected
2497181 a violation of international humanitarian law whether or not it generates security problems
2497182 we have told the whole truth operation check was planned and implemented by the colombian army using members of the army and emerged from army intelligence

2497272 the simple appeal to europes diversity will not be enough since many of the problems which diversity is intended to solve are produced by the very national models that are regarded as the carriers of diversity a step in the right direction would be an intercultural dialogue regarding the different european understandings of diversity and an exploration of ways to reconcile the divergent western central and eastern approaches to cultural diversity

2497278 if you want to have a diverse industry youre going to have to encourage some directors to go for it to be bold and challenge an audience
2497279 theres no doubt that the book of revelation is going to very much divide an audience the same goes for 2 37
2497280 it almost shocks you into thinking about the trauma he experiences in a way that profoundly takes you into another place in terms of the darker elements that exist within us all
2497281 cinema at the moment tends to be a bit bland
2497282 for audiences wanting to go and lose themselves in an experience its a film that offers you the possibility to do that
2497283 i think ive walked a very fine line between explicitness because its necessary and part of the storytelling while doing it in such a way that the audience can actually be involved and not have to look away
2497284 it seems to be a no go zone an area we dont want to explore or examine but i actually think sexuality is one of the most fascinating areas of what it means to be a human being were all engaged with it on some level and therefore it becomes a very potent place to find out who we are what makes us tick
2497285 the nearest structure socially to a medieval structure is the criminal hierarchy
2497286 of all shakespeares plays its the most in your face
2497287 there are no subplots its very linear in certain ways its very simple
2497288 if i had four people out of 100 walk out of that scene because ive gone over into the dark side to prove a point thats all right if i had 20 people walk out id probably go to the producers and say excuse me i think we should reshoot this but 4 per cent losses are ok
2497289 i see it that im a guy the censors like to step up to its not that there is more violence in what i do than other products its just that theres a psychological feel to them if you see macbeth on stage itll have the same number of murders in it
2497290 once you say that sam worthington is playing a gangster you ask yourself who is he going to be seduced and conned by not by three crones but by three extrovert teenage girls thats the easiest way to distract a gangster if hes straight
2497291 to take a crackpot subculture and create something dynamic and graphic around it you were seen as some kind of cultural traitor but it was too easy to be controversial in australia in those days australian films were expected to be tame and timid
2497292 weve always had a tendency to have a vision of ourselves as somehow innocent but if you look at the history of this country were not at all if theres a war going on anywhere in the world we want to get in there and get involved we like to see ourselves as a fun loving and suntanned sports crazy kind of innocent people but thats all bullshit were a very complicated piece of machinery
2497293 im not a provocateur not in any calculated way what you see is a genuine distillation of my own impulses there are filmmakers in this country who calculate very carefully the impact they can create by doing a certain kind of movie im actually kind of gauche and naive that way i do what i like and hope that someone out there is entertained by it
2497294 i had to show everything for the pure reason that if i did it as a cut and a gasp and its over it would have been irresponsible that would imply that suicide is easy
2497295 i wanted to show the gore i wanted to show the brutality i wanted to show the suffering but the main thing i wanted to show was the regret as the character is dying shes mouthing the words help me help me if anything i see that suicide scene as a massive deterrent to anyone whos thinking of doing it
2497296 singfest is the music event that all singaporeans should look forward to every year

2497298 do you like doing everything in a gruop and being part of a gang
2497299 but as theyve gotten older especially recently theyre really particular about the type of clothes they wear they want to be their own individual

2497301 weve never dressed them alike except maybe once or twice weve always encouraged them to find their own fashion but they have a tendency to get the same type of things because its just easier for me to buy four of the something for the boys and two matching items for the girls

2497319 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2497320 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2497321 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2497322 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2497323 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2497324 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2497325 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2497326 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2497336 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people

2497341 aku telah menyetujui perjanjian itu dan berjanji bahwa aku akan tetap teguh dalam keimanan beribadah dan memenuhi perintah mu dan aku berpegang setia kepadanya dengan mengetahui bahwa allah tidak akan memberikan beban kepada jiwaku lebih besar dari yang mampu dipikulnya
2497342 ya allah aku senantiasa menepati janji yang engkau buat atasku dalam hal keimanan dan aku akan setia berpegang kepadanya dan mengikutinya selama aku mampu
2497343 apabila aku memerintahkan kalian dengan sesuatu maka kerjakanlah semampu kalian dan apapun yang aku larang dari kalian maka tinggakanlah
2497344 dan apa saja nikmat yang ada pada kamu maka dari allah lah datangnya
2497345 sesungguhnya jika kamu bersyukur pasti kami akan menambah nikmat kepadamu dan jika kamu mengingkari nikmat ku maka sesungguhnya azab ku sangat pedih
2497346 aku memasuki pagi diantara nikmat nikmat dan dosa dosa maka aku ingin menyegerakan syukur atas nikmat nikmat dan memohon ampun atas dosa dosa
2497347 apabila seorang hamba mengakui dosanya dan bertaubat maka allah menerima taubatnya
2497348 maka ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya tidak ada ilah sesembahan tuhan selain allah dan mohonlah ampunan bagi dosamu dan bagi dosa orang orang mumin laki laki dan perempuan dan allah mengetahui tempat kamu berusaha dan tempat kamu tinggal
2497349 maka tetaplah pada jalan yang lurus menuju kepadanya dan mohonlah ampun kepadanya
2497350 ya allah engkau adalah tuhanku tidak ada tuhan yang wajib disembah kecuali engkau engkau menciptakanku dan aku adalah hamba mu aku senantiasa menepati janji mu selama aku mampu aku berlindung kepada mu dari perbuatanku yang jelek aku mengakui kepada mu nikmat mu kepadaku dan aku mengakui dosaku kepada mu maka ampunilah aku karena sesungguhnya tidak ada yang dapat mengampuni dosa kecuali engkau
2497351 apabila aku melarang kamu melaksanakan sesuatu hendaklah kamu jauhi dan apa apabila aku perintahkan kepadamu dengan sesuatu maka lakukanlah menurut kemampuan kamu
2497352 barangsiapa yang mengucapkannya pada siang hari dengan penuh keyakinan dan dia meninggal pada hari itu sebelum waktu sore maka dia termasuk penghuni surga barangsiapa yang mengucapkannya pada malam hari dengan penuh keyakinan dan dia meninggal sebelum waktu pagi maka dia termasuk penghuni surga
2497353 ya allah engkau adalah tuhanku tidak ada tuhan yang wajib disembah kecuali engkau engkau menciptakanku dan aku adalah hamba mu
2497354 sesungguhnya agama tauhid ini adalah agama kamu semua agama yang satu dan aku adalah tuhanmu maka sembahlah aku
2497355 hai manusia sembahlah tuhanmu yang telah menciptakanmu dan orang orang yang sebelummu agar kamu bertakwa dialah yang menjadikan bumi sebagai hamparan bagimu dan langit sebagai atap dan dia menurunkan air hujan dari langit lalu dia menghasilkan dengan hujan itu segala buah buahan sebagai rezki untukmu karena itu janganlah kamu mengadakan sekutu sekutu bagi allah padahal kamu mengetahui

2497365 with the problems weve had it was always going to be a difficult one
2497366 weve had carlos and david all through last season and when you make the changes it upsets the continuity a little bit
2497367 credit to falkirk they played well and missed a penalty allan mcgregor deserved the save he played exceptionally well last season
2497368 i think theyve shown character over the last 18 months although not getting through in the european game kicked our reputation down a notch
2497369 its a wee bit unfair to criticise the players theyve always been excellent while ive been here
2497370 tony is over in spain speaking to the player at the moment but that doesnt mean he will be signing for us
2497371 he is a player with great pedigree and has an outstanding goalscoring record but he isnt the only player we are looking at
2497372 there is a lot going on behind the scenes and i am desperately hoping we can get at least a couple in before the bolton game next week
2497373 we are working tirelessly trying to get players in and there are quite a few irons in the fire at the moment but we will not sign someone for the sake of it
2497374 we have to make sure we get the right players in who have the right quality and the right attitude

2497475 il problema la schizofrenia che stiamo provocando nei nostri elettori da un lato alimentiamo la contrapposizione al berlusconismo dallaltro non facciamo seguire alle nostre parole comportamenti conseguenti s a una manifestazione ma non subito s alle firme ma non per il referendum e invece piazza navona e referendum sul lodo alfano dovevano essere un impegno del partito non essere lasciati in esclusiva a di pietro quando va bene e quando va male al grillismo e allantipolitica con noi organizzatori in piazza non ci sarebbero stati n grillo n guzzanti non si possono eccitare gli animi e poi non incanalare questi sentimenti verso esiti governabili

2497524 we must commit ourselves to the work of imagining our common humanity and of enacting civic rituals that resonate with the music of our ancestors
2497525 there are not two parts of a man there are three body soul and character character is not formed by the mind but primarily by the body
2497526 the first essential characteristic of ancient and of modern olympism is that of being a religion by chiseling his body with exercise as a sculptor chisels a statue the athlete of antiquity was honoring the gods in doing likewise the modern athlete exalts his country his race his flag i therefore think i was right to recreate from the outset around the renewed olympism a religious sentiment transformed and widened by the internationalism and democracy which distinguish the present age but still the same as that which led the young greeks ambitious for the triumph of their muscles to the foot of the altar of zeus
2497527 in 1936 adolph hitler had co opted the games making them a showcase for the nazis hollow facade of a new and better germany
2497528 creating impressions of grandeur and potency was one of hitlers foremost talents the games would launch with lavish and spectacular ceremonies the sacred flame would ignite from the focused rays of the sun in the ruins of ancient olympia then be borne to berlin by a relay of runners by this transfer of fire from the oldest olympic site to the newest the past would touch the present a spirit would move across the ages
2497529 the glorious scheme was set in motion amid the tumbled stones of olympia
2497530 the olympic flame first became a tradition of the modern olympics at the 1928 amsterdam games a torch relay has been held in one form or another at every olympics since the flame is first lighted during a ceremony at the site of the ancient olympic stadium in olympia women dressed in robes similar to those worn by the ancient greeks use a curved mirror to light the torch naturally with the suns rays the high priestess then presents the torch to the first relay runner
2497531 whats needed is something analogous to the ancient acropolis where todays diversity of national and ethnic customs and religious traditions can be celebrated and upheld for the enrichment of everybody the new acropolises will provide opportunity for sacred expression needed to bind the people of the planet into a viable meaningful and sustainable solidarity

2497554 i want to talk to bob warner and i want to find out what assistance he can give us
2497555 right now the group is very small because we wanted to make sure we could get the right people involved if we didn t get the right people involved we d be wasting our time now that we have involvement and support now we can expand that group which we intended to so

2497562 we want to determine what we can do by determining what the problem is then we can determine what steps we can take as a city that make sense and can have an impact to move forward
2497563 we don t know and until we know that you can t commit resources to fight a problem that you haven t even defined
2497564 we need to have some action and we need to have some action quickly
2497565 my goal is to have a list of recommendations submitted to the city council that they can consider and work with local and county officials to try to implement some of the suggestions that we come up with

2497591 the only change in 09 that effects the costing is kers
2497592 i dont mind saying that our budget for kers is 10 per cent of our budget for aerodynamics and composite parts so its not a huge amount of money and we see it as a fantastic investment into the future of the sport
2497593 for us kers is part of the regulations so it is something that we will do
2497594 it is extremely costly and as we are an independent team we dont have the resources to develop like a manufacturer has
2497595 looking at it from a competitive side i dont see it as a potential performance differentiator

2497637 tuhan ciptaan mu yang telah engkau berikan kepadaku membuat hidupku tidak bahagia ia bicara tiada henti sehingga aku tidak dapat beristirahat ia minta selalu untuk diperhatikan ia mudah menangis karena hal hal sepele aku datang untuk mengembalikan wanita itu kepada mu karena aku tidak bisa hidup dengannya
2497638 tuhan sejak aku memberikan kembali wanita ciptaan mu kini aku merana kesepian tiada lagi yang memperhatikanku tiada lagi yang menyayangiku aku selalu memikirkan dia ke mana pun aku pergi aku selalu ingat dia makan tidak enak tidur tidak nyenyak aku rindu kepadanya di kala aku sendirian kubayangkan wajahnya yang cantik kubayangkan bagaimana ia menari dan menyanyi bagaimana ia melirik aku bagaimana ia bercakap cakap dan manja kepadaku ia sangat cantik untuk dipandang dan sedemikian lembut untuk disentuh aku suka akan senyumannya tuhan kembalikan lagi wanita itu kepadaku
2497639 tuhan aku tidak mengerti mengapa dia memberikan lebih banyak lagi kesusahan dari pada kegembiraan dia semakin menyebalkan aku tidak tahan lagi dengan sikap dan tingkah lakunya aku berdoa kepada mu ambillah kembali wanita itu aku tidak dapat lagi hidup dengannya
2497640 apa yang harus aku perbuat aku tidak dapat hidup dengannya tetapi aku juga tidak dapat hidup tanpa dia tuhan ajarilah aku untuk mengerti apa arti hidup ini

2497657 when will we start to realize time is just not on our side
2497658 hey its time to go to the gym then you can come home and finish this up
2497659 if god had told me some time ago that he was about to make me as happy as i could be in this world and then had told me that he should begin by crippling me in all my limbs and removing me from all my usual sources of enjoyment i should have thought it a very strange mode of accomplishing his purpose and yet how is his wisdom manifest even in this for if you should see a man shut up in a closed room idolizing a set of lamps and rejoicing in their light and you wished to make him truly happy you would begin by blowing out all his lamps and then throw open the shutters to let in the light of heaven
2497660 no worries heres a ball worst one in his bag if you can drive the ravine about 150 yrds carry

2497670 i will kevin all the credit but i am so frustrated we were very well organised and they did not give us too many problems

2497672 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2497673 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2497674 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2497675 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2497676 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2497677 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2497678 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2497679 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2497680 if i ever get in the backfield thats because they took on a double team

2497707 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2497708 that is why i want both public and private sector to be involved in financing activities he said

2497715 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2497716 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2497717 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2497718 to find out full details and are ready to provide whatever assistance we can
2497719 he was not only my father but also my best friend and yes the single most important man in my life we had great bonding my father has always been my mentor and role model
2497720 i remember when i was five years old i had wanted so much to buy potato chips in the store of our village but i had already spent my entire allowance for the week so i gathered my mothers black garden stones and painted colorful art work subjects on them i put a table in front of our main gate and sold the stones at p1 each to the helpers and drivers of my neighbors
2497721 obviously they were just forced to buy these stones out of pity or simply because i was so makulit well i raked it in not only did i earn extra money i learned the value of money and hard work as well
2497722 being the youngest of five daughters i came 10 years after the fourth sibling i had the power and influence as the baby of the family and perceived to be daddys girl to get what i wanted without having to work for it
2497723 but at a very young age i was not allowed to get away with murder because discipline was instilled by my parents my sisters and i had to study or work hard and deserve what we wanted to have
2497724 i wanted to experience going through a job interview getting hired and being employed by someone other than my father
2497725 and my first job taught me the virtue of humility i learned how to be a subordinate to take commands from superiors to relate with my coworkers and to perform tasks that i would probably not have done if i had worked in the family corporation
2497726 it was a rewarding experience and a gratifying exposure to the outside world it was a very liberating feeling to step out of my comfort zone it was a stepping stone to becoming truly independent
2497727 those who know me very well will tell you that perhaps most of my mothers german qualities have rubbed off on me
2497728 the german army in parade formation would pale in comparison to the way my shirts are folded or shoes are lined up and even before mmda chair bayani fernando thought of the color coding scheme my clothes were already color coded all whites go together all blues and so on and so forth
2497729 being a public servant fulfilled my dream of serving the country in my own little way
2497730 to date the department of education has generated close to p400 million in donations from adopting entities and through this law hundreds of thousands of students have been put to school and hundreds of schools have additional classroom laboratories and libraries this is the greatest success of my life because it is the filipino people who are benefiting from this undertaking
2497731 when i turned 18 my mother brought me to the us embassy to process my papers for my oath of citizenship at that time my three older siblings were already residing in the united states
2497732 the car ride from makati to the us embassy was so long and tiring because i argued nonstop with my mom
2497733 i was born a filipino i will die a filipino i will make something of myself here in the philippines i promise you mommy
2497734 i named it kessel after my mom who was a patron of the performing arts i am fulfilling another dream and i have never been more excited
2497735 i still have so many dreams to fulfill for myself and others my sincere desire and passion is to be where i can serve
2497736 this is what i continue to aspire for to be able to make a tremendous difference not only in the lives of people i encounter but also to the growth of our country
2497737 i am proud to be a filipino i am a filipino

2497742 we would gladly accept anything that would remind people about the artists or the institutions legacy
2497743 the hotel will provide each guest a feeling of nostalgia and will relive manilas glorious artistic and cultural past while enjoying a timeless enclave of luxury and class
2497744 lets face it our location is not really an ideal place for a luxury hotel since it can be quite noisy even chaotic several motels and clubs offering nude shows abound in the area and for the past several decades the place was a blight in the landscape people tried to avoid it because it had gained notoriety for various crime incidents
2497745 but we intend to use whatever we have around to our advantage like the light rail transit which will be connected to one of our entrances giving our guests easy access to any place they wish to go to
2497746 were also working hand in hand with the city government on the street lighting program as well as with people in the nearby community including out of school youth and street children who we intend to train as hotel workers

2498067 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2498068 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation

2498072 fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2498073 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2498074 i disagree i think it is the failure to be more positive about future georgian nato membership that has effectively given a green light for the russian attack

2498077 but they are terrible for farmers the already thin mountain soils have lost virtually all their productive nutrients
2498078 but where you can construe the law in the favor of property owners well construe it that way
2498079 this is a story that needs to be told not for my benefit but for the taxpayers and the public
2498080 i told them they need to change that because there is no way in this world that they are serving the public
2498081 is why didnt the county have to hire him to prove it was a wetland instead of me having to hire him to prove its not
2498082 i think the letter made him feel like a big lawbreaker and that certainly wasnt the intent
2498083 thats another lesson learned how we go about engaging someone with a potential violation
2498084 i lost the production of that land for a year already
2498085 we all should fall upon our knees and sing out praise for manganese
2498086 theoretically if sodium is not a factor even if large quantities of calcium or magnesium carbonate are applied the soil ph will not exceed 8 2 to 8 3 at ph 8 2 the soil carbonate reaches an equilibrium with the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere
2498087 and theres no easy way for farmers to apply it with existing equipment they also need to know there is a large enough source of the material farmers are driven by profit as is everyone and they need to be shown that it will improve their bottom line
2498088 no one is sure what types of biomass should be used as raw material
2498089 or exactly what production methods work best so calculating the costs is really an exercise in speculation
2498090 the secret of the terra preta is not only applying charcoal and chicken manure there must be something else
2498091 if you use terra preta you have sustaining yields more or less constantly year after year
2498092 you would need 50 or 100 years to get a similar combination between the stable charcoal and the ingredients
2498093 i think research into the biological behavior of terra preta is where the new frontier will be
2498094 lots of old people perhaps not a sign of vigorousness
2498095 just by changing the management from focusing on dry matter poundage to managing those soil organisms you can increase the productivity of your land
2498096 rotation range management of this type was used as far back as the 1870s in germany but united states scientists didnt start studying the potential benefits of it until 1982
2498097 300 times more potent than co2 so even small emissions of this non co2 gas can make a considerable contribution to global warming
2498098 when nitrogen is added to a wheat field as fertilizer or added to a pasture through animal faeces or clover swards a part of the nitrogen can be lost as nitrous oxide and when the weather conditions are right this can lead to large emissions of nitrous oxide
2498099 at a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers some are quietly converting those pension plans into resources to finance their executives retirement benefits and pay in recent years companies from intel corporation to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation
2498100 like the sinking of the titanic catastrophes are not democratic

2498111 he said its got to be a mistake it has to be we are going to schedule another test there is no way its just gone and just the whole time he is stuttering and there is just this look on his face like i dont understand i dont know we did another one and it was gone and his words were it was truly a miracle this has to be the act of god
2498112 we both hit our knees and we were praying that was actually on a wednesday so when we got to church we had a good 30 people or more lay hands on her and it just you could feel god i cant say we prayed as much before i mean we did but not like this not like we do now
2498113 he said its got to be a mistake it has to be we are going to schedule another test there is no way its just gone and just the whole time he is stuttering and there is just this look on his face like i dont understand i dont know we did another one and it was gone and his words were it was truly a miracle this has to be the act of god
2498114 i have never been as comfortable in my faith as i am right now the best way to describe it i was a mediocre christian to be honest i mean i went to church the mundane thing you do this and you do that and you think okay im going to heaven looking back now i dont know that i would have i know i will now i know this has opened my eyes and i think maybe god used that to make us better believers to make us fully depend on him
2498115 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2498116 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2498117 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2498118 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2498119 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2498120 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2498121 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2498122 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2498282 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2498283 i can tell you that we are working with the family and the chinese authorities as we speak
2498284 no country is a 100 safe these things can happen anywhere
2498285 i think that this is an isolated incident and has nothing to do with the olympics
2498286 a night in beijing is far safer than daylight in most american cities
2498287 beijing has been so friendly and welcoming that this is just bizarre i still think its a safe city but i guess ill be a bit more aware now
2498288 you go to most venues and you usually find something wrong
2498289 but there is nothing wrong here it makes you want to race it is very very exciting
2498290 these are the best facilities ive competed in and the nicest dorms definitely
2498291 the athletes village is cool theres like grass and sculptures everywhere its a really nice environment
2498292 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that citizens must not harm national social and collective interests
2498293 im an honoured guest of the ioc were working for the ioc and one of companies does the pr for the beijing olympic organising committee weve worked with the ioc for many years its good fun its not exactly a hardship being here but im here to see clients rather than to see the olympics
2498294 it was a privilege to be at the opening ceremony creatively it was very good technologically it was very good and it was extremely good natured the scale of it all is what really impresses you it is the coming out party for china and the ceremony fulfilled the expectations of the chinese hosting the olympics is a clear signal of chinese strength power resource and influence
2498295 i think after the games economic growth will slow a bit thats my sense it cant continue at this sort of growth rate but from our point of view that will be good because we rather hope that our competition will pack up and go home and leave the field open to us
2498296 i love chinese food especially sichuan i like hot and spicy
2498297 were on a ten day trip organised by the school i love sport so i wanted to come to see some of the olympics weve got tickets for the tennis water polo and basketball
2498298 i think its going to be seeing the sport but its good to experience a bit of chinese culture too were going to the great wall next week
2498299 the chinese can be a bit intrusive especially when they want to sell you something
2498300 its really hot and muggy and its a bit polluted too
2498301 we had a good meal last night i think the chinese food here is better than back at home
2498302 weve been to every olympics since barcelona in 1992 were big sports fans so thats why were here we got our tickets back in the uk theyre the cheapest tickets of any olympics weve been to so far
2498303 its going to be watching the games weve got tickets for all the athletics events but i also want to get out and about to see how life is for people in beijing
2498304 not being able to get tickets to the cycling events because there are so many brits in with a chance of winning medals
2498305 im surprised by how humid it is and that its quite cloudy i was expecting blue skies after hearing about all the work theyd done to fix the weather
2498306 its been good so far we ate in a local restaurant last night and it was fine
2498307 i came from australia and new zealand and got to china two weeks ago i started in hong kong then went to shanghai and xian and now im here for a week before i go home
2498308 i didnt come specifically for the olympics but now im here i think its going to be good just walking around you can feel the atmosphere is really electric im looking forward to having some big nights out and im hoping to get tickets for a few events if i can
2498309 none in beijing so far but my hotel in hong kong was really bad it upsets me just thinking about it
2498310 i did expect blue skies but its been grey since i got here
2498311 its strange that im 12 and the people i will be diving against are up to the age of 18 its quite scary
2498312 it could all go wrong and i could get injured
2498313 we can only control what happens in our system tom daley has coaches nutritionists and sports scientists who understand what it takes to protect and properly develop young athletes theres also a huge responsibility to ensure a balanced life and interaction with children his own age
2498314 the chinese love him they cheer for him almost as much as they do for their own divers they call him baby
2498315 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2498316 i can tell you that we are working with the family and the chinese authorities as we speak

2498327 if god had told me some time ago that he was about to make me as happy as i could be in this world and then had told me that he should begin by crippling me in all my limbs and removing me from all my usual sources of enjoyment i should have thought it a very strange mode of accomplishing his purpose and yet how is his wisdom manifest even in this for if you should see a man shut up in a closed room idolizing a set of lamps and rejoicing in their light and you wished to make him truly happy you would begin by blowing out all his lamps and then throw open the shutters to let in the light of heaven
2498328 whatever you can get in between now and whenever i happen to land at my computer on saturday morning ill accept

2498352 think of it all that speech pouring down selling nothing judging nobody drenching the thick mulch of dead leaves soaking the trees filling the gullies and crannies of the wood with water what a thing to sit absolutely alone in the forest at night cherished by this wonderful unintelligible perfectly innocent speech the talk that rain makes by itself all over the ridges and the talk of the watercourses everywhere in the hollows nobody started it nobody is going to stop it it will talk as long as it wants this rain as long as it talks i am going to listen
2498353 three quarters full and counting http library cern ch heplw 12 papers 2
2498354 we know very little about the toxicity of these chemicals
2498355 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2498356 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2498357 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games

2498362 theyre sitting on their hands unable to do their jobs or theyre going out on suppression assignments doing what they know to be the wrong thing
2498363 its driving our fire chiefs nutty out on the forests
2498364 speaking of cool its time for yet another review on the long long line of heatsink fan combos that are gracing the store shelves these days todays victim er subject is the rosewill rcx z4 now i know what youre all thinking who the hell is rosewill and why should we care the answer to both of those questions is this i dont know before i received my latest shipment of reviewees i had never heard of rosewill all i know is that they make one strange looking heatsink that in my opinion doesnt look like it would do much at all
2498365 unfortunately i think its going to be pushed off till early 2009
2498366 but the next two quarters are probably going to be weak

2498371 wir haben uns das leben in der ersten halbzeit schwer gemacht nach dem wechsel waren wir viel effektiver
2498372 die haben ganz sch n dampf gemacht es war ein super schweres spiel ich freue mich dass ich wieder die null gehalten habe das ist wichtig in dieser starken gruppe
2498373 wir m ssen schauen dass wir uns im spiel nach vorn verbessern da muss mehr pr zision rein
2498374 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2498375 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2498376 we believe that itll present a very compelling alternative and bring openness to the world of small business which has not historically been true
2498377 the client side of the it environment is one the last bastions of proprietary technology it has been disproportionately dominated by one vendor
2498378 i can hardly name an area where we need more choice
2498379 the pure plays were the first people to figure out the internet
2498380 it took the multichannel guys a while but now their growth seems to be accelerating
2498381 it might turn out that this is the defining moment for online advertising retailers never really considered it as deeply and seriously as they are doing now
2498382 growth is coming in part from people looking to sell things to make ends meet
2498383 without human skin like sensitivity robots cannot be used in everyday life imagine the danger if a robot did not recognise when it had accidentally bumped into a young child
2498384 in any area where you need electronics that can stretch and bend without compromising performance for example in wearable electronics to monitor movement this is going to be quite a breakthrough
2498385 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
2498386 you dont want to give up on people like that just because they have had a few injuries
2498387 when he is fit louis is an explosive player who will guarantee 20 goals a season louis is on a programme at the moment which we feel will get him to 100 fitness it is more about his confidence in doing this programme which will get him back playing all the time hopefully that is the case because he is such a fantastic player
2498388 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2498389 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2498390 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2498391 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2498392 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2498393 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2498394 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2498395 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2498396 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2498397 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2498398 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2498399 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2498400 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2498401 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2498402 this is heresy but one day google will die what happens to data when a company dies is a big question
2498403 we are looking at three or four different options in the striking department which i hope will come to a happy conclusion
2498404 hopefully we will have someone in for the start of the season
2498405 of course everybody wants to play at the highest level i want to play also at the highest level but at this time i am in ajax so i will see what is happening
2498406 we really dont want him to leave and we are going to do everything we can to make sure he doesnt
2498407 i love clubs with great history like ajax i also love united
2498408 its a club that makes me dream especially as ruud van nistelrooy played there and did great things with them i know certain english clubs are following me like manchester united who are very interested in me
2498409 when you look at the ajax salary structure he could get a huge deal
2498410 but he doesnt want to see a release clause set at 25million euros 19 75million in his contract we didnt want to go any lower
2498411 there has been no movement on that front all i know is what i read in the papers we will have to wait and see what happens it is a question of waiting a bit more and then we will see how things turn out
2498412 todays public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players
2498413 this comes after a series of events dating back to last summer which have shown manchester united to be in breach of premier league pl rules as a result we have today made an official complaint to the pl about the conduct of manchester united
2498414 we will see what happens there but we are talking about two very important players
2498415 for the moment they are with us but whatever happens the idea is to have a great squad with the potential to allow us to aim to improve on what we managed last season we have to be realistic and see what we are starting with and who we are competing against there are some big clubs who have spent a lot of money over many years and have a certain advantage in fact they claim they want to sign some of our players at tottenham we have had a clear philosophy regarding buying and selling for years the idea is signing young players promising and talented ones and if important offers for older players are made studying it to see what is the best for the club
2498416 i know for certain manchester united have shown interest in signing dimitar berbatov
2498417 we know the situation of berbatov and we are calm about it
2498418 if a team comes along and pays the asking price the chairman wants then possibly yes but were delighted to have him here
2498419 we are trying to understand what the new manager wants and is trying to bring to the team
2498420 it will be an interesting season after the moves going on here we need to prove we can continue without some players who were key last season
2498421 a lot of people said my transfer to a bigger club was about to happen but i live in the present and im focused on blackburn
2498422 if he fergie comes on asking about santa cruz then ill just tell him hes not having him
2498423 the interest from manchester united is real but im busy now so my representatives will handle anything if there is a concrete offer
2498424 with 40m 31 7m or 50m 39 7m we would sell benzemas ear
2498425 it is not a question of money the player wants to achieve something big in the champions league with lyon he is happy at the club and this can be seen with his latest contract renewal i am sure that he will stay with lyon until the 2010 world cup finals
2498426 i know that there are a lot of interested clubs but he is still young and wants to stay and gain more experience next season he will continue to play for lyon and then we shall see
2498427 in recent months my name has been linked to barcelona real madrid juventus and now manchester united have appeared
2498428 that is high praise and im sure id be able to play in england but i believe my style is perhaps better suited for spain or italy
2498429 that was a great goal nothing you can do about it
2498430 also because ronaldo is there hes my idol hes from another planet but i also love juventus inter and manchester united the big clubs whats important is to win i would leave lyon only to continue to win and when i also feel ready mentally
2498431 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
2498432 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
2498433 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine
2498434 the gospel portrait implies that jesus would be found guilty by the self conscious religious majority of any age and background
2498435 stop supporting the zionists as their regime reached its final stage
2498436 accept that the life of zionists will sooner or later come to an end
2498437 yahoo understands the trust of our users is our greatest asset so we strive to create the most trusted compelling online experience
2498438 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2498439 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice
2498440 projections for growth of our paid subscriber base were low compared to the growth of online advertising

2498445 the words lynch and racism have never come up until this moron wrote this blog
2498446 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody should have told him
2498447 politics and poetics are united this is a dream not of a common language but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia
2498448 can we hold onto the possibility of a self consciousness that does not simply because it must be critical of oppressive forces repeatedly fold in upon itself becoming self referential and self incarcerating in the form of that non communicative language that foucault mis recognizes as literature as such
2498449 the age of the world target self referentiality in war theory and comparative work
2498450 the unpacking of the semiotic density of discourse including political discourse performs an anthropological function in politically dangerous environments in the sense that pure value is accorded positions that let the theorist evade statements of clear opposition to the status quo and allow him or her to defer instead to the values of ambivalence and indeterminacy to penetrate the meaning of contemporary politics we think demands a different and difficult intellectual leap in which one is required to work ones way through and out of this subjectively experienced complexity and grasp the bald objectivity staring us in the face
2498451 art as a separate sphere was always possible only in a bourgeois society even as a negation of that social purposiveness which is spreading through the market its freedom remains essentially bound up with the premise of a commodity economy
2498452 poetry as a creative practice can aim at an actual rather than formal freedom through a language that challenges and negotiates a neoliberal structure of feelings
2498453 the inability to find an optimism of the intellect with which to work through alternatives has now become one of the most serious barriers to progressive politics
2498454 thus there is an ambiguity of agency at the site of this decision one decides on the condition of an already decided field of language but this repetition does not constitute the decision of the speaking subject as a redundancy the gap between redundancy and repetition is the space of agency

2498459 all attempts to contact her have failed it is feared that zeng has been taken into police custody and might be mistreated
2498460 as the olympics open in beijing it is believed that zeng was taken away to ensure that no journalists will have access to her and that she will be unable to speak out about hu jia during the games
2498461 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people

2498467 sandeep never mentioned about work pressure the option of transfer to some other project available to any executive in the company was open to him
2498468 our work culture which revolves around good work life balance is our unique selling point usp
2498469 this helps the organisation to know about the negative aspects of its working apart from sorting out the aggrieved employees problem
2498470 there was a lot of pressure on everyone players coaches and supporters it was a relief more than anything
2498471 his wife lost a baby because of a car accident earlier in the year and that had a very adverse mental effect on him
2498472 he was struggling outside of footy and that day he just couldnt take it any more he shouldnt have done what he did but he was certainly provoked
2498473 there were a few of us pretty amazed there was the possibility he could be deregistered
2498474 i honestly never knew anything about that rule and ive been involved in the vcfl administration for a very long time it sort of hit me out of the blue
2498475 hes seen professional people to help whatever the problem was
2498476 he needed to do that to show hes getting back on track
2498477 his problem was he couldnt keep his gob shut its nowhere near as bad as a bloke whos got white line fever and goes around king hitting blokes behind play hes not that kind of bloke
2498478 that arrogance he displayed in the forward line kicking heaps of goals was hard to replace
2498479 but he was plan b when he came on board we just started kicking long to aaron so weve reverted back to plan a which was running the ball hard through the middle streaming into the forward line
2498480 in the end i was pleased with my score because it was so difficult out there
2498481 it was nice to get ahead of the game early i had a couple of chances on the back nine which would have been nice to convert on holes 11 and 13 but it was hard
2498482 i didnt drive it too badly on the back nine i didnt drive it as well on the front nine if i can hit a couple more fairways i think im fairly good
2498483 he did run third to weekend hussler at 1200 in the group 1 newmarket handicap
2498484 we prepared him for it we gave him a barrier trial i was a little worried about the 1200 first up but he fought it out good
2498485 he likes having his races spaced so hell go home and have a nice easy time on the farm then well bring him back
2498486 hes fitter than he was at the same stage last year and a run like that augurs well for when he gets down in the weights in the better mile handicaps
2498487 i know theres still a lot of improvement left in the horse im not the sort of trainer to have him tuned right up first up
2498488 he went as good as he could have gone on the day
2498489 he got on the back of a weakening playwright which probably cost him fourth spot
2498490 hes a real giant just coming into his frame mentally hes really on song thats what im so excited about

2498497 we see this visit as unfortunate especially in the sensitive and crucial time in which iran is not giving a direct reply to the west about its nuclear programme
2498498 the iranian president keeps calling for the destruction of the israeli state and denies the holocaust so this visit is unfortunate because it gives legitimacy to iran
2498499 retail sales while positive during the quarter were impacted by the unseasonable spring weather and continuing economic headwinds
2498500 earnings are expected to improve in the second half of the year as investments in the credit card relaunch and various productivity initiatives begin to positively impact results
2498501 that was the weirdest game i think ive ever seen but in the end we didnt play well enough to win
2498502 we cant be mad thinking we had a chance to win with that number of turnovers im surprised it was even that close
2498503 i guess youd have to say the special teams certainly kept us in there in the first half because we certainly didnt start very fast
2498504 were trying to keep the lines of communications open if they want to come back to the table we will make ourselves available
2498505 theres been no contact from the company and i dont expect there will be
2498506 weve been very clear from the start that weve made our best offer we certainly hope it is not going to be a long strike but the duration of this work stoppage is really up to the union
2498507 it would be better for everyone if it was over sooner rather than later but at the same time the resolve of our members is quite strong
2498508 productivity should continue strong as companies slash costs to deal with the current environment
2498509 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive

2498511 sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
2498512 this was a quarter of strong progress against our strategic imperatives especially the significant acceleration of our wireless business

2498527 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep

2498533 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight

2498539 in every place there are troublemakers some stay like that and others change

2498543 i didnt get a creepy feeling i just thought that he was a spoiled brat
2498544 that we were peasants and his father had told him not to talk to peasants
2498545 he had a kind of a rich person kind of distance thing going on
2498546 he can be funny at times witty laughs at your jokes he walked into the yacht club pretending like he owned the place

2498549 he was a sales manager and never made a sale so eventually he was fired
2498550 if anybody touches my stuff ill bring my german luger
2498551 it started to become very apparent that whatever he said was a story it was made up
2498552 at most places but especially wall street your word is your bond and whenever you get someone like this youre sitting on a liability and so it was that more than anything that prompted the firm to decide that wed be better of without him

2498717 this is a lot of money for a property that the district could have purchased years ago and the run up in price is based on the developer speculating that if the district didnt buy it he could put a huge development on it and make double his investment

2498795 calhouns political theory should be understood as a reflective journey
2498796 towards recovering genuine popular rule amidst the national crises that occurred during his career as a statesmen and political philosopher
2498797 a strong tendency to disorder and abuse of its power as all experiences and almost every page of history will testify
2498798 calhoun confronted a political situation in which the twin attributes of expansion and independence from group interests had failed in practice
2498799 if extending the regime had proved fruitless at reducing conflict and preventing the coalescing of forces calhoun envisioned the solution for america as a return to the original instrumentation of diffused authority
2498800 instead of yearning to dicatate all decision making by controlling government
2498801 the concurrent majority recognizes and incorporates the natural divisions of authority into a coherent whole through a mode of deliberation premised upon compromise with the numerical majority and more absolutist forms governing the only path to power is found in the domination of the government t he concurrent majority relies upon compromise among the constitutive parts of the republic to ameliorate tension and promote cooperation
2498802 return to the original diffusion of political authority and authentic popular rule
2498803 to talk of liberty without a constitution or which is the same thing an organic or fundamental system of legislation by which the will of the government may be effectually coerced or restrained is to utter ideas without meaning and to suppose an ultimate power on the part of government to interpret the constitution as it pleases and to resort to force to execute its interpretation against the authority which created the constitution itself is to be guilty of the greatest political absurdity that can be imagined
2498804 i n governments of the concurrent majority mere numbers have not the absolute control and the wealthy and intelligent being identified in interest with the poor and ignorant of their respective portions or interests of the community become their leaders and protectors and hence as the latter would have neither hope nor inducement to rally the former in order to obtain the control the right of suffrage under such a government may be safely enlarged to the extent stated without incurring the hazard to which enlargement would expose governments of the numerical majority
2498805 but as there can be no constitution without the negative power and no negative power without the concurrent majority it follows necessarily that where the numerical majority has the sole control of the government there can be no constitution as constitution implies limitation or restriction and of course is inconsistent with the idea of sole or exclusive power and hence the numerical unmixed with the concurrent majority necessarily forms in all cases absolute government
2498806 on the contrary the government of the concurrent majority where the organism is perfect excludes the possibility of oppression by giving to each interest or portion or order where there are established classes the means of protecting itself by its negative against all measures calculated to advance the peculiar interests of others at its expense its effect then is to cause the different interests portions or orders as the case lay be to desist from attempting to adopt any measure calculated to promote the prosperity of one or more by sacrificing that of others and thus to force them to unite in such measures only as would promote the prosperity of all as the only means to prevent the suspension of the action of the government and thereby to avoid anarchy the greatest of all evils it is by means of such authorized and effectual resistance that oppression is prevented and the necessity of resorting to force superseded in governments of the concurrent majority and hence compromise instead of force becomes their conservative principle
2498807 the concurrent majority on the other hand tends to unite the most opposite and conflicting interests and to blend the whole in one common attachment to the country by giving to each interest or portion the power of self protection all strife and struggle between them for ascendency is prevented and thereby not only every feeling calculated to weaken the attachment to the whole is suppressed but the individual and the social feelings are made to unite in one common devotion to country each sees and feels that it can best promote its own prosperity by conciliating the goodwill and promoting the prosperity of the others and hence there will be diffused throughout the whole community kind feelings between its different portions and instead of antipathy a rivalry amongst them to promote the interests of each other under the combined influence of these causes the interests of each would be merged in the common interests of the whole and thus the community would become a unit by becoming the common centre of attachment of all its parts and hence instead of faction strife and struggle for party ascendency there would be patriotism nationality harmony and a struggle only for supremacy in promoting the common good of the whole
2498808 we are not final because we are infallible but we are infallible only because we are final
2498809 unlawful government presents historical and legal evidence to argue that the federal government has utterly cast off its constitutional limitations thereby transforming america from a voluntary civil society into a compulsory political one such massive concentration of political power in one entitys hands contradicts both the law and the modern world whose hallmarks are decentralization competition and individual freedom
2498810 b efore the civil war the nature of american federalism was still a subject of debate the outcome of the civil war ended that debate the nationalists emerged as victors national power increased as the twentieth century approached along with the corresponding disappearance of states rights
2498811 while the civil war may have altered the federal state relationship it did not justify social revolution beyond the terms of peace or actual constitutional amendment for instance the civil war did not change natural law common american republican heritage including the right to revolution founders intent nor most of the original compact
2498812 the natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground
2498813 the independent judiciary insulated from the ever changing winds of politics is vital to any society governed by the rule of law the adjudication of cases and controversies in which the rights of citizens are at stake must remain beyond the sphere of politics for if lady justice were to lose her blindfold then the scales would forever tip in favor of the powerful article iii of the constitution created such an independent judiciary in the supreme court and in such lower federal courts as congress may wish to establish whose judges received lifetime appointments and whose compensation can never decrease during their tenure
2498814 the courts must declare the sense of the law and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgement the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body
2498815 the more corrupt the nation the more numerous the laws
2498816 nos quedan muchos a os todav a viendo llegar cayucos

2498818 ok so i admit im no trained professional business man i didnt get a fancy degree at any respectable college hell i didnt even take the time to mail away for a fake degree to impress women at bars im a lazy smug and frankly cruel person however i do have a brilliant idea on how to spice up the offices of franksen franksen franksen and blarnett the lawyers office where i work pant less fridays every business manager seems to love the idea of letting their employees wear a hawaiian shirt or jeans on friday and i think that we need to take this to the next level i mean after all who are we we are a bunch of smug lawyers taking on big cases and pushing paper around so lets make some fun out of it
2498819 its a sort of way to catch up on all the weeks harrassments from the lawyers
2498820 i just dont have the time to go running around filling sexual harassment papers all day this way i can save it all up and submit them in batches

2498822 i love my pant less moments to those days when im in mexico lobbying for looser cocaine import tax but that doesnt mean im going to parade around in my leederhosen with a smile on my face around the office
2498823 how the hell am i supposed to get any work done when i cant feel my upper thighs
2498824 i enjoy being without pants but just not in a professional setting im very self conscious about everything north of my knees and south of my belly button

2498846 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2498847 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2498848 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2498849 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2498850 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2498851 lord you know ive been so many places at least i know i have a longer view

2498902 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
2498903 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
2498904 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
2498905 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
2498906 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
2498907 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
2498908 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
2498909 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
2498910 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

2498931 second given that voters will soon be electing a new mayor and a new city council it is the height of arrogance not to mention a big waste of time and money for a lame duck city hall and or lame duck city council to be involved in the proposal process from developers and or campaign contributors referenced in todays richmond times dispatch
2498932 after failing to do anything for almost 4 years and driving the braves out of richmond it would be the height of arrogance for a lame duck city hall and a lame duck city council to handcuff the people of richmond to another of their failed visions or schemes
2498933 in a very short time we will have a new mayor and a new city council
2498934 what city hall and city council need to do is to concentrate on closing what the mayor says is a 6 million dollar hole i believe city hall and city council have actually created a far bigger fiscal mess in the city budget not on some last minute attempts by lame duck officials to impose another of their failed visions or schemes on the people of richmond
2498935 first i reject any plan to bulldoze the diamond and eliminate any baseball stadium from the current area indeed that would be tantamount to the wilder administration having driven baseball out of richmond as there is no other viable location for a triple aaa or double aa stadium in the city
2498936 second given that voters will soon be electing a new mayor and a new city council it is the height of arrogance not to mention a big waste of time and money for a lame duck city hall and or lame duck city council to be involved in the proposal process from developers and or campaign contributors referenced in todays richmond times dispatch

2498960 did you know that robert crumb has moved to switzerland and he and his wife alice are still together
2498961 the document is a challenge to various sharia councils who dont believe in gender equality but the world has changed and islamic law has to be renegotiated
2498962 this document has been carefully researched over a four year period and i feel confident in recommending its findings to women and men of the muslim faith contemplating marriage
2498963 brings muslim marriages in britain into line with positive developments in muslim family law across the muslim world
2498964 a lot of people come to us and the islamic shari ah council for advice and we realised that islamic marriage had lots of problems
2498965 many muslims in this country have a village background with muslims from sylhet in bangladesh or in pakistan where the local imam performs a nikah without proper registration or properly recording that such a ceremony has taken place
2498966 but in britain more marriages are breaking down and young people have said that we need to update things
2498967 contrary to what militant secularists say it is actually possible to modify ancient religious rulings to adapt to a modern setting
2498968 and woman shall have rights similar to rights them according to what is equitable but men have a degree of advantage over them
2498969 this contract is revolutionary and will lead the way in addressing problems that exist under sharia law although it is only the tip of the iceberg it is a revolutionary step nothing like this has happened in 100 years the adoption of this model will change everything and force people to talk about the issues
2498970 we need to separate islamic principles from their cultures of origin and anchor them in the cultural reality of western europe
2498971 i can incorporate everything thats not opposed to my religion into my identity
2498972 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2498973 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2498974 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2498975 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2498976 shes gonna bring us back and not deal with it the american people are gonna hang her

2498978 jai tellement dhistoires outrageantes trop et je vais toutes les dire
2498979 so im searching for it just go back at it tomorrow see what we can do trust me i want it a lot more than you do
2498980 hopefully in hindsight ill look back at this and say wow that was a stretch of 20 games
2498981 the numbers are almost irrelevant if i feel good at the plate im going to get hits but when you dont feel like theres a consistency i feel like im battling that and thats hard
2498982 they can put the ball on a tee for you if you dont feel good consistent theres no guarantee youre going to get hits but youre not going to cry
2498983 it was a reminder of how bad they kicked our rear last year and that we needed to have good solid games against that team
2498984 we were up against a guy like jon lester who has tremendous movement on his pitches and mark buehrle was able to match him and give us a solid outing against a really tough lineup
2498985 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
2498986 you got into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them
2498987 and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
2498988 sometimes its easier to hold onto your own stereotypes and misconceptions it makes you feel justified in your ignorance thats america
2498989 let me tell you something for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is making a comeback
2498990 we have become a nation of struggling folks who are barely making it every day
2498991 folks are just jammed up and its gotten worse over my lifetime and doggone it im young forty four
2498992 god damn america for treating our citizens as less than human god damn america for as long as she acts like she is god and she is supreme
2498993 we bombed hiroshima we bombed nagasaki and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and the pentagon and we never batted an eye
2498994 we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards americas chickens are coming home to roost
2498995 our friend was strong and gentle once he called america hopeful big hearted idealistic daring decent and fair that was america and yes our friend and next ronald reagan was beloved because of what he believed he believed in america so he made it his shining city on a hill he believed in freedom so he acted on behalf of its values and ideals he believed in tomorrow so the great communicator became the great liberator
2498996 he came to office with great hopes for america and more than hopes ronald reagan matched an optimistic temperament with bold persistent action
2498997 willya do that i hope you enjoy your stay in new york its a grand place
2498998 shes all right youd like her the only trouble is shes a little too affectionate sometimes
2498999 well i hate it boy do i hate it i said but it isnt just that its everything i hate living in new york and all taxicabs and madison avenue buses with the drivers and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door and being introduced to phony guys that call the lunts angels and going up and down elevators when you just want to go outside and guys fitting your pants all the time at the brooks and people always
2499000 if i didnt have this school then that is really it for me

2499002 maybe she goes to a new boarding school or maybe ill send her to bangladesh i dont know
2499003 if worse comes to worse ill have to send my daughter home to pakistan which i dont want to
2499004 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2499005 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2499006 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
2499007 sites that you need to have for your job its important that you raise them for bocogs awareness

2499025 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2499026 the united states is working actively with its european partners to launch international mediation we urgently seek russias support of these efforts
2499027 that is the absolutely essential bargain that must be struck to be able to move a peace process forward
2499028 their cultural rights need to be preserved and of course they need to retain some kind of disproportionate political role in abkhazia just as weve negotiated in bosnia for minorities there
2499029 the increase of russian pressure against georgia comes in the context of georgias trans atlantic aspirations particularly its attempts to secure a membership action plan map from nato
2499030 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2499031 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2499032 the first thing needed is to make the georgians return to their positions and re establish the status quo we had before
2499033 i may look comfortable but there is no way i was completely in control of that race my goal for these olympics is that they will run smoothly and i will get a good result
2499034 the race turned out to be good at the end it was harder than i expected i was ready to compete but this is the first race in a long time the conditions are fine theres a slight breeze but it didnt bother me my mum dad and brother are here its the first time my brother has seen me compete the olympic regatta feels different and it was good to hear cheering in the last 500m i dont really feel under pressure because i am the youngest in this event its kind of nice to be the underdog
2499035 it was not so easy doing a race again after such a long break ive had trouble getting used to the heat but its better than when i arrived on 27th july i trained in germany but had no special preparation for the climate its interesting to be in the olympic village theres a good atmosphere and lots of people around my husband is having fun talking to people about different lifestyles and exchanging pins
2499036 i struggled a little its very hot at the opening ceremony the atmosphere was great especially the echo as we came through the tunnel and the noise as we entered the stadium i expected it to be a late night and have no regrets about being there
2499037 my preparation went very well and for once without pain or struggle my main goal is to get to the finish and my main opposition is karsten i met steve redgrave in 2002 and he has been my mentor since then he helps everyone and is good at mental training
2499038 it was hard in the beginning because marcel hacker ger is quick off the start i had a big push in the middle and he dropped out then i controlled it totally but you get really tired anyway my aim is to reach the final and i hope to be in the top three i watched the opening ceremony on tv it was fantastic but i couldnt stay up for every country
2499039 this is my first race since lucerne and i raced quite conservatively for me because i normally blast off the start i was well prepared and had a surge of pace in the last 200m which felt good i have no injury problems apart from the usual leg pains etc my priority is to recover and get ready for the quarter final im going to take each day as it comes like stepping stones and plan to put in more and more along the way and get faster and faster hopefully therell be no hiccups fingers crossed legs crossed toes crossed everything crossed
2499040 the race was wonderful and it was very unexpected to win because we have not been performing well this season its nice to be in a warm place because in our country we are not spoiled by the weather we had a break from competing between 2004 and 2007 but weve kept training last year our coach decided to put us together again and it seems to be working very well our goal is to confirm our performance of last year when we won the world championships in munich
2499041 this was an impressive race it followed our normal tactic to start slowly pass everyone and go faster and faster we passed the germans at 1000m and just kept going away i already have four olympic medals two from sydney and two from athens im hoping to win two here again since im also in the womens eight everything here and in the olympic village is great and the chinese people are very helpful
2499042 for me this was very hard this hot weather this season i rowed my first world cup series and this is my first olympics although we are so young we try to ignore the pressure but we feel it were happy to have come third and qualify directly to the semi final and hopefully well do better in our next race the olympic village is incredible ive seen nothing like this before the experience is unbelievable my family is not here but they are supporting us strongly we didnt go to the opening ceremony because we needed to focus on todays race but we watched it until the german team came in
2499043 we expected new zealand to win but also saw in training that we were going faster than the czechs so our aim was for second place to prepare we had two weeks training camp in bled where the weather was hotter and less humid so it was a good preparation and we have been here for a week we didnt go to the opening ceremony because of todays race but we watched it on tv along with athletes from tennis volleyball swimming and others
2499044 the race did not go to plan it was not too good
2499045 its good finally to row in this olympic regatta its been a long time coming its quite hard to focus because although this is a smaller event than the world championships were against the top ten crews so it will never be easy we had a tough race and will have to pull out all the stops
2499046 starting with the world championships weve tried to build up to our peak for the olympic games new zealand are favourites but they are only favourites because they have good competitors like us we are going to keep making it hard for them until the end we have good relations with the rest of our team and we get more and more young rowers each year our families are not here but phone and watch us on tv i hope they will read this quote the chinese are helpful and funny even if we dont understand each other its fun to try to communicate
2499047 today weve learned how tough olympic competition is but also that we are in good shape because we won our heat we can only do one race at a time and will not predict what will happen next but weve competed together in 13 regattas and won medals in 11 of those so theres no reason why we cant win a medal here the headwind slowed us down so the times dont look so good the climate doesnt make a difference during the race but makes it harder to recover after the finish we think our main competitors are the kiwis but belarus have already shown that they are tough and ready to fight and of course theres also slovenia and france the chinese are so helpful they even followed us into the toilet to show us where the paper was
2499048 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2499049 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behavior
2499050 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2499051 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2499052 they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2499053 beijing is covered in skyscrapers and filled with cars and the people of china have more connections to the world than ever before

2499056 the democratic national convention is just a couple of weeks away it was four years ago at the same gathering that america heard a fine speech from an illinois state senator named barack obama hes done pretty well for himself since then and the smart money in denver is on another celebrated performance
2499057 but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall in the way of running mates senator obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2499058 a serious energy plan involves a lot more yeses than nos and that is why i say yes to drilling here and now yes to 45 more nuclear power plants to provide our country with electricity yes to clean coal technology so that we can create jobs and use americas most abundant resource yes to renewable energy sources so that we can shift away from petroleum over the long term yes to a break from the federal gasoline tax so that our government helps you in a time of need instead of just adding to your costs in short yes to all of the above to a bold plan for achieving energy independence that starts today

2499069 i mean look at these cola ads initially even i drank a lot of pepsi to become popular and get a girlfriend like deepika padukone but alas it was not to be all it did was to make be fat now everyone in college makes fun of me even the girls

2499079 abc said that edwards who has not taken a paternity test contended he could not be the father of hunters baby bec ause the affair ended before the childs conception
2499080 i learned at an early age that customers respond differently based on how you communicate with them
2499081 if you dont look at someone when youre talking to them it shows a lack of respect
2499082 because they like the food they know the employees and they like the way they are treated
2499083 i really enjoyed them being there to visit they are the nicest people i have ever met
2499084 id like to take one of them and try to burn rubber
2499085 we have been seeing them on the road in front of our house and we wanted to see them here
2499086 i really like that one the one with the flames on it
2499087 we drove it around so much this week that it broke down
2499088 when i was a kid my dad had a body shop
2499089 i had to go there after school to wait for him to get off of work well the guy next door made coffins and he drove one of these to work i have always wanted one
2499090 when other kids were reading comic books i was reading popular mechanics and they always talked about them
2499091 of course they cost about one dollar a pound but that 500 might as well have been 500 000 to a kid
2499092 the decision was approved today in the board meeting of our association to reduce the sufferings of the workers and also to raise the productivity of them
2499093 the enhancement will have a new pressure for us but we want a peaceful atmosphere in factories so that our production is not hampered and can sustain growth
2499094 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2499095 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2499096 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2499097 russian military forces have gone through all the red lines by crossing an internationally recognised border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2499098 this is a clear act with visible elements of aggression and an outrageous violation of international law with grave consequences to regional and euro atlantic stability and security as well as to euro atlantic relations with russia
2499099 iran is ready to offer any help under its principal policies of contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the region
2499100 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences
2499101 endings are all the same beginnings are always more interesting but true connoisseurs are known to favor the stretch in between
2499102 itajte priop enja ne trebamo se previ e uzbu ivati trebamo se zaustaviti na sada njim problemima a ne se vra ati u pro lost
2499103 ive always thought this well hes a great mentor to the younger players stuff is overrated i take that responsibility seriously because there were guys who mentored me but if youre not playing and youre not productive thats a bunch of hogwash
2499104 i tried to rationalize all the reasons to stay here but my gut kept telling me that situation wasnt right and i couldnt make it right
2499105 he wants to play every down heck i cant blame him
2499106 im not to say that he cant i had to give him an honest evaluation of where we were
2499107 im naturally a slim dude especially at this time of year when were practicing two times a day
2499108 i really dont feel like it hurts me on the field
2499109 of course being a little bulkier and heavier could help me but i just have to give great effort
2499110 he trains with a passion and intensity thats matched by few
2499111 some things have been accomplished but the main goal is that yellow butter medal and its on the podium waiting for somebody to take it i plan on doing so
2499112 he wrestles with an attitude a toughness and meanness hes not scared to smack you to pop you in the head and thats part of wrestling
2499113 we talk about being physical if one guy is more physical than the other he can be dominating and henry never allows a guy to be more physical than him hes a fighter at heart
2499114 i always had to fight for things blanket remote control food
2499115 i was always like that ever since i was a little kid ive always had that mentality
2499116 we have been playing better and i think if i stay we can win even i dont stay these guys can win but i believe i can help
2499117 up to the trading deadline she can still travel we checked
2499118 it would be tough for her to move but shes been totally supportive i have not worried to this point why start now
2499119 im getting used to it looking back at 05 we probably have 10 12 guys on that whole team its nothing new it is just the way this business is
2499120 thats cause my mommas always been on my back about everything
2499121 i guess i should get bobby turners name on my back too
2499122 he wants you to be on top of your game at all times and if youre not youre gone
2499123 we were joking before we went out there that it was a make or break game for fuentes if we lose hes gone
2499124 theres not one guy in here who view slide show of padres rockies series evaluate boxscores team leaders and more on rockies stats page ask troy e renck about the team or mlb in the rockies mailbag study previews probable pitchers lineups and in progress gamecasts for nl and al pore over pre game stats matchups boxscores and live scoring for nl and al post photos of you and your loved ones showing rockies spirit wants him traded for us to stay in contention and make a run at this thing we need him
2499125 if they can get an ace for me i would trade myself i understand that its a business and they have to do whats best for the organization
2499126 but i want to be here because i believe we can win
2499127 this was a big game wed hate to come here today and not see fuentes in the clubhouse
2499128 after my first at bat i talked with him and he said i was pulling off the ball a little early to just concentrate on hitting it up the middle
2499129 it is a hope that he will recover for the third days play
2499130 he has proved that you really have to work hard to get going i think it is a very good test match so far
2499131 we are excited about it its huge for our little town
2499132 in my mind he was going to be racing leadville regardless of any announcement ive been getting ready
2499133 it will be tough but how cool is that to have him doing this race its going to be very special
2499134 look at utah byu tcu new mexico and wyoming all five have a starting quarterback returning
2499135 it may take some focus in terms of practice planning and preparation
2499136 we have players who are pretty good football players but they havent played a lot of college football
2499137 its true at every position you just come in and play practice improve and compete thats what football is all about
2499138 there are quite a few players on this team who dont have a ton of game experience we had a great class of seniors last year to learn from
2499139 its exciting for me im ready to get that first snap and get started
2499140 it was one of the most miserable 20 day periods of my life
2499141 the 48 hours in the simulated pow camp when youre going through it youre thinking there is nothing worse than this and yet id also tell you that it was one of the greatest sources of pride in my life too
2499142 it develops even more mental toughness in a kid here at the air force academy
2499143 as a football coach here you have to have that on your team
2499144 i got a little sick the first time but they said thats normal i enjoyed it and i definitely want to get back up there
2499145 his focus has been great hes not letting any of that stuff affect him i tell people that brandons not a bad find out what players are where on first preseaon depth chart view slide show of broncos training camp view slide show of nfl training camps watch video of jay cutler following thursdays practice read lindsay jones entries on the all things broncos blog ask mike klis about the team or nfl in the broncos mailbag read the latest commentaries by jim armstrong from training camp post photos of you and your loved ones showing broncos spirit guy hes just been in the right place at the wrong time hopefully the commissioner will give him another chance and not suspend him and he can be a threat for this team
2499146 ive been telling guys having had a chance to be with az hakim in detroit and st louis hes another version of him with more speed with the kind of player he is hes a gadget guy hes a reverse guy a guy who can go deep a guy who can catch screens
2499147 you never can think like that you always come out and put your best foot forward and thats what im trying to do
2499148 you know deep down inside i know my game is solid my game is strong
2499149 my head is good and im relaxed if i dont play well it doesnt really bother me but at the same time i do want to go out there and perform well
2499150 you know he still has the game to play he just chooses not to play this is his third week in a row and hes got that competition now under his fingernails
2499151 i have been disappointed in my two finishes the last few weeks which is a very good sign
2499152 i could have said i was happy with third place but quite honestly i was upset
2499153 they are one in the same they take care of the acreage and then they chip and putt
2499154 its reflected in my game but its more contentment with life
2499155 i know every human being sometimes feels like they are the only one at the end of the branch and nobody else is with them when things are going bad
2499156 but when things are going great and youre happy about everything it permeates through everything you have in life my golf is where it is now because i love being where i am now
2499157 its pretty hard to find time to slot in a tournament let alone anything else
2499158 there is no break ive got to get back to work next week ive had nearly a month away and have a lot of catching up to do
2499159 ive put my heart and soul into this comeback and have done everything i could to get ready in time to compete in beijing but ive made a decision to step aside
2499160 for my comeback to be successful i needed to make continuous progress and have no setbacks
2499161 ive talked it over with my coach miles avery and he agrees that i would not be prepared to contribute to the team
2499162 its kind of tough because youre happy to be considered one second and then it goes downhill its kind of a roller coaster ride
2499163 ive got to support this team and show them im ready in case anything does happen god forbid but you never know in this sport
2499164 from the beginning my attempt at a comeback has been a long shot
2499165 the time frame i was given was extremely short this has been the hardest decision ive ever had to make but i have too much respect for the olympics and my team to continue on when i know the best thing for everyone is for me to step aside
2499166 the commissioner is furious about it what youve got is a system thats broken
2499167 were not going to have him practice until he gets back to his reporting weight
2499168 although i still have to get a place worked out
2499169 he antonopulos just walks by me and tells me where im at
2499170 when it gets really hot out it gets a little sticky and i dont like messing with it
2499171 on this river anytime the water gets above 55 degrees the trout will always be looking up
2499172 i could give you every attractor dry fly in the box and they all would work
2499173 the fish seem to key on a different fly a little bit more than others each day i cant tell you how long its been since we had this much fun fishing dry flies on this river
2499174 we get spoiled with the easy walking during low water but fishing actually is much better when the water is high
2499175 with very few people on the river we definitely have well rested fish
2499176 at low water the rafts are very disturbing to the fish
2499177 now with all the fish on the bank theres not much problem
2499178 i havent seen a day when the dry fly isnt better than the nymph
2499179 i was in charge of killing gophers and changing holes
2499180 anytime you get the lead especially in the first inning you like your chances
2499181 by the time he made contact i was way too far off
2499182 all i heard before we left is that its a make or break trip well if we leave 3 3 have we done bad or good
2499183 its a lot better than we have done we need to separate the emotion
2499184 im hopeful this is not the end of the tournament that when the time is right i think we will be back
2499185 ive put my heart and soul into this comeback and have done everything i could to get ready in time to compete in beijing but ive made a decision to step aside
2499186 for my comeback to be successful i needed to make continuous progress and have no setbacks
2499187 ive talked it over with my coach miles avery and he agrees that i would not be prepared to contribute to the team
2499188 its kind of tough because youre happy to be considered one second and then it goes downhill its kind of a roller coaster ride
2499189 ive got to support this team and show them im ready in case anything does happen god forbid but you never know in this sport
2499190 from the beginning my attempt at a comeback has been a longshot
2499191 the time frame i was given was extremely short this has been the hardest decision ive ever had to make but i have too much respect for the olympics and my team to continue on when i know the best thing for everyone is for me to step aside
2499192 it really kind of blew me away this offseason because my whole career i only missed two games and that wasnt because of my knee it was because of a high thigh bruise
2499193 this offseason it just got blown out of proportion everyone is making a big deal about the knee but ive been fine
2499194 when i took the visit here to denver they told me the scheme how they do things and how they run the defense and they made it clear i would fit perfectly in that scheme
2499195 this is much better for him because i can go back to when he was in college and i studied him
2499196 when you play him in a head up position you negate some of that quickness and power
2499197 he was a gentle giant because he could be so respectful off the field but man when he got on the field he rag dolled people just tore people to pieces
2499198 the nba the players and the fans relied on him to perform his job in an honest manner
2499199 ive brought shame on myself my family and watch a video report of nba ref tim donaghy after he was sentenced to 15 months in prison the profession
2499200 if you dont make a statement out there it gets full speed and eventually someone gets hurt
2499201 he had a little pain in that area so we told him to stay away
2499202 the example theyre setting in terms of their work ethic and being prepared for practice its contagious
2499203 we had to practice in camp where there were helicopters over head with dog killer
2499204 it was kind of weird you couldnt really get focused in on football
2499205 i enjoyed playing with him i learned a lot from him
2499206 weve lost a lot but thats life in the nfl
2499207 of course hes the best safety ive ever played with but hes also going down as one of the best safeties in league history when i came off the field hes always the first one to talk to me hamza you did this right you did this wrong he grades me hard his standards for me are almost as high as i put on myself for a guy to invest that much in me i love that about john
2499208 i left a lot of putters around the country in two pieces
2499209 if you broke a club it would cost you a lot of money i got into a whole bunch of trouble and i paid a whole bunch of fines
2499210 if anybody is smart enough theyll get a caddie who knows that course
2499211 golf is a lot different at that altitude than at sea level you cant spin the ball and move it like you can at lower elevation
2499212 i always enjoyed getting up on one of the holes and looking back on the hotel and the mountains
2499213 it was a new course when i went up there in 1963
2499214 it took a few years for me to figure out the course but once i knew it i had a two to four shot edge a day i could take a 4 iron out and play nine holes the broadmoor is a lot different than that
2499215 it seemed as if my game came around that time of the year it would stick for three or four months but i never could consistently hold it at that same level all year i went through a spell with my driver where i couldnt put the ball in a 120 acre field i never could putt at oakmont or oakland hills in detroit
2499216 the old body wouldnt go anymore all those years of playing smoking and drinking will catch up with you i always was a free spirit good or bad i didnt give a dang what people thought about what i did i think i was good for the game
2499217 in my day i would have liked to have given it a go against tiger
2499218 hes the best player any of us will see in our lifetime and hes the best player our grandchildren will see in their lifetime hes what you call perfect from one end to the other and lord have mercy he can putt
2499219 our law enforcement arm will be one of the primary groups that will enforce the scope of the public easement deciding what is inside or outside that easement
2499220 any proposed legislation would try to limit the easement or eliminate it
2499221 it would have been frustrating regardless of how im playing
2499222 if i continue to go out there and it broke all the way through it would be much more serious
2499223 i am glad to get this chance and i am ready to contribute
2499224 you never know lets just say ive come a long way
2499225 ive talked to the coaches and they want me to do it the right way
2499226 the most important thing is to be healthy with it anybody can just drop weight any kind of way i could do that and be back on the field in two days but i dont know how healthy that would be here in the heat
2499227 im already behind its already an issue to me it cant get any bigger than it is right now
2499228 when youre playing you dont have time to stop and smell the roses and understand what youve accomplished
2499229 being from colorado being the only one i cant comprehend it
2499230 a lot of people will play and a lot of people will catch balls
2499231 i think torain above can be part of the solution by becoming part of the committee i think the 25 carry a game workhorse days are history
2499232 i was like the reliever coming in but now ive been relieved of my duties my cousins are old view a slideshow of photos of training camp day 2 watch video of the broncos training camp day 1 enough now
2499233 i would never own a restaurant seeing what they went through
2499234 its a crazy business they put in 80 hours a week plus any business where theres cash involved its hard to trust people thats why we get the family involved but theyre trying to get rid of it
2499235 this is day 3 and we finally get do a little banging
2499236 at the end of otas he looked a little sluggish you could tell there was soreness in his leg area but since hes been back for training camp he has looked much better his legs are back and he is improving every day
2499237 you just cant get them to hit your lures all they have to do is swim up and open their mouths and theyre full
2499238 its a great place for kids except parents spend most of their time taking fish off the hook
2499239 theyre very plentiful but the body condition factor also is good
2499240 these guys are crazy and the sooner they start learning the better
2499241 you can never rule out at the tour de france the biggest event of the year that these guys are going to take risks
2499242 he says that it was for cramps but that he forgot to tell the team doctor
2499243 theyve been slacking sometime this week well have to get someone to do it right whether i have to do it myself or not
2499244 for the first time it was good to be big
2499245 i always tell people that i love football because it was the first time a big person had a place offensive line is for big guys and it gave me a sense of home
2499246 i know that if i want to have a chance to start i have to play my best football
2499247 we have a lot of good hitters on this team from top to bottom anybody can hurt you
2499248 i dont think we put up big numbers we just found a way to score one more run than the other team were finding ways to barrel up bats this time weve had a lot of good at bats
2499249 i just try to get a good pitch and hit it
2499250 they say hitting is contagious and i guess it is
2499251 its one of the strangest games ive ever been a part of
2499252 youre left completely disappointed but you dont know what to get mad at the effort was there the attitude was there the attacking was there the possession was there
2499253 but once you miss one then two then three then four and before you know it the game is over and you havent scored yet
2499254 weve tweaked the golf course design to look more like a ross course
2499255 but its a combination of the two the first six holes are ross designs holes seven through 15 are jones design and we go back to ross again for 16 through 18
2499256 theres nothing tricky about it the length of it wont bother these players theyll earn their money around the greens and negotiating the rough
2499257 hale irwins a great shotmaker he knows how to handle pressure
2499258 the bullpen was a junkyard for starters who couldnt pitch anymore
2499259 please dont compare todays relievers with what we used to do its apples and oranges
2499260 i think the way they are used today is the right way but it wasnt always like that
2499261 there are a lot of fellows making a great living pitching only the ninth inning
2499262 rollie had to be a reliever because he was a poor starter the more he waited around to pitch the more nervous he got eventually we put him in a stopper role he could throw three or four days in a row and i believed then like i do now that the more you throw the stronger you get
2499263 you have to have a really good team with a chance to be ahead in several ballgames every week two you have to have a legitimate shutdown closer three you have to have a solid enough bullpen to get the outs before the ninth which we had and four you have to have a pitching coach who is bright enough to think of it dave duncan put it all together for us
2499264 they have evolved as units unto themselves but it would be difficult to move back to the way it was
2499265 they have it easy it takes three guys to do what i did
2499266 insofern ist es auch eine verletzung von v lkerrecht wenn jetzt hier ein solcher versuch gemacht wird milit risch vorzugehen
2499267 es ist ein sinnloser ein blutiger krieg der das problem dieser abtr nnigen provinz s dossetien von georgien mit sicherheit nicht l sen wird
2499268 diese skepsis wird durch die aktuellen vorg nge verst rkt
2499269 er muss wissen wer anf ngt zu eskalieren bringt kr fte an den tag die er nicht mehr kontrollieren kann
2499270 ich rufe alle zur m igung auf aber russland verh lt sich nicht neutral in diesem konflikt sondern sucht die auseinandersetzung mit georgien und hat zur eskalation der lage beigetragen
2499271 der kreml hat diese zwangslage ganz bewusst herbei gef hrt
2499272 i will wave my magic wand and these things will happen and actually work what no cap and trade will not raise prices make us less
2499273 the third shot just knuckled on me its real disappointing but what can you do
2499274 i really didnt think i had much of a chance to get in the playoff
2499275 but when i did i kind of got a second wind but after i bogeyed the hole in regulation i was packed up and ready to go home
2499276 you could tell the guys who went down the right side wanted to go for it
2499277 to me i just wanted to lay up and either try for a birdie or par the old fashioned way either way its a risk i just got lucky with the last putt
2499278 i dont know about arrived but it does put me closer to the goals ive set for myself
2499279 coach said i told you you didnt have to come out here
2499280 but ive never had to miss a practice ever i might be a safety in the league but no matter where im at im going to have to play special teams its just one of our duties i was surprised that was a huge bone they threw me i was able to go home and see my little girl shes usually asleep when i leave in the morning and asleep when i get home so that was a good time
2499281 but im really excited for hamza mike shanahan talks all the time that you have an opportunity to be a special player when you match talent with want to and desire work ethic and professionalism and hamzas got all those things the game is extremely important to him
2499282 the positions are fairly similar because theyre both about blocking
2499283 theyre letting me play and giving me a chance thats all you can ask for
2499284 i like jay he is a laid back mellow type of guy im used to jeff garcia the fiery type jay is a great find out what players are where on first preseaon depth chart view slide show of broncos training camp view slide show of nfl training camps watch video of jay cutler following thursdays practice read lindsay jones entries on the all things broncos blog ask mike klis about the team or nfl in the broncos mailbag read the latest commentaries by jim armstrong from training camp post photos of you and your loved ones showing broncos spirit quarterback he is a young guy but he shows great leadership
2499285 its been a long process and now i can concentrate on my gymnastics compete with my team and hopefully bring back a medal for the usa
2499286 if people are going to hate theyre going to hate but youve got to keep being who you are
2499287 i think i sold myself too short last year i should have had more i should have had at least 15

2499292 i dont think it would be worth my effort to fly to colorado just to watch you play 12 holes
2499293 it was one of the most lopsided victories weve had
2499294 it was the first time the match was held this far west
2499295 any position you put me on i can guard thats what i do
2499296 new york was great but thats in my past now denver is my future
2499297 i am not going to make a decision on santos until i have to
2499298 i couldnt get a grip on the ball i had no command of my fastball
2499299 i look forward to getting out there again to redeem myself
2499300 you think about it because it could happen especially now with whatever the commissioner has been doing
2499301 i just hope he looks at all the facts and doesnt rush to judgment on anything
2499302 hes our no 1 guy the guy we look to to make the big plays for us so it changes dramatically
2499303 but weve got other guys that can step in and fill that void
2499304 theres a lot of competition out there even right now to make the team
2499305 you dont know whos going to be out there come september but with what weve got to work with its going to be a good product out there on the field
2499306 it would be safe to say wed be without our best player in the group everyone is talented but he is extremely talented he is the head of our group
2499307 if that happens we have to be able to hold it down for him while hes out
2499308 hes making plays left and right and he is just going to keep getting better and better as his body gets back into football shape
2499309 i cant say enough how sorry we are and its our responsibility being nascar that we dont go through this situation again
2499310 the race didnt come off like we had hoped the fans didnt get what they exactly wanted and well do everything in our power it wont happen again i can tell you that much
2499311 its obvious that we didnt go there with the right car slash tire combination
2499312 as a kayaker i understood the benefits of a plastic molded boat
2499313 they are incredibly durable quiet with clean lines and very few hang up spots weve tried to establish what we consider several points of difference in our boats and to our knowledge we have the only river dory that has been tested and approved by the u s coast guard flip it over and it still floats like a raft
2499314 thats obviously the first step in brett coming back so well deal with that when he is reinstated and well definitely have a plan in order
2499315 hell be starting all of the games as the starter
2499316 we dont want a lot of people seeing him so thats why were not saying where he is
2499317 its just unreal when you see these guys go at it
2499318 last year we were watching the progression of the sport evolve as people were bringing out their best tricks on their last run
2499319 this course is built for the top pro riders in the world
2499320 this is spectator stuff not something that would work for the general public at least not for a few years anyway
2499321 the past four years at winter park have been a transformation from cross country only to focusing on gravity thats when we started the process of checking out and planning new trails and working with the forest service to establish a master plan for the next 10 years
2499322 what we determined along with the forest service is to focus on the style of trails we have here and do it well we have chairlifts up here and in the valley they dont so we want to make sure the downhill community is riding here not building renegade trails down in the valley
2499323 winter parks gravity fed stuff sort of naturally separates the use just in terms of topography
2499324 weve been working with a variety of entities in the fraser valley to preserve and make more sustainable some of the cross country trails and expand to make it even more of a destination than it already is now
2499325 winter park really is one of the on ground partners in terms of getting this ride center project going around the country
2499326 because the forest service process takes time we wanted to make sure that were showing our commitment and thats where crankworx came in
2499327 the whistler guys are helping us with design and layout of trails up on the mountain they were looking to expand their event and said it looks like you guys would be a perfect fit with everything youve got going on so we decided to take it on
2499328 the cross country community for years has sort of seen downhill as sort of a lazy mans biking they had this vision of downhillers as lazy fat bikers who cant climb but thats not the case it just takes time for people to really realize what its about
2499329 the mentality of i dont do that because im this style of rider has started to change
2499330 the first five innings in his last two or three starts hes been very sharp
2499331 hes been able to throw any pitch in any count
2499332 its only two games in a row well see if i can go for three in a row
2499333 five walks on a night is never a number you are looking to throw up there
2499334 but at the same time he had some electric stuff tonight eight punch outs
2499335 i feel like this is really between brett and the organization and im just trying to stay focused on the things i can control
2499336 i was expecting elephants and different things to kind of be out there
2499337 theres a lot of media and stuff but it wasnt a case where there were trapeze artists
2499338 but i always said if i didnt play with denver the one place i would want to play is atlanta and it just happened to completely fall into place
2499339 its really been a blessing just to come back home
2499340 you go out here as long as you think you can effectively
2499341 when is the right time to get out i dont know i still have expenses i dont think ill go on forever but i dont think now is the time for me to be lying down and going away either
2499342 this year has just not been a good year at all for a lot of reasons my mom dying was one theres just been some circumstances outside the ropes but i feel good
2499343 hale isnt competing against us or the golf course anymore hes competing against father time
2499344 when i came here earlier this month frankly i couldnt remember some of the holes
2499345 but youre talking about over 40 years of tree growth its certainly different now im just like these other guys here
2499346 this is a full week for me i have other things going on
2499347 no matter where home is when you come back and play in front of home people and family and friends its more difficult it absolutely is more difficult those things can take away from your thought process
2499348 for anyone to think that utah can beat michigan in anything let alone football is absurd
2499349 be open to learning new lessons even if they contradict the lessons you learned yesterday
2499350 not only the members but the staff and all of the alums that are either here in the stadium or on the internet following us its been a heck of a ride and were just pleased to be back in finals
2499351 the competition is great the corps are very strong from top to bottom and weve really worked hard to be in that elite finalist group our members our staff and our design team have done a fabulous job
2499352 we feel like we have one more great show in us we want to go out on a high note and obviously enjoy it but we also are here to do our job and bring a great quality show to the field
2499353 i think the guys have been set up for success all season long weve been talking about the many ways we evaluate the season and striving to emphasize personal growth were very happy of course to get another chance to perform and i think the crowds happy about that we were prepared for tonight to go either way
2499354 theres something about knowing with 100 percent certainty that youre about to perform your final show and i think it allows guys to let go of any fear any nervousness that they have and just be themselves
2499355 this is the best age out experience i could ever ask for
2499356 todays performance was the best of my life and i hope i have a better one tomorrow
2499357 these guys are crazy and the sooner they start learning the better
2499358 you can never rule out at the tour de france the biggest event of the year that these guys are going to take risks
2499359 he says that it was for cramps but that he forgot to tell the team doctor
2499360 the faces of the riders burnt out exhausted mouths wide open at the end the fight against doping has made enormous progress
2499361 the difference between those who cheat and those who chase after them has considerably narrowed
2499362 that means that either the riders were in better health or that its proof theyre not taking as many substances
2499363 when he was young we thought that one day he could attempt the tour de france
2499364 this is the dream of my life thats become a reality now
2499365 i was feeling better and better and was in top form at the end of this week
2499366 i think i have three or four good tours left in me
2499367 i have never been depressed enough to take up the game but they say you can get so sore at yourself that you forget to hate your enemies
2499368 jack nicklaus once said of this place you can hit 17 greens out here and still end up shooting 82 all day long
2499369 with a normal 25 footer you think automatic two putt but there are no automatics here
2499370 the best place to read these greens is from somewhere near the air force academy as youre driving down
2499371 if you look at cheyenne mountain from the academy youll see this long sloping ridge
2499372 its always the same degree of drop coming off the mountain until it disappears into the city theres a very continuous drop gravity takes everything that way
2499373 you were lucky to have use of a steam shovel in those days
2499374 they could only move so much dirt so the greens and fairways followed the natural contour of the land
2499375 when youre talking about this piece of property that means a slope from west to east people come in all mad after a round and say hey this isnt supposed to be augusta we kind of take that as a positive
2499376 there are very few putts that youll play inside the cup thats just the way it is even 2 and 3 footers will test you every time
2499377 what really makes the greens difficult for the typical player is the speed change from hole to hole
2499378 when youre above the hole theyre just fast when youre below the hole they can be slow going up the slope to make that muscle memory change from that fast to that slow is difficult and there are situations out here where the player cant even see the difference
2499379 speed is everything youll see resort players running their first putt 15 feet by the cup and then leaving their next putt 8 feet short theyre forever flustered
2499380 youd much rather have a 20 foot uphill putt than an 8 foot downhill putt
2499381 we dont want uphill putts rolling back to a guys feet
2499382 i think the regular tour players will figure them out pretty quickly
2499383 but theyd better not hit their approach shots to a bad spot
2499384 if you had a game every other year or every third or fourth year you could have a governors cup
2499385 we already play csu and csu already plays cu right now its not on the horizon but there has to be a way to get that meshed together

2499403 ha estado concentrando tropas en nuestra frontera bajo la excusa de ejercicios y simulacros
2499404 hay que puntualizar lo que es el estado de guerra

2499408 you dont expect a no hitter from a 30th round draft pick
2499409 were going to keep moving him up until the league and level of competition catches up with him he threw 112 pitches in the no hitter and 100 were fastballs he needs a lot of work on his secondary pitches
2499410 at that time i just was thinking about making my pitches i throw four pitches a fastball changeup slider and curveball
2499411 i was so pumped and trying hard to keep my composure the crowd was making a lot of noise and the ball went right off the palm of my glove but i think it helped relax me for the last two outs
2499412 i have to get past it and get back to work my next start is tuesday and i cant keep celebrating
2499413 it looks like you are going to have to go out and shoot another good score
2499414 somebody could easily go out there and go 6 or 7 under if someone gets hot
2499415 with this course youve got to take it day by day because the conditions change and there are a lot of outside factors i dont want to put a number in my head
2499416 im definitely not as nervous being in the last couple of groups and always feel now that when i shoot under par that i could have gotten a little more out of it and frustrated with where i am as opposed to kind of grinding as hard as i could

2499419 of the three rookie defensive linemen i thought tim really flashed in the early part of the season
2499420 he really flashed and consequently he was the first one to run into a wall
2499421 its a brand new year weve all grown and matured in the past year i believe in my heart we are ready to take that next step
2499422 i remember after game 6 thinking weve played 10 games already counting preseason
2499423 i was like man weve got 10 more games to go but this year is better than last year so im prepared i feel a lot better coming into camp
2499424 i think all three of them have made the necessary adjustments
2499425 first of all lets be honest its not easy playing three rookies you have to and you have to survive but the fact all three played as rookies thats a big advantage for us as we go forward
2499426 i dont know where were at on the defensive line i do know this i feel so much more comfortable this year
2499427 its door handle to door handle racing as my dad and i used to call it when we played with our slot car track
2499428 it was the side by side action sometimes straight away sometimes four wide and you didnt see that in other major racing series
2499429 obviously the moneys not a bad thing but as far as just pure racing at the highest level nascar has always been it in my eyes
2499430 if people are going to hate theyre going to hate but youve got to keep being who you are
2499431 so late already still here gambling are the four of you residents here
2499432 good timber does not grow with the ease the stronger the wind the stronger the trees
2499433 it is not anger it is cold calculation a normal episode in which i was insulted a little i did write a book about him
2499434 everybody knew that we were friends so it would be unnatural for us to stop talking so if he wanted to cut communication he would have to do something cruel
2499435 i was in a difficult situation i said he is a good candidate but i am not in a position to judge the others
2499436 i knew sooner or later it would happen was cut from his circle like others before it is sad he died unfortunately without a single friend he was absolutely isolated he didnt have anyone who came to discuss politics with him
2499437 the better purity of heart is now realized by us the more our contemplation in heaven will be full and splendid
2499438 i even maintain that already now purity of heart is an imitation of

2499440 are you nervous to be on the radio because i am
2499441 its an amazing place but for me it was very overwhelming to see children in so much pain it was nice to play games with them and make children really happy
2499442 it wasnt me who taught cruz to do that i have two left feet when it comes to dancing
2499443 its a difference maker it can mean the difference between a medal or no medal when youre talking about athletes at this level
2499444 weve seen evidence over the last 10 years from studies which all show that recovery has become more and more important especially in this kind of warm weather
2499445 the body doesnt settle down until the core cools down so athletes come to us all the time and say they feel more lethargic and tired when they dont do these sessions
2499446 this isnt my idea of fun but our bodies feel so much better after it you can really tell the difference its dramatic you always feel refreshed and ready to go the next day whereas i know in the past when youre playing so many matches in the heat eventually you just find it really hard to back up the next day
2499447 its important for us because weve got to win seven matches if they are to win a gold medal so coming here is going to help us a lot
2499448 here we can just chill out and spend time with other aussies its really great
2499449 its good to get away from the village because youre really starting to feel the pressure there
2499450 revenues realized through the google print ads program google audio ads google tv ads google checkout youtube and postini were not material in any of the periods presented
2499451 ive been celibate for a year and starting to think i may never have sex again
2499452 its not something i planned but i just dont get asked out any more
2499453 men seem to look at me and think she went out with george clooney what chance have i got
2499454 the hardest thing is dealing with people who think i was going out with george to further my career in fact offers almost totally dried up people assumed i wouldnt be interested in modelling again
2499455 i instantly felt relaxed i was exhausted but also excited my job is done
2499456 in fact i am the true torchbearer almost all torches used outside the mainland went through my hands one by one
2499457 i was shocked the way the cauldron was lit was extremely risky i dont think the designers ever considered the possibility that the torchs flame might go out
2499458 imagine the wind up there dozens of meters up in the air there was no contingency plan just one man hanging there and yet we had to be 100 percent sure or the entire country would be embarrassed
2499459 the loop around the birds nest took four minutes fifty seconds and xiangyun normally burns for 15 minutes we added a bit more fuel to make sure it kept going
2499460 id give it all up for the right man but i love my career so itd be a struggle
2499461 where am i going to find a man wholl do that
2499462 i wanted a nose job but now my nose is what lets me change my face a lot and i can be glamorous as agent 99 in get smart then look rough as a drug addict for director jonathan demme in forthcoming movie rachel getting married

2499525 our dream team was not blowing it off but it didnt matter if they were playing or not then all of a sudden chuck threw that at them the next day the college kids didnt score for the first 10 minutes and they got beat by about 40 in a 20 minute scrimmage
2499526 maybe not clinically diagnosed but it was such a heartbreaker to lose two opportunities for a medal back to back

2499535 hyderabad has been ruled out and an afc delegation will inspect the ambedkar satdium in delhi tomorrow morning and take a decision in the afternoon whether to hold the final there the date for the final and third place play off will be decided after inspection in delhi but the match will be held within a week
2499536 the matches on august 10 have been postponed and the amended schedule will be announced tomorrow
2499537 we have three options now first it may be played tomorrow as scheduled either at the gachibowli stadium or lal bahadur stadium here the second option is to shift the venue to another city and play within a week the last option is to postpone the game for a month or two
2499538 the ground at gachibowli was also unplayable and with the kind of rain here it will be worse tomorrow the match then will not be decided by football skills it will be a shame if a final match of such an important tournament is decided by factors not connected to football
2499539 lal bahadur stadium was no better than gachibowli it will be an embarrassment for the afc and aiff if the final is played at lbs which is a cricket ground
2499540 i dont know which place we would like to play with rain everywhere in the country but dont tell me kolkata

2499651 a ffording same sex couples only a separate and differently named family relationship will as a realistic matter impose appreciable harm on same sex couples and their children because denying such couples access to the familiar and highly favored designation of marriage is likely to cast doubt on whether the official family relationship of same sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite sex couples

2499697 anybody who says they know when its going to end with confidence is delusional
2499698 but yes you can get a sense of where things are going
2499699 as long as anyone can remember as long as we have data mortgage rates have been about 1 6 percent above the 10 year treasury rate
2499700 today its more like 2 5 percent above the 10 year treasury thats a gigantic difference literally reducing the amount of house someone could afford by 20 percent

2499710 el hecho de que las tropas rusas penetren actualmente en osetia del sur es claramente una respuesta a la decisi n georgiana de intentar tomar el control de la provincia
2499711 fue muy irracional hacer eso porque no creo que los occidentales vayan a ir a rescatarle
2499712 romperles la nariz a los georgianos darles una peque a lecci n pero tambi n mostrar que tienen intereses en esta regi n y la intenci n de defenderlos
2499713 a lo mejor no ten an que haber comenzado esto pero no permitir n que georgia tome este tipo de medidas sin repercusiones
2499714 es por eso que rusia tiene inter s en impedir la resoluci n de los conflictos separatistas
2499715 esto puede que forme parte de la reacci n rusa pero creo que el factor principal ha sido que los rusos no se esperaban que los georgianos enfrentar n este asunto con medios militares
2499716 la envergadura de la operaci n militar georgiana era tal que ha provocado una reacci n rusa
2499717 habr an podido prever que los rusos iban a responder

2499721 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2499722 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2499724 south east asia has plummeted to levels it took europe 150 years to reach in just 30 years
2499725 the span of fertility across countries has never been wider
2499726 both extremes cause their own problems if europe continues at 1 5 the population will halve every 65 years if africa continues with half its population under 15 it will continue to consume more than it produces making it harder to escape from poverty and illiteracy
2499727 if i were a gambler i would take even money that england will not exist in the year 2000
2499728 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
2499729 theres been an extraordinary change in 20 years and it comes from a combination of factors
2499730 they have had 5 to 6 per cent economic growth over the past 15 years and in areas like the textile industry that provides work for lots of ordinary people a woman can earn 25 30 a month in a garment factory thats big money and if you have two daughters working it is delaying the age at which women marry it used to be 14 or 15 now its 21 or 22 another factor is the success of ngos non governmental organisations 20 million households in bangladesh have access to micro finance and in half of them the money goes to the women then there has been education for girls encouraged by programmes that gave cereals to families whose girls went to secondary school and cash for education female stipends
2499731 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
2499732 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
2499733 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
2499734 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
2499735 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose
2499736 many women in the developed world will become overloaded and respond by cutting down the number of children they have

2499744 it was a struggle for me i did my best to be ready for this week but clearly i am not what can i say the harder i tried the worse it got im just not with it obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2499745 at the moment probably not unless i do something pretty good in my last couple of tournaments
2499746 darren got unlucky for two days but especially today when it became a bit of a running joke in the group
2499747 i thought darren played way better than i did but he kept getting unfortunate bounces and bad breaks his game is really good hes rolling it beautifully and hitting it really solid
2499748 he brings a lot more to the table at the ryder cup than a good golf game part of the ryder cup is its history the pressure and the whole friendship thing if i was in nick faldos shoes i wouldnt even think twice
2499749 when youre just not mentally strong its hard to stop your mind from simply wandering away and thats what my mind was doing today
2499750 i thought i was ready coming in but im not i dont have the focus and thats clearly sign of being mentally fatigued i couldnt keep my mind quiet as i stood over the ball it was all rushed and blurring there was no calmness at all
2499751 i kept changing my mind mid swing and thats why i hit some really bad shots at the end
2499752 i realise that it takes a lot to come back and try and perform in a major two weeks after winning one maybe they are a bit too close
2499753 but if these are the consequences of winning the open then i am happy to accept them
2499754 hopefully ill be able to win the open for a third time in a row next summer and see how it works out after that though ideally id like to have a six week break after winning a major
2499755 id planned to work on a couple of things on the practice range this afternoon but ill go back to the house to rest instead i think i need to spend 24 hours in bed now
2499756 maybe ill be better tomorrow who knows i was telling myself all day theres plenty of golf left in this tournament to turn it all around just be patient yet you can say that all you like but when you stand over your ball and cant get your mind to settle it becomes very tough
2499757 i guess my putter was the key ive got to think this round is right up there with the best ive played all year its come at a good time as i knew this week was going to be vital if im to get into the ryder cup

2499803 o presidente georgiano mikhail saakashvili tomou uma decis o muito arriscada de lan ar durante a madrugada de sexta feira uma ofensiva militar contra a regi o da oss tia do sul apoiada por moscou

2499933 il ny a que des qualit s dans ce groupe les faiblesses on les oublie cest derri re nous maintenant fabien gilot apporte pas mal de s r nit ce relais il est calme serein ce qui apaise un peu tout le monde amaury leveaux cest la folie rires il en faut dans un relais boris et greg steimetz et mallet sont les plus jeunes de ce relais et les moins exp riment s au niveau international ils apportent leur insouciance alain bernard apporte de part son statut ce quil a fait cette ann e nous donne aussi beaucoup de confiance et moi je ne sais pas cest difficile de r pondre cette question peut tre mon exp rience parce que je suis le plus ancien et le plus g de ce relais ce seront mes troisi mes jeux
2499934 il ne faut pas quon tombe dans le pi ge en se disant que cest gagn davance rien nest fait sur le papier cest vrai quon a une tr s belle chance de m daille mais il faudra passer le pi ge des s ries et en finale on ne sera pas les seuls viser lor
2499935 les jeux olympiques en eux m mes peuvent tre un pi ge le fait que ce soit le plus gros v nement plan taire de ces quatre derni res ann es au niveau de la natation du moins a peut d stabiliser et puis il y aura des quipes autour de nous qui auront beaucoup plus dexp rience que la n tre il faudra se m fier de a notamment quand on sera dans le bassin avec cette atmosph re et plus de 15 000 spectateurs dans les tribunes
2499936 pour moi cest lid al parce quune comp tition comme les jeux peut faire peur commencer par une preuve par quipes a peut diviser la pression on peut sappuyer les uns sur les autres ce niveau l a ne peut tre que b n fique pour les relayeurs pour une bonne entr e en mati re et pour bien lancer ses jeux
2499937 on en parle beaucoup mais cette notion est d finitivement l avant darriver p kin on a eu vent des appartements disposition au village olympique il y a donc des appartements de quatre ou de six on a tout de suite dit quon prendrait un appartement de six pour tre ensemble pour quon ne se s pare pas cest un exemple de cet esprit collectif et puis on est rest en contact permanent depuis avril alors quon sest trouv parfois des milliers kilom tres les uns des autres a prouve quil y a un int r t commun
2499938 ce relais est n il y a quand m me pas mal dann es

2499940 on a envie de leur prouver que la france est galement une grosse nation de natation surtout quils sont quand m me assez arrogants ce niveau l et je le sais pour vivre l bas je sais comment ils ont lhabitude daborder ces grandes courses personnellement jai coeur de leur montrer de quoi on est capable quand on en discute entre nous on ne se dit pas quil faut terminer premiers mais quil faut les battre comme il faut battre les australiens
2499941 si on veut faire de belles choses il faudra quon soit tous notre meilleur niveau mais la niaque peut faire la diff rence ceux qui le voudront le plus lauront cest dans leau que a se passera m me si les prises de relais auront galement leur importance
2499942 on a notre petite id e mais je ne vous le r v lerai pas on ne sest pas encore assis tous les six et puis on ne sait pas encore qui viendra se greffer en finale alain et fabien les deux seuls assur s d tre titulaires rien nest d cid
