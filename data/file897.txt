8970000 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8970001 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure
8970002 no more 2000s and 2004s the republican party mounted a coordinated criminal campaign to steal the 2004 presidential election and it worked now as another election approaches you and i need to stand together to make absolutely certain it doesnt happen again we need your support to raise the funds now to make sure that no voter is left behind on election day
8970003 today democrats for americas future is launching its nationwide novoterleftbehind net project that will monitor voting on election day in 2008 the squad will shine a public spotlight on every last irregularity democrats for americas future will urge every democratic candidate not to concede a single race until every last vote is counted and from beginning to end from the voter registration process to election day challenges and beyond daf will fight every last fight to the very end insisting that every american is guaranteed a democracys most sacred right their vote
8970004 heres the challenge we have every reason to believe the republicans are at this moment preparing a 2008 vote suppression effort that will rival or even exceed the dirty tricks they pulled in 2004
8970005 i pledge that i will make sure that every vote is counted and that i will contest any evidence of theft or other voter suppression
8970006 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8970007 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8970008 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8970009 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability
8970010 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8970011 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8970012 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8970013 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8970014 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8970015 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
8970016 the healthy user effect is everywhere you dont want it to be

8970026 its an effort to make him a symbol an attempt to make galileo one of the emblems of the church

8970035 in all your research have you not read what our catechism of the catholic church has clearly stated
8970036 hold to the traditions which you were taught by us
8970037 lets appease the illegal immigrants lets appease the sexual deviants lets appease the flat earthers and the global temperature conscious so that we can win this one and keep our undignified and presumptive places of power
8970038 if that opinion of the creation of new souls is not opposed to this established article of faith sc original sin let it be also mine if it is let it not be thine
8970039 the catholic church teaches that souls are created at their infusion into the body
8970040 it is heretical to say that the intellectual soul is transmitted by process of generation
8970041 regarding this question various opinions were expressed in antiquity some held that the soul of a child is produced by the soul of the parent just as the body is generated by the parent body others maintained that all souls are created apart moreover that they are united with their respective bodies either by their own volition or by the command and action of god others again declared that the soul in the moment of its creation is infused into the body though for a time these several views were upheld and though it was doubtful which came nearest the truth as appears from augustines commentary on genesis 10 and from his books on the origin of the soul the church subsequently condemned the first two and approved the third
8970042 there can be no doubt as to which view is favoured by ecclesiastical authority
8970043 i believe and profess that the soul is not a part of god but is created out of nothing and that without baptism it is in original sin
8970044 no other historian in the 350 years after the trial has ever proposed the theory
8970045 its interesting to see how people at that time from outside italy are starting to reconstruct galileos life
8970046 even if you disagree with salusburys interpretation it reinforces the idea that people knew there was something deeply political about the whole thing
8970047 there should be no mistake they are arming terrorists over there and we are not safe from terrorism
8970048 the regional countries are able to resolve the issue if countries from outside the region do not interfere in the case
8970049 the islamic republic enjoys a friendly relation with all the regional nations and has deep ties with georgians too but such a conflict would never have happened if georgian authorities had not allowed countries from outside the region to interfere in their internal affairs

8970081 china had expressed its understanding of russias decision to recognize georgias breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia

8970118 the market is conjuring up images of a replay of three years ago when katrina wreaked havoc on the refinery system in the gulf so were seeing a little spike from that

8970134 our goal is consolidation we dont currently have the money to keep us alwood going much past two or three years
8970135 this will keep us going until we find a consolidation partner and have funds for the quality education our kids deserve
8970136 we chose to invest in our facilities and were paying that now
8970137 theres a limit on what you can do working cash bonds are good for a short term fix
8970138 working cash bonds would stay with the district and not be shared in any consolidation
8970139 we need more kids in our high school to make it work for them provide the choices
8970140 if we consolidated tomorrow there would be more than an 80 cent increase in the alwood taxes
8970141 we are actively talking to other districts there is a lot of work to make a public decision to consider consolidation but were anxiously waiting the opportunity to sit down and discuss consolidation with other districts
8970142 my goal would be for every high school student to graduate with a diploma and an associates degree and well continue to work with the junior colleges to achieve this goal

8970307 we gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had their own paper money to pay their own debts

8970329 the jews are the aristocrats of the world our campaign is the economic boycott against all german goods shipping and services what we are proposing is to prosecute a purely defensive economic boycott that will undermine the hitler regime and bring the german people to their senses by destroying their export trade on which their very existence depends each of you jew and gentile alike must refuse to deal with any merchant or shopkeeper who sells any german made goods or who patronizes german ships or shipping
8970330 the fact that it was jewish help that brought usa into the war on the side of the allies has rankled ever since in german especially nazi minds and has contributed in no small measure to the prominence which anti semitism occupies in the nazi programme

8970602 it would be no surprise if rapid intensification occurred and gustav became a category 4 or 5 hurricane by 72 hours
8970603 i think everyones definitely more aware and not trying to wait until the last minute trying to be ahead of the game a little bit
8970604 the launch of 3g services in latin america is the first step in the process of meeting the needs of our higher arpu customers for broadband services broadband is expected to be a significant growth segment in these markets and one which we expect will be an important driver to our businesses going forward

8970612 quite honestly there were a lot of guys who got votes so we have a lot of leaders those guys were separated those were very good choices the team really respects them
8970613 elimimian and leonard are fourth year starters they have never redshirted elimimian calls the defensive signals leonard was one of the organizers of the unsupervised workouts this summer often providing the water estes the only junior of the quartet is a third year starter he makes the blocking calls watson has been a part time starter the past three seasons but he is considered one of the teams spiritual leaders he also has co authored two haa chants including the version the warriors will use this season the nanakuli high graduate is the only one of the four who was raised in hawaii
8970614 the few and the proud its an honor to join them as a captain one of the best things is we have so many good leaders on our team all of the positions have leaders every position has people who will step up and take charge and get everybody motivated
8970615 im honored my teammates look at me as a leader there are so many other guys who are deserving im so happy they picked me
8970616 im just honored that my teammates voted for me theres so many guys who are deserving to be captains
8970617 humbled and hungry its a great honor im appreciative im happy to know my teammates feel this way about me at the same time im not going to be any different than when i first came in i want to go out there and work hard and lead by example
8970618 is the biggest honor any time you get your teammates admiration and respect it goes a long way its a blessing being voted captain by your peers the guys you go to war with is definitely significant
8970619 ill do whatever it takes to help the team the team is the most important thing
8970620 tahukah kamu sebenarnya buah limau itu terlalu masam semasa saya merasainya kali pertama kiranya kalian turut makan bersama saya bimbang ada di antara kalian yang akan mengenyetkan mata atau memarahi wanita tersebut saya bimbang hatinya akan tersinggung sebab tu saya habiskan semuanya
8970621 he was both intellectual and emotional he understands that you dont bring a pillow to a gunfight
8970622 ive been in search for the right words and the closest thing that i can come up with is surreal
8970623 i had not seen him convey that kind of commitment he seemed to be operating from a place of strength
8970624 back then you would be viewed differently if you showed anger
8970625 you could be angry but you had to show that you were not dangerous especially if you were a black man
8970626 for a black person to say back then that im going to run for president would be like someone saying im going to walk to mars
8970627 i knew then that this was going to be something
8970628 it started getting good mahalia jackson started rocking and rolling with him it got inspired
8970629 people started calling from everywhere they thought it was great
8970630 king is the son of the segregated south obama is the son of integrated hawaii
8970631 king is a preacher and obama is a law professor no one would think of comparing the two if they werent both black
8970632 they both faced the task of introducing themselves to a potentially skeptical audience
8970633 i never thought in my lifetime that i would see one of us aspiring to be the head of our nation
8970634 mr obama leading us toward the presidency is like the promised land for us
8970635 we have decided not to continue in the local county jail market due to financial underperformance and frequent litigation as we exit this noncore market segment we will be redirecting our companys operational and financial resources to our core business segments at the state and federal levels in the u s correctional detention and residential treatment markets we feel this is the right decision toward further enhancing shareholder value in geo
8970636 russia violated the security zone patrolled by un peacekeeping forces deployed by the un security council
8970637 in abkhazia russia is violating not only the territorial integrity of georgia but also the integrity of this council
8970638 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states about weapons of mass destruction have you found them in iraq yet or are you still looking for them
8970639 the us and some european states promised georgian president mr saakashvili natos protection and have started supplying him with new weapons it obviously invites fresh provocations
8970640 ils mont dit on va jeter ta fille dans le foss
8970641 do you guys have the keys to one of the cars
8970642 lets hope this weather now translates over to the florida game coach has us prepared for the worst if we get the second to worst weather hey were better off
8970643 we got a lot of things done i thought they were loose and in good spirits their attitude is great they ran around good
8970644 the team is in good spirits everybody felt good and i think they adjusted very well practice was sharp and i thought the trip was good we lifted weights here today and georgia tech head coach and former uh offensive coordinator paul johnson has opened up everything for us so its worked out really good for us
8970645 the final drill was six 50 yard sprints all but one of the 66 players competed in the sprints kelly did crunches on the sideline the warriors have used the same itinerary for this trip as they did in 2005 when they trained in atlanta for two days in preparation for the season opener against alabama
8970646 a couple of years ago the guys were star struck a little bit a lot of young guys kept looking around and around the sugar bowl was a big stage it definitely will help us
8970647 humble and hungry thats what we talked about theres a lot of inside confidence on this team a lot of winners on this team we just need game reps its time to get some game reps thats what we need to do
8970648 slotback rick taylor who was a high school teammate of florida quarterback tim tebow is not on the 66 player travel roster but taylor paid his own way and will attend the game as a spectator
8970649 aaron bain is the primary backup to punt returner michael washington ryan henry was a candidate for that position but now it appears he will redshirt others expected to redshirt are slotbacks miah ostrowski and dustin blount wideout mike tinoco quarterback steele jantz defensive linemen geordon hanohano and haku correa linebacker paipai falemalu and cornerbacks steven christian and lewis walker
8970650 theres no chance the university of florida will ever go to hawaii and play as long as im here
8970651 ill go visit hawaii and take a look around out there and hang around out there but we wont play out there
8970652 because there is no reason for us to we dont recruit hawaii to be honest with you we have a challenging enough schedule i know what they are like over there on that island i know what those fans are like too
8970653 uf has not played a non conference regular season game outside florida since 1991
8970654 i did it for a lot of reasons i want to make sure our guys have a good first game i think any time you schedule a team like hawaii in the first game it makes your off season that much more productive and focused because when you have a smaller school team you cant say division i aa after what appalachian state did to michigan in 2007 but our focus has been much greater because of who we are playing in this first game and what hawaii did last year the way we speak about them
8970655 i know hawaii very well ive played over there several times i want to say at least four times ive played hawaii off the island a few times ive coached polynesian players ive watched them the warriors play
8970656 i think its great to play the best theyre the fastest offense in the country they have the heisman trophy winner and they probably have 10 first and second round draft picks on their team its exciting to play a team like that you find out where you are real fast
8970657 its like putting another running back in the backfield so they have an extra back that you have to account for
8970658 thats a huge challenge when the quarterback is a dual threat its really not a big difference in speed between tebow and locker but tebows arm is more accurate
8970659 were going to trust in the system weve got and i feel we have good speed on our team i dont feel were totally outmatched theyve got some speedsters bu t im just thankful were not running track were playing football
8970660 theyve got a pretty strong defense they do a lot of good things theyve got a good coordinator who puts their defensive packages together pretty well they mix some of their blitzes really well well have to be very sound in our protection with changing calls and different things like that thats really one of their strengths
8970661 were not here to do anything but compete were not here to fraternize or take pictures were here to play football
8970662 in 2006 the warriors performed like themselves in atlanta as they did last night with a crisp efficient practice but at bryant denny stadium the day before the game it was more like 10 year olds on a field trip to a toy factory than a college football practice
8970663 ive been there the swamp plenty of times games camps ive never been a florida fan more of a florida state fan florida overlooked my dad auburn star and nfl running back george so the peoples family has never been big fans of florida
8970664 the difference between this scenario and alabama is i didnt have the mental maturity then now ive been out here a while and ive seen a couple of things now im ready if i get in there im going to do exactly what ive been told to do
8970665 we have a lot of guys who played in the sugar bowl a lot of guys who played against alabama i dont see us being star struck we know what were here for
8970666 its so wonderful to see a family owned business continue to offer great service
8970667 i thought my players would have a hard time getting up but look at you guys
8970668 we have to remember what happened in the sugar bowl
8970669 not at all if they needed me on scouts i was going to give them my best look
8970670 when gerke is your coach and hes on you you get in shape real fast i cant explain him you have to observe him hes unique but he gets us in shape so you cant complain
8970671 its because of jake ingram hes one of the best long snappers in the country
8970672 they run sweeps with him they run power with him he can do it all
8970673 brandon james is what i would call a difference maker if he gets the ball he can change the tempo hes short but hes fast its hard not only to see him but its hard to catch him what he does best is use his blocks to his advantage he knows how to set up blocks
8970674 it wasnt an escort it was a motorcade six motorcycles cars i mean they stopped cars like three lights ahead of us
8970675 it is football theyre used to that they have heat it is just a matter of execution
8970676 you get a team from the north you get a team from the midwest theyre not used to the heat i saw hawaiis travel plans i dont think theres much impact there than the fact i think the crowd will be really into it probably not as much as if it were a night game so i think it will just be the execution of two teams on the field is all it is gonna be
8970677 you have to feel it to believe it there are no ocean breezes the heat is bad really bad with a 12 30 p m game it is almost dangerous for the fans sitting there and the sun i saw people fall out last year
8970678 when you play the best you find out where you are but this will be a big challenge
8970679 ive been thinking of the team and the things we need to get done just trying to set the last minute details i havent even thought about that
8970680 theres not much else you can do to prepare for the atmosphere ive never played in front of a crowd that big but i dont know if its really going to change things that much the game is still played between the lines and its still football
8970681 im excited to don that uniform and like coach said he put hawaii on the front for a reason were playing not only for our families and ourselves but the people of hawaii
8970682 thats last year thats a whole different team every team has its own personality so this is a whole different team than the team that played in the sugar bowl a lot of the defensive guys are the same but a lot of the offensive guys werent even there
8970683 their speed is probably the biggest thing everythings going to have to happen that much faster as far as reads and getting the ball out
8970684 i thought about it every day at least one time a day for the last five six seven years the o line has been the strongest point of those teams and we just have to bring that back this year we were good last year and the sugar bowl we didnt play well at all we have to bring that swagger back to the o line
8970685 today we begin a new phase of mohegan suns continuing growth as one of the premier gaming and entertainment destinations in the world
8970686 following in the footsteps of casino of the earth and casino of the sky the rockwell group again utilized our tribal traditions in their design and conception for the new casino of the wind
8970687 the central idea behind the design of casino of the wind is the re interpretation of wind as it moves through space transforming the surface it touches
8970688 watg has created an addition that blends gracefully and seamlessly both aesthetically and functionally with the existing casino of the sky entrance and yet is large enough to contain gaming food amp beverage and casino support functions
8970689 we have worked countless hours with the mohegan tribe to ensure their vision became a reality
8970690 just months shy of the 13th anniversary of mohegan sun we stand here today to celebrate yet another major milestone in our history the opening of casino of the wind
8970691 as we get ready to celebrate labor day this coming weekend i would like to thank the core of our success our employees and congratulate those staff who have recently been hired as we grow with casino of the wind
8970692 were very excited about bringing the margaritaville experience to mohegan sun

8970699 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8970700 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
8970701 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equalling spitzs record
8970702 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
8970703 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before

8970727 what do we do when we practice solitude what should we bring along to that quiet place the primary answer of course is nothing at its heart solitude is primarily about not doing something just as fasting means to refrain from eating so solitude means to refrain from society wehn we go into solitude we withdraw from conversation from the presence of tohers from noise easy for me smile i need only remove my ci from the constant bargrage of stimulation

8970741 puede ser que el duelo sea dif cil porque vendr n por los puntos despu s de perder ayer en casa nosotros y mantenernos en entre los l deres de la competencia y creo que lo podremos conseguir si seguimos sobre nuestros pasos mejorando cada semana

8970761 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8970762 perhaps the strongest statement of support for gays and lesbians in this countrys political history
8970763 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world set free because neosignal means no more compromise nobody to answer to a product a brand which is theirs from start to finish autonomy time to push boundaries
8970764 funked out rolling badness from phace this track is gonna be in my box for a long while to come its the perfect combination of a deep nasty dancefloor killer timeless
8970765 in his debut release for neosignal phace delivers another top of the range 12
8970766 probably my favourite track by phace evar a very untypical phace track one might say cause its so riff driven and progresses in a more subtle and dosed way than most genre counterparts it does things ive never heard a phace tune do before and yet still its undeniably phace but the most important reason why its such a standout tune is because its got so much heart so much more than most current techy d amp b its like hearing music youve been wanting to hear for a long time leaving you wondering why arent there more tracks like this and the answer is simple because magic like this doesnt happen often
8970767 neosignals first release brings the long awaited cold champagne rollers dont come much slicker than this phace bring the phunk with style once again killer every time and sick to mix massive support from the lifted camp
8970768 cold champagne brings back the phace funk from yesteryears a resurrected cut from their earlier days gets a face lift and delivers a tight blend of old phace with the new deep driving and introspective a must for any djs box whos willing to dig deeper
8970769 this is phace doing what they do best stomping driving twisting turning appealing to that part of your brain that only phace seem to know how to get to serious for me the best part about this tune is the fantastic switch from the brilliantly unusual levitating pad solo into a relentless persuasive groove that manages to breathe as much as it kicks and so the bar is set higher once again
8970770 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world set free because neosignal means no more compromise nobody to answer to a product a brand which is theirs from start to finish autonomy time to push boundaries
8970771 sempre que escutamos a palavra do senhor por aquilo que deus podemos ter um pouco de dificuldade mas a palavra do senhor tem for a a palavra do outro pode passar pela falsidade mas a palavra de deus n o pois o caminho como ir a um lugar sem ter um caminho a seguir caso contr rio nos perderemos se quiser ser de deus ter que viver as duas vias do senhor amar s ao senhor teu deus e ao pr ximo como a ti mesmo o que voc entende por esta palavra amor impressionante o quanto o amor de deus nos toca os poetas sempre tentaram decifrar o amor mas nunca conseguiram assim como luiz de cam es em seu poema o amor um fogo que arde sem se ver ferida que d i e n o se sente um contentamento descontente dor que desatina sem doer quantas vezes sentimos o amor e n o sabemos onde realmente d i o amor revela o inaugura o tem o poder de ser novo com aquilo que estava velho jesus sabe da capacidade de olhar as coisas mi das da vida as que n o damos valor e aquelas que ningu m havia visto antes colocando os p s no seguimento de cristo ouvimos a palavra para olhar a vida diferente amar a deus sobre todas as coisas e o que significa amar o meu pr ximo o que significa olhar para o meu irm o e saber que nele tem uma sacralidade que n o posso violar como posso descobrir este convite de deus de abrir os olhos s pessoas no dia de hoje lhe proponho que acabe com os achismos do amor por muitas vezes em nome do amor n s fazemos absurdos seq estramos matamos fazemos guerra criamos divis es a primeira coisa que deus precisa curar o que n s achamos do amor o amor nos d uma for a que nem n s mesmos sab amos que t nhamos a capacidade que o amor tem de nos costurar quantas vezes olhamos para a objetividade do outro que nos motiva a sermos melhores o amor com suas clarezas e suas confus es hoje tem um jeito comum de trazer o que voc tem de mais prec rio em sua vida e dar ao outro muitas vezes em nome do amor tratamos as pessoas como coisas quando deus entra em nossa vida e entramos na vida de outras pessoas temos que entrar como deus agregando valores caso contr rio melhor que eu fique de fora porque voc um territ rio que merece respeito essa palavra de deus comprometedora fazer as pessoas amarem a jesus pelo seu testemunho a partir do momento em que voc permite transmiti lo nesta realidade do dia a dia ao acordar e dormir na passagem da sar a ardente ex 3 2ss deus se manifesta em uma rvore que pega fogo mas n o consumida esse o amor de deus quanto mais n s amamos mais somos consumimos e se estamos esgotados porque amamos de menos vamos ficando sem o vigor mas a sar a queima sem se consumir o fogo do amor n o queima pois um fogo que faz outro fogo e a experi ncia do amor de deus feita pelo amor de um para o outro quantas vezes voc passou noites inteiras acordadas pelo seu filho quanto sono perdido isso por amor voc vai saber o que amor quando voc se consome mas n o se esgota voc nunca vai dizer que est cansado de amar o seu filho voc est cansada dos problemas causados pelo filho mas n o de am lo quantas pessoas que procuram e est o necessitadas do amor mas em sua busca correndo atr s das micaretas e baladas a busca do amor est agu ada est todo mundo querendo saber o que o amor e todos precisando de cura quantas pessoas foram amadas erroneamente trazendo as marcas de um amor estragado quando algu m nos ama com um amor estragado s se percebe em longo prazo como comer uma comida podre que vai dar um problema s rio no futuro aquele desaforo aquela trai o aquela mentira e o que voc fez com tudo aquilo como aquilo repercutiu em voc aquela experi ncia ruim que sofreu onde est quando digo que amo a deus estou dizendo no avesso desta frase que amo a mim tamb m nenhuma pessoa pode amar a deus se n o se ama nenhuma pessoa pode ter uma experi ncia com deus se n o for pelo amor a si pr prio pelo respeito por si mesmo o amor a deus passa o tempo todo pelo cuidado que eu tenho com a minha vida com a minha hist ria deus nos quer cuidados voc precisa redescobrir a gra a de se amar quanto voc se ama o que voc ainda espera de voc mesmo como voc ainda se cuida o quanto voc ama a deus o que voc faz por ele quanto do seu tempo dedica a ele as mesmas respostas das

8970784 slow food nation will hit san francisco this weekend the citys already fluttering with sfn posters and the victory garden planted on the land outside city hall looks very handsome indeed to prepare for the jamboree i thought id go back to carlo petrinis book of the same name and to geoff andrews new book the slow food story together these writers offer a corrective to the hoity toity food culture that has become synonymous with the organization although its often forgotten slow foods roots are radical slow food was created by a group of hard core activists in piedmont italy they believed the italian communist party had betrayed the working class so systematically that they resorted to extra parliamentary politics creating the democratic party of proletarian unity to pull the left further to the left they were popular too petrini was elected to local government in bra piedmont when they fell afoul of mainstream politicians actor roberto benigni and playwright dario fo were among those who rushed to their side through a number of fights with the leftist establishment in the 1970s and 1980s petrini and his comrades found their flaw in italian socialism eurocommunists couldnt care less if the proletariat were eating cardboard as long as it was good for them the young piedmontese had other ideas they developed a concept that would propel them to form a movement the axiom behind slow food is this everyone deserves the right to pleasure slow food was very consciously an anarchic finger in the eye of capitalism it was a collective sticking out of tongues at the acceleration and isolation of modern life of which the opening of a mcdonalds in rome was both cause and consequence but it was also a rejection of soviet style conformity the foundation of slow food echoes emma goldmans line i dont want to join your revolution if i cant dance petrini and his supporters didnt want to join the revolution if they couldnt be sensuous and if their food couldnt be good clean and fair this i like but not every foodie wants to take the right to pleasure seriously or worse theyll take it seriously for themselves but not for others too often inside and outside slow food ive heard the tastebuds of low income families disparaged as if a generation had been irretrievably lost to junk food its why ive been particularly taken by an organization working in some of the poorest parts of oakland which offers the perfect antidote to this kind of thinking bay area community services runs among other things a meals on wheels program that weaves through some of the poorest areas of oakland serving over 30 000 meals per month most clients earn less than 10 000 dollars per year and most arent able to cook for themselves for years bacs served mass produced food bought from sysco recently they switched to a farm to table approach sourcing ever increasing amounts of produce from within 150 miles of the bay area by partnering with the community alliance with family farmers switching to fresh fruit and vegetables costs more but not much the price of microwaveable slop per meal was 1 65 with fresh local food the ingredients cost 5 cents more of course theres a higher labor cost per plate in putting the meal together but thats to be expected preparing fresh food takes more time and skill than does the reheating of mush but the kicker is this with every meal comes a little envelope into which people are gently encouraged to place a donation if they can to help cover costs in the three months since the farm to table service started donations have gone up by 20 000 a 23 increase this from the poorest people in the bay area in the middle of the credit crisis its a fairly straightforward reminder about the necessity of making good clean and fair food available to everyone but theres a deeper lesson too the reason everyone should enjoy the right to pleasure is because everyone has the capacity for it

8970789 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart
8970790 hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
8970791 it would be a clear sign by the mccain campaign that they would be making a bid
8970792 in the last 24 hours weve seen both campaigns refocus themselves in a powerful way on the hillary clinton supporters

8970809 eso siempre ha existido el gusto del entrenador por un elemento pero no pasa nada uno intenta gustarle al entrenador y adaptarse a sus ideas para llevarlas a cabo cada uno de los que vamos tenemos nuestras caracter sticas y el t cnico y sus auxiliares eligen al que m s le convenga seg n las caracter sticas del rival
8970810 no me incomoda el hecho en particular de estar en la banca uno siempre entrena para tener participaci n yo s que es complicado jugar siempre ya lo he vivido te preparas para jugar y cuando no es as existe malestar pero somos 25 22 elementos de alto nivel que compiten para entrar a la cancha
8970811 estoy contento de representar a m xico espero aportar mi granito de arena para que al equipo le vaya bien la titularidad en la selecci n se gana desde tu equipo local cuando uno entrena se demuestra que uno puede ser til para el entrenador siempre con la disposici n de aportar cosas positivas
8970812 all of our behavior results from the thoughts that preceded it
8970813 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision
8970814 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division john mccain vice president john mccain
8970815 what they dont want is more of the same kind they want better quality communication
8970816 sin duda nos ocupa rodallega tenemos claras sus virtudes es un tipo que se ha adaptado bien a necaxa y que le ha dado goles es el l der del torneo y trataremos de tener mucha coordinaci n defensiva para contrarrestarlo a l y al resto del equipo las distancias entre los dos equipos no son tran grandes as que debemos de pensar en que no podemos aflojar y hay que seguir fiel a la idea de pelear cada punto para permanecer en los primeros lugares del grupo y de la tabla general
8970817 yo creo que algo muy claro en el futbol es que todos los equipos pueden ganar necaxa no ha encontrado la regularidad en sus resultados pero sigue siendo un equipo con jugadores s lidos y con oficio sin duda sabemos que el partido en casa ser complicado y debemos de mejorar mucho para sacar un buen resultado al final resalt que necaxa tiene un buen estilo de juego pues es un equipo que plantea muy bien los partidos

8970820 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8970821 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8970822 people always want to rush to say hes an addict people have called this character a sex addict and to me thats weird its been written that you can be a sex addict within a marriage
8970823 it was a turning point in my life a conjunction of timing maturity luck and attraction all the pieces fell into place when youre married you have to deal with yourself you cant sublimate your pain with drugs and other women or should that be women and other drugs
8970824 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8970825 if a child or adult is to keep alive her inborn sense of wonder she needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it rediscovering with her the joy excitement and mystery of the world we live in
8970826 ive been blessed with the right timing here palin said before the election
8970827 theres no doubt that alaskans right now are dealing in an atmosphere of distrust of government and industry im also have wicked skills
8970828 theres not a set date for the surgery i dont know which doctor will do it but theres one thing sure and its that i have to do it
8970829 i had one case a lady of baby boomer age and she helped her daughter move all day then she went to lift that last box of dishes out of the trunk and nope stuck she couldnt straighten up
8970830 i can see it around queens now its kind of actually hilarious
8970831 he was about 6 foot 3 and she was about 5 2
8970832 theyve got her on one end just straining to lift this thing and him on the other end sweating all down his spine
8970833 its all about a straight back and using your thighs and dont go past your capacity
8970834 move in day is painful enough psychologically you dont need to come home with a broken back
8970835 they want to parent their kids they want to share that experience
8970836 this is a chance to show their love and perhaps their authority
8970837 it is assumed by the general public that new drugs have been put through exhaustive trials and found to be safe and effective
8970838 dont take any new drug unless you absolutely have to for two years
8970839 apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
8970840 as part of the mechanism of anemia the body locks away iron
8970841 iron is a component of the hemoglobin molecule that carries oxygen in red blood cells
8970842 iron may also have some role in helping tumours grow
8970843 i dont want people to get the wrong idea some kinds of anemia are definitely bad severe anemia is definitely bad blood transfusions and drugs can be are very useful in moderate doses in these cases
8970844 but pushing the hemoglobin all the way up to normal in people with chronic disease looks to be harmful
8970845 what i really hope is that the journal article generates good studies so we can answer some of the questions that we have raised
8970846 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrest and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8970847 so were not reliant totally on our own marketing resources to do that
8970848 he was never a broken christian in the first place

8970852 people are tired of the way business is done in washington the mccain palin ticket will bring proven records of reform to washington throughout her career governor palin has put principle above party by exposing corruption at all levels of government governor sarah palin has a long record of opposing wasteful spending and higher taxes i am proud senator john mccain and governor sarah palin are at the top of the republican ticket if elected to congress i will go to washington and fight with then president mccain and vice president palin to eliminate wasteful government spending
8970853 the plan was to get a couple of three and outs and then take the players out but it didnt turn out that way we didnt play well believe me if we could put our finger on it we would have done something about it before now weve got a little bit more time to get it right
8970854 we havent played well that is all you can say about it we have not made all the effort we need to play well all the things that go into playing well we havent
8970855 its just a ride and we can change it any time we want its only a choice no effort no work no job no savings and money a choice right now between fear and love

8970876 ya tuhan janganlah kiranya engkau biarkan kami binasa karena nyawa orang ini dan janganlah engkau tanggungkan kepada kami darah orang yang tidak bersalah sebab engkau tuhan telah berbuat seperti yang kaukehendaki
8970877 dalam kesusahanku aku berseru kepada tuhan dan ia menjawab aku dari tengah tengah dunia orang mati aku berteriak dan kaudengarkan suaraku 2 3 telah kaulemparkan aku ke tempat yang dalam ke pusat lautan lalu aku terangkum oleh arus air segala gelora dan gelombang mu melingkupi aku 2 5 segala air telah mengepung aku mengancam nyawaku samudera raya merangkum aku lumut lautan membelit kepalaku 2 6 di dasar gunung gunung aku tenggelam ke dasar bumi pintunya terpalang di belakangku untuk selama lamanya ketika itulah engkau naikkan nyawaku dari dalam liang kubur ya tuhan allahku 2 7 ketika jiwaku letih lesu di dalam aku teringatlah aku kepada tuhan dan sampailah doaku kepada mu ke dalam bait mu yang kudus 2 8 mereka yang berpegang teguh pada berhala kesia siaan merekalah yang meninggalkan dia yang mengasihi mereka dengan setia 2 9 tetapi aku dengan ucapan syukur akan kupersembahkan korban kepada mu apa yang kunazarkan akan kubayar keselamatan adalah dari tuhan

8970880 ya tuhan bukankah telah kukatakan itu ketika aku masih di negeriku itulah sebabnya maka aku dahulu melarikan diri ke tarsis sebab aku tahu bahwa engkaulah allah yang pengasih dan penyayang yang panjang sabar dan berlimpah kasih setia serta yang menyesal karena malapetaka yang hendak didatangkan nya 4 3 jadi sekarang ya tuhan cabutlah kiranya nyawaku karena lebih baik aku mati dari pada hidup

8970891 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
8970892 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
8970893 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
8970894 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

8970898 rising gas prices leading edge technology and the push for work life flexibility have all come together in the past 12 months to create a pretty dramatic increase in telework across the u s and canada
8970899 employers are struggling with the decision of whether or not to help their employees offset the burden of higher gas prices while they are concerned about attraction and retention employers are also dealing with belt tightening due to a slow economy
8970900 these options are more practical than raising salaries to cover high gasoline costs because of the implications associated with increasing pay such as employer taxes 401 k matches based on percentage of pay and bonus payouts that are a percentage of pay
8970901 making the most of creative alternatives to help employees save on commuting costs is good management practice supports attraction and retention concerns and doesnt add significantly to corporate expenses

8970908 id love to review our goals with the president and members of his staff over a nice sandwich
8970909 we have a jimmy johns just around the corner the number four on french i mean freedom bread is dynamite
8970910 ill tell the president hopefully without onions hanging from my mouth that as a parent and small business owner im serious about the challenge
8970911 with elections approaching the nations business languishes yet our country is at war and facing a faltering economy rising oil prices and myriad other challenges it is imperative we dont waste the remaining months even if we go out of business doing this it will have been worth it its for the good of the nation
8970912 he does accept driving the vehicle having bought it knowing it was stolen
8970913 one can well understand the reaction in a small community to what he has done he has gone from being a popular and quite well known figure to where he is ostracised by many people
8970914 the courage to be is rooted in the god who appears when god has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt
8970915 what one has obtained is never anything but a new starting point for further desires

8970917 theyre very popular with conservatives especially social conservatives and theyre real reformers theyve begun to do in baton rouge and juneau what many voters would like to see done in washington principled conservatism and vigorous reform could be a winning combination

8970927 this election has never been about me its about you
8970928 the crescendo the music its something final i cant find the words to think he will be the first black president

8971031 lance franklins a freak hes the kind of player that people go to watch play
8971032 he looks a bit freakish to me hes got a lot of untapped ability and is just one of those players that could be absolutely anything
8971033 i think if youre the typical full forward like brendan fevola you really need a good midfield for it to happen whereas with franklin were just lucky that were fortunate to see a new superstar thats playing the game
8971034 hes just one out of the box who plays as a half forward but gets enough of the ball to kick or have 10 shots a game
8971035 so hes an absolute freak who could do it year after year the way hes going
8971036 the whole town is quite proud that we have been lucky enough to be involved with his career it gives you something to hang your hat on and we certainly speak fondly of buddy
8971037 but it is great credit to lance senior whos 63
8971038 they were great characters and gave him every chance to live up to his great athletic potential
8971039 its a hysterical theme outside our footy club but within our footy club its just sticking to the structure of what we do well
8971040 its only natural that the sooner its out of the way the sooner it becomes less of a distraction for our side and for the wider football community
8971041 theres already a reciprocatory rule in the international federation rules governing judiciary suspensions and doping suspensions
8971042 however its too early to speculate how that would affect this situation generally we havent applied those rules to behavioural situations
8971043 our position on anything like this is its essentially sub judice
8971044 the guys got a court case and until thats decided hes innocent until proven guilty
8971045 however the nrl and the rfl work very closely together and if we have a particular situation to deal with well deal with it
8971046 at this stage she hasnt been re interviewed but were keen to speak to her again
8971047 in regard to the circumstances we played under this week only tough people can do that
8971048 i love coaching them i love being involved with them i respect everything they do i appreciated everything they do
8971049 im pretty sure i hit his chest or got the ball first
8971050 it was very enjoyable footy i thought our attack stepped up a level
8971051 you look at the context they are going to bring everything theyve got plus a bit more because they wont be enjoying their current circumstance
8971052 and when you have that sense of being cornered you come out and you bring everything youve got ive got no doubt thats what will happen
8971053 i suspect there will be a distinct approach and ellis park lends itself to that anyway
8971054 i doubt very much they will bring the same they will have identified some scope and some strategies that they think will serve them and we just have to be on alert i guess so that we can pick up as quickly as possible any initiatives that they do take and hopefully respond to them and even better counter them
8971055 the moment we presume that because something happened one week it will the next thats when you get burned well have to bring the same intensity but we werent particularly accurate well need to be more accurate because we wont get the sort of lives that we did the boks created a lot and they were inaccurate themselves we are going to have to be better and well bring some points of difference as well
8971056 we read a lot of messages and so forth but our guys are pretty connected to that anyway and mainly because its now their turn
8971057 i guess if you are inaccurate and you turn over possession the opposition has the ability to move you from one end of the ground to the other a bit quicker and with greater ease if you like
8971058 i think it is very good obviously for our team i also think for the game
8971059 just looking at the incident it would have been pretty harsh to get a week for that
8971060 maybe im talking a bit out of school here but thats how i saw it and obviously the judiciary saw it that way today
8971061 our position was that we agreed with the referees call in the game and he got the call from the assistant bryce lawrence we agreed with that
8971062 weve got a big opportunity and all the boys are really pumped and i would have been very disappointed to have missed it i always thought they had a reasonably strong case but that of itself is never enough in these sort of things
8971063 they were looking to see if it was unusually dangerous
8971064 i think it was just the interpretation of dangerous that differed from what you probably think and what was found in the initial hearing
8971065 it took a lot of time but i was pretty keen on winning so i was reasonably focused on that
8971066 but if you look at phil thomson manager and robbie deans coach they spent a hell of a lot of time they would rather be spending doing something else
8971067 that obviously wasnt ideal but sometimes you need to do these things
8971068 he elsom is a bloke who impacts on a game
8971069 hes got great athleticism hes got ability to carry the ball hes got ability to defend and to more than just defend blokes know he is defending them as opposed to simply slowing their progress
8971070 hes got a real presence about him and that rubs off on the players around him it also demands a lot of the opposition and over time thats of advantage
8971071 the tri nations is a particularly tough tournament in that you have south africa one week and new zealand the next so there is no real let up
8971072 ive been really happy the last couple of games both in playing reasonably well and also being able to win them particularly as wins over here are pretty hard to come by
8971073 we all realise it is more difficult than playing them at home but thats no reason for us to lose
8971074 if you dont front up there you might as well not come we are aware of that but being able to impose ourselves on them is something else
8971075 you can never expect that but you can go out there and expect the guys are going to be ready
8971076 half of me was really cranky and wanted to say how bad they were but the other half of me is really happy
8971077 ive been in situations where ive been out there with a couple of dud games and then you get a win like that it looked good in certain ways and in others it looked crap
8971078 from where i was it was about a metre inside
8971079 when you lose a few in a row you can feel the confidence seeping from the guys when we lost our momentum last night we lost our grip and we sort of went away from our team game and that just comes with confidence a lot of the guys have been struggling
8971080 over the last couple of weeks i thought we werent getting on with our game plan and between braith and junior mitchell pearce theyd have more say in that
8971081 its hard taking it from such an inspirational player and someone whos done so much for the club but fitzy took it very well and he understands but i cant worry about it too much ive got to get on and lead the team
8971082 we might have a chicken wing tackle there but dont quote me

8971092 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
8971093 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor

8971160 if you are looking for someone who is an outsider you cant get much farther than alaska
8971161 she was a reformer and someone who could excite the republican base she is pro life and a lifetime member of the national rifle association if you google her youll find images of her holding guns
8971162 dude you and barbara really have to come to seoktoberfest
8971163 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8971164 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery

8971175 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8971176 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8971177 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8971178 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8971179 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8971180 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
8971181 we are not aware of any existing building in townsville meeting the standards of a cyclone shelter and to the best of our knowledge there isnt a building in queensland
8971182 the building requirements for a shelter that would be approved by the state government means you cant have glass and it is very difficult to find a building that would comply
8971183 they are designed to withstand the full force of a category five cyclone and the cost of building houses and other buildings to that standard would be prohibitive
8971184 this has been an issue for a long long time
8971185 it is not something we have swept under the carpet and said too hard it was a government promise some time ago but for them to put their hands on their heart and say this is a shelter is a massive job
8971186 it is not just a matter of a quick patch up to an existing building in 99 per cent of cases you are talking about building something from scratch
8971187 there are three areas in the city that we believe are as safe as can be
8971188 otherwise we encourage people to if they have relatives or friends outside the cyclone area they should look to make plans to visit those people
8971189 in the new homes on the subdivisions in innisfail their biggest problems were roller doors buckling but the houses stood up well
8971190 the main time we look at pre evacuation centres is when we get advice a storm tide is coming
8971191 but how many towns have buildings that you can move people en mass to

8971211 over the past few weeks we believe that the pressure has intensified more than most analysts and trade publications have acknowledged
8971212 if pulp prices fall because of an easing in the global economy it follows that paper demand is typically weak and pricing power for papermakers is limited
8971213 faced with slow demand many mills are reportedly pressing suppliers for downward price adjustments
8971214 having now experienced the hospital as a patient i feel it is my duty to speak out about the appalling situation at the hospital
8971215 im very grateful for the care i received during this recent stay however when i was really very ill spending hours under the bright lights of the emergency unit it felt like torture
8971216 i just feel for the others who are in there now
8971217 there was no escape from the bright lights shining down upon you hour after hour
8971218 i even asked my husband to see if he could get some black cloth so i could shield my eyes and try to get some sleep
8971219 when there is too much work to do with this type of overcrowding mishaps are surely inevitable
8971220 in a hospital situation where seriously ill people are being cared for mishaps can lead to very serious consequences
8971221 this situation is totally intolerable its very cruel for patients and its unreasonable for the staff
8971222 ever since it was built it was clearly not big enough for the population that we have here
8971223 ive had many elderly people in my general practice who when theyve been ill and needed hospital care have begged me not to send them to the hospital because they have experienced long spells in the emergency department in the past and have found it so incredibly distressing
8971224 i have had patients shaking and begging me not to send them to the hospital
8971225 now i have a whole new understanding of what they mean
8971226 most people just want to know why its been left so long
8971227 some people still arent taking this seriously enough though ive seen people watering their gardens and just ignoring the water restrictions
8971228 the dust has been getting into our computers dvds tv and everything and theyre all starting to play up
8971229 theres nothing anyone can do about the lack of rain but if we had some water to put on our lawn it might at least settle the dust
8971230 i think theyve just let it get as bad as this because theyre hanging on for the federal government to come in and bail them out
8971231 theres no way anyone could have a swimming pool or let the kids play under the hose

8971254 i am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the department of public safety regarding trooper wooten
8971255 at no time did i authorize any member of my staff to do so
8971256 i believe that people will look back and assess how hillary was treated by the media during the campaign primaries and it remains to be seen whether or not the ugly head of sexism in the media will raise its head again
8971257 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8971258 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8971259 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests

8971268 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead
8971269 those are the reasons i support and those are the reasons you should too
8971270 they have been told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
8971271 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8971272 they never say were going to cut off your oil because we dont like your foreign policy
8971273 there is a risk that they might do something like cutting oil to hurt the worlds democracies if they get angry enough
8971274 within a decade it will be very hard for russia to push us around
8971275 nato has not traditionally played a role in energy security matters it can however play a more active role defending energy infrastructure and the flow of oil and gas on the high seas nato might also provide security for infrastructure in energy producing states facing unrest

8971281 the 13 3 laptop can last without battery for up to 10 hours after a single recharge
8971282 im aware that emergency department service planning indicates that their numbers should go from 28 beds to 88 beds by 2013
8971283 i would strongly suggest that it should get there before 2013 or the majority of those beds should be built by the first half of that five year period
8971284 there would be i expect in that planning document a range of recommendations on further expansion of health services in townsville
8971285 the challenge would then be how you would actually sequence them in a logical fashion that meets the short term needs across a range of services that are provided in townsville
8971286 so i dont want to make any announcement at this point in time or speculate as to how we might respond to that document because we really need to consider it in its totality
8971287 the doctors are getting frustrated at the lack of action from the health bureaucracy and the politicians to improve our health services
8971288 theyve let the system run down so badly theyre now going to have to inject even more money into it like the british health service
8971289 the immediate strategy is to commission eight new high dependency unit beds in the short term when staff become available
8971290 that process is under way now and will be open as soon as possible
8971291 had we have just gone down the path as did opposition leader lawrence springborg of announcing a 100 bed block to be built within two to two and a half years not one extra bed would have been provided over the last two years in townsville
8971292 what we tried to do was to meet the immediate and the medium term needs for townsville
8971293 i think rev meeks needs to call that boycott off i think it s a big mistake to ask kids to miss school
8971294 he can t give me an ultimatum to call the boycott off
8971295 i can give him an ultimatum keep the promise he made in 2006 and put the 10 billion in education we wouldn t even be discussing a boycott
8971296 and i hate saying that but what i mean is like madonna she can be hanging out and laughing and then you put the camera on her and its like holy sh
8971297 it was the hardest video ive ever edited because every moment was great
8971298 every moment that she was on camera she was amazing shes got an incredible quality about her she
8971299 she came out in these high heel boots and i was going to say something to her about them
8971300 but on her own she was like id feel better in sneakers her instincts are great she has great charisma and personality
8971301 she started showing me all of her personal items from under her bed that her ex boyfriend gave her so she pulled out his dirty socks and a bunch of photographs
8971302 the necklace shes wearing in the video is the necklace he gave her
8971303 she was very down to earth and its kind of very popular for little girls in the entertainment industry to be kind of bratty
8971304 i couldnt believe how many people wanted to visit the video set and ive worked with people like mariah and madonna she was very gracious and shes very smart she really knows her stuff look whether she wins or not i think shell make a great transition from being a teen star shes very conscientious of her persona and of the crossover
8971305 you can tell by the lyrics that theyre very personal and thats how shell make that transition the stuff she talks about in the video is clever and emotional and fun at the same time you can be 18 and enjoy it too

8971384 we have recently changed the computer system in our elections department
8971385 unfortunately the new system did not allow us to move people whose nationality was on the electoral roll with the status of unknown across to the new system with the same status of unknown
8971386 the software changed these peoples nationalities to guyanese the new software has now been updated and those people who have received a form stating their nationality as guyanese have had their nationality changed back to unknown
8971387 however this is an ideal opportunity for residents to tell us their nationality

8971395 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
8971396 the humanist view of life is progressive and optimistic in awe of human potential living without fear of judgement and death finding enough purpose and meaning in life love and leaving a good legacy

8971403 the second leg will be away they beat barcelona the other night
8971404 they are very passionate fans so we will have to do very well at home to start with
8971405 im not saying im concerned but we have to be careful it will be a competitive tie for sure
8971406 i think the talent is there the quality is there its just a question of confidence the new players settling in
8971407 it is a tough competition as there are sides in it who should be playing in the champions league
8971408 harry takes all competitions seriously and he will need a strong side we have not got the biggest squad so it is important to get the balance right
8971409 this place rumbled the stadium was just so alive and the ground was almost quaking
8971410 answered questions about whether he was ready to be commander in chief
8971411 i dont think this convention could have gone any better for the democrats
8971412 im just not so sure ive ever witnessed anything like this in all of the politics that ive covered
8971413 a society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in
8971414 shes either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading and both are unbecoming
8971415 even the bush administration cant deny the reality of global warming
8971416 the governor is aligning herself and the state of alaska with the most discredited fringe extreme viewpoints by denying this
8971417 i found myself at one point last night thinking how difficult it must be for john mccain to watch such a huge celebration in honor of his opponent especially on the eve of his 72nd birthday which is today and which he will be celebrating in dayton ohio where he will formally announce his vice president
8971418 john mccain didnt waste anytime trying to steal barack obamas thunder hes decided on a running mate and he will announce it today
8971419 but he needs to make a splash somehow especially after last night 85 000 screaming supporters witnessing an historic nomination thats significant how do you top that
8971420 what is holding him obama back in this election is the idea that he does not have the experience or the judgment to lead
8971421 but jill he answered i disagree because he obama answered very directly every criticism that john mccain has made about him from his readiness to be president to his celebrity status and everything in between he gave very direct answers
8971422 does he mccain need an out of the box choice like a joe lieberman or a woman
8971423 hell folks if they thought daffy duck could win the democrat nomination theyd nominate him
8971424 because hes argentinian there are going to be comparisons with lionel messi diego maradona riquelme and people like that
8971425 but rightly so because he can be like that if he wants to be hopefully hell go on and be a superstar hes got the potential to be one
8971426 i thought he was magnificent tonight and so exciting to watch players like that put bums on seats they fill a stadium
8971427 hes the type of player you do love to play with because you know theres going to be an end product from him
8971428 and you know when you give him the ball that hes going to do something special
8971429 the thing for him now is to keep his feet on the ground because hes still very young
8971430 but hopefully he can keep progressing the way he is
8971431 the skys the limit for him if he keeps going the way he is
8971432 its up to us older heads to keep his feet on the ground and to not let the praise and furore around him get to his head but hes not the kind of kid that will
8971433 hes the kind of kid that will want to keep improving
8971434 weve got a team set up to do what he wants basically but hes got to do his job coming back and to be fair he does
8971435 he got a bit of criticism recently after the defeat at sheffield united but hes taken that on board and hes produced the goods
8971436 i think the fans who came to watch us will have been very very pleased with his performance tonight
8971437 hes got no restraint on him at all hes just a young man who wants to go out and play football
8971438 hes a very gifted kid he pops up on places that hurt people he plays wide right but turns up in pockets where defenders dont want to go and pick him up and hes got a decent left peg his dead ball deliveries and shooting are very very good
8971439 there might be times this year when he starts to feel the pace but hes doing great and hes a lovely kid
8971440 it is a surprise how quickly he has settled in but from minute one hes let it be known that he wants to take corners penalties throw ins everything hes a very confident kid but hes lovable with it so you dont mind
8971441 weve had to tell him to calm down at times but he listens to you and i think hell be a very very good footballer
8971442 we just want to give him time to settle in and enjoy his football
8971443 we dont have to wait until the summer to sign him but we have him for a year and dont have to worry about anyone else signing him theres no need to rush
8971444 we have a few young players we just want to gel together and be happy here were focused on that for now
8971445 it was a good all round performance from us against a good doncasterside so were very happy with that
8971446 at sheffield united we got caught cold and conceded two early goals this time that happened to doncaster and they couldnt get back into the game which was exactly what happened to us at bramall lane
8971447 the rangers fans arent stupid they know a good player when they see one so its no surprise the fans have taken to them
8971448 it could have taken time for them to settle in a foreign country but theyve come in the boys here have helped them along the way played well and theyre going to be a great asset for us this season
8971449 its a hard shift on your own up front everyone knows that but if i can do the job of two people up there it allows people from midfield to get on the ball more and dictate the game
8971450 its for the team if we can win games with me playing up front on my own then so be it
8971451 its a tough position but i got great support from dani parejo emmanuel ledesma and lee cook so at times it was like we had three or four up front it wasnt like i was isolated
8971452 everyones in the team for their attributes some might be more creative than others and some might just be destroyers it all combines for the team performance
8971453 the target is promotion and everyone at the club believes we can do it
8971454 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community where it is in fact a court of nato
8971455 i would rather hear you say that not guilty at the end of the trial than at the beginning
8971456 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
8971457 thats not very funny michael especially after you gave me that hot wheels for christmas last year claiming it was my nephew
8971458 sorry micheal the place we are going to is auto club speedway in fontana california
8971459 wait a minute nascar you me i should go hang out at the beach
8971460 never mind michael were going to fontana to see the race
8971461 now michael you should know how popular nascar is and you should know better than most anyone on the planet not to believe assumptions made by others
8971462 not going to go there michael now back to this weekend even with the rain delay this past februarys race at fontana was one of the better ones thus far this season theres no reason to believe it cant happen again despite how so many people rip on the place for no legitimate reason other than its in california and its labor day weekend when people were used to having the race at darlington
8971463 ill take your word for it kitt is there anything in particular i should be looking for at this thing
8971464 yes michael there are only two races left until nascar starts its equivalent of the post season several drivers are hoping this weekend will be when they lock themselves into where they can contend for the championship while others are hoping to either stay in contention or get back into it
8971465 im getting there michael look for the roush drivers such as carl edwards and matt kenseth and greg biffle to do well this weekend theyre very strong at these kinds of tracks jeff gordon and jimmie johnson usually are although gordons team has been less than stellar this year far too often and theres always the gibbs drivers kyle busch denny hamlin tony stewart
8971466 only on the freeways getting out of l a as fast as possible to go hang out with real people

8971470 the brick walls are there to stop the people who dont want it badly enough
8971471 brick walls are there for a reason they give us a chance to show how badly we want something
8971472 were so busy watching out for whats just ahead of us that we dont take time to enjoy where we are
8971473 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8971474 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8971475 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8971476 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8971477 mr chairman mr vice president my fellow democrats and my fellow americans thank you for your nomination i dont know if i can find a fancy way to say this but i accept
8971478 you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8971479 imperial college is known globally for carrying out research that improves quality of life worldwide the business schools activities play a central role in this mission by putting the colleges name into the business schools title we are making clear its position as an integral part of the college
8971480 the growth and development of the business school under the helm of professor david begg and former rector sir richard sykes has been a source of great pride since my association with it began its increasingly lofty academic standing has been acknowledged by many international surveys its place within a leading science technology and medicine university offers it many opportunities to develop still further and to carve out a unique role in business research and education this latest move is a step towards enabling it to reach its maximum world wide potential
8971481 best in entrepreneurship table every year since the assessment began the schools innovation and entrepreneurship group is the leading research group of its kind in europe having received over 25m in funding from governmental and corporate sponsors
8971482 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead
8971483 theres something happening here but what it is aint exactly clear you know
8971484 its more crowded now than it is during a game

8971486 nobody in my office nor myself has ever been contacted by any investigatory agency
8971487 we have never not once been contacted let me be clear by any federal investigator or any investigator of any kind
8971488 go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8971489 the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure
8971490 dont be so naive and self confident youre not exempt you could fall flat on your face as easily as anyone else forget about self confidence its useless cultivate god confidence
8971491 but remember that the temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience and god is faithful he will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you cant stand up against it when you are tempted he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it
8971492 this was a very important decision for scott and we are proud to join forces with a successful team like columbia
8971493 the fact that the team is us and european based and includes top level riders from 17 countries around the globe fits our distribution and marketing strategy perfectly the team works closely with technical sponsors and this allows us to bring new and innovative products not only to athletes but also to consumers the chemistry between scott and team manager bob stapleton was there from the beginning and we are confident that this step will be beneficial for both of us
8971494 it clearly shows that its warm and is made up of cells otherwise our cameras wouldnt indicate red so it can be a sea snake or some other kind of sea animal
8971495 the overall sugar production in u p may be lower by about 15 percent the production is seen at 6 2 million tonnes
8971496 sugarcane area u p is lesser by 21 percent but rain pattern has been alright this year so the overall production will be less affected
8971497 we are expecting all subsidy and incentives would be gone in the new year these reliefs were given when the output was very high and prices had come down drastically and cane price arrears were very high
8971498 now the sugar prices are picking up but the performance of mills will depend on the cane price in the new season
8971499 creo que el hecho de estar en un mejor ritmo de competici n me ha hecho mejorar personalmente y eso ha subido mi nivel
8971500 the conventions web site will enable americans to log on experience the convention as it happens and learn about john mccains unparalleled record of service and sacrifice the site will offer unprecedented access to convention proceedings and will help demonstrate why john mccain is best qualified to lead our country
8971501 where there is hatred let me sow love where there is injury pardon where there is doubt faith where there is despair hope where there is darkness light
8971502 mr chairman mr vice president my fellow democrats and my fellow americans thank you for your nomination i dont know if i can find a fancy way to say this but i accept applause
8971503 it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife
8971504 ask of me whatever you wish and i will grant it to you
8971505 i will grant you whatever you ask of me even to half of my kingdom
8971506 i want you to give me at once on a platter the head of john the baptist
8971507 tour groups and passersby were always rapping on his glass wall to say hi
8971508 thank you for trying out our mash beta service we hope you had fun with it please note that we will shut down mash on september 29 2008 as a result your current profile on mash will no longer be available
8971509 while each of these artists desires very much to be part of the contemporary art dialogue they equally want to remain actively engaged with the people and culture of their respective communities their struggle is to have their visual lexicon fully understood by the contemporary art community while remaining relevant to their own people in this process the artist can at times sense a real or imagined backlash his community may feel abandoned exposed or betrayed by his art while at the same time some exhibition venues may flinch from presenting the politically hot topics they examine
8971510 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8971511 now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
8971512 i dont know what time it is we love playing basketball and i think our bodies kind of know what to do our defense was very solid and we pretty much picked up where we left off
8971513 ive been on the other side of the rep situation
8971514 trust me i know what its like when you dont get a lot of chances to compete obviously its not good when people stop correcting your mistakes or paying any attention to you obviously its no fun getting fired
8971515 you get fired and its in the news and everyone knows about it
8971516 as ive said all along weve got three quarterbacks battling for the position all right three guys
8971517 i tried twice to get osullivan out of the way didnt i
8971518 i was the new guy in detroit last year and i understand how coach martz will sometimes coach all of his quarterbacks through one player
8971519 ive been there but i really believe that coach martz if he thinks youre giving everything youve got and learning in the process hell give you the keys to success i just want to be in that position
8971520 maybe manners not the most sexy word i like his
8971521 i loved it when wed play a school from a more prominent conference you had a bunch of guys who thought im pretty sure i was good enough to play at this school but they didnt want me you get a whole group like that all of us with chips on our shoulders and its pretty powerful

8971523 for some students who dont necessarily need the money this is pocket money but there will be those for whom this money makes the difference of whether they go to college or not
8971524 a couple of months ago we were told that the system hadnt worked and they were now having to process applications manually
8971525 it now appears they havent got the staff in place or with the necessary training to do that
8971526 some callers have found it hard to get through to us and have experienced engaged tones or continued ringing
8971527 the lines remain open and 60 of all calls are being answered
8971528 we have accepted and agreed 150 000 applications and are currently processing a further 96 000 applications
8971529 this is approximately the same ratio as previous years at this stage
8971530 weve had about 30 students bringing in their contracts which tells us that there are serious problems with the ema company
8971531 this is our third day of enrolment and this time last year we would have had hundreds of students with confirmation of their emas
8971532 the learning and skills council has responsibility for delivering the ema in july last year they appointed a consortium to bring together delivery of what had previously been six separate strands of learner support including the ema
8971533 the reported issues are being considered by the lsc as they hold the contract with the consortium
8971534 the department has been assured by the lsc that they are urgently looking into these reports and are closely monitoring the operation of their contractor to make sure that learners receive a good service
8971535 were hearing the same problem from colleagues in other colleges weve had to hand out ema packs to more than 200 students
8971536 our staff need special codes to log students names on to the system and to confirm the weekly payments but these have not all come through
8971537 we need them by now because term starts on monday
8971538 it is important to recognise that learners can be assured that they will receive their ema as our policy is to backdate all payments for applications received within 28 days of when a course starts
8971539 the number of applications we have received are on track with where we would expect to be at the stage of the academic year and the volumes of applications are as expected and similar to last year
8971540 we aim to deal with all applications within 3 weeks however the oldest application currently being worked on dates to august 5
8971541 we awarded the contract to liberata after a substantial and detailed procurement exercise in accordance with normal practice across government we believe that we have the right supplier to deliver a significantly improved service over the term of the contract this will include significant improvements on the service previously in operation
8971542 there is no point being the treasurer of nsw if people arent prepared to make the difficult decisions around public sector reform
8971543 i will not be treasurer if the mini budget in november does not return the states credit rating to a sustainable path
8971544 im viewing this as if ive got a contract with the taxpayers of nsw
8971545 i will step down as treasurer if the mini budget doesnt achieve this
8971546 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
8971547 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
8971548 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
8971549 but boris johnson is also committed to cutting londons carbon dioxide emissions by 60 by 2025 in order to prevent dangerous climate change and has so far failed to explain how he will achieve this the mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing londons emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for londoners to go green
8971550 any effects from the budget 2009 will only be seen next year as investors are still concerned with global growth
8971551 traders are short covering ahead of the long weekend the feeling is that crude oil will surge in the next few days and bring all the other vegetable oil markets with it
8971552 the incentive will encourage more capital market players to conduct arrange and invest in islamic non ringgit issuance
8971553 share prices of reits have been depressed under the soft market which pushed dividend yield to around 8 5 per cent to nine per cent i believe many foreign investors will rush in on tuesday morning to lock in this high yield
8971554 well have to watch the tape analyze it to see what in the world happened to tommy
8971555 he would have pulled me after one quarter if i had played like this
8971556 were going to try to put the best guy out there to win the ballgame if we think chris smelleys the best guy well put him out there
8971557 i dont know if ill be playing next week thats whatever coach decided to do but i want to play
8971558 the bone doesnt start healing properly for a week or two but were hoping it is looking more five to six weeks rather than eight
8971559 luckily the crack isnt as bad as first thought right now i cant do anything physically but once the bone heals ill do the rehab push on when i can and hopefully ill only have to make up about two weeks worth of training
8971560 i said to kev do you fancy it and he said yep he felt confident but these things happen
8971561 ironically i think johan would have taken it but obviously he was already off injured
8971562 its a difficult draw as any seeded team is going to be a good side but the fact that were away from home first is really important
8971563 the match that would have been the glamour tie and would have given us little chance was valencia
8971564 but i think this one like the three other teams we could have had gives us a chance
8971565 we have to be prepared to win 1 0 over the two legs which isnt the way we normally play but you have to be very strict and disciplined in your defending and you have to take your chances
8971566 being drawn away first gives us a little opportunity to go there keep it tight and maybe not be too ambitious and then to come back here and really play the sort of expansive football were used to playing to try and beat them
8971567 i think that if we play the way we did against dundee united last saturday then we will beat nancy because we played as well then particularly in the second half as we played at any time last season
8971568 our form is there so we have to take that into this tie
8971569 i had 10 years of playing in european football every season and i have to make that count because the players will come up against things in the first game and it can pass you by so quickly
8971570 the best way i can put it is that we have to play in the present not thinking about anything else like what happens in the next leg or what happens if we win lose we score they score we just have to play in the moment
8971571 steven gerrard has had the operation it was not serious but he will not be available until after the international break
8971572 i have spoken today friday to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit
8971573 we had no option but to have the operation done now there will be another international break soon anyway and we could not wait any longer
8971574 the player had problems and we needed to do it straight away we had no choice fabio capello understands this
8971575 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
8971576 provided gerald decides not to go forward then i think tomas could do a good job for cork
8971577 i have been very impressed with the glen this year if they are looking for a new young coach then i think they couldnt do much better than tom s
8971578 he was a great player for his club and a great captain for cork in his playing days he knows what its all about to win at inter county level and should be given a chance provided he wants it
8971579 having said that if gerald decides he wants to stay in the job then i think he should be given another chance
8971580 he has done a great job and lets not forget a controversial free for waterford potentially cost cork a place in an all ireland final last year
8971581 the side is ageing a little and whoever comes in will probably bring in a few new faces to try out once they are back training
8971582 there needs to be close monitoring and administration at the implementation level for new growth sectors like tourism services and even the economic corridors
8971583 we need an attractive environment to attract talent as talent is very much like capital so maybe the tax level should be in tandem with the corporate tax
8971584 such an indication would send a clear message to foreign investors that malaysia remains an attractive investment location
8971585 if upgrading materialises it will help improve the productivity of smes and reduce their reliance on foreign labours and will also result in improved cash flows for profitable smes
8971586 we propose that the sme fund be further topped up to at least rm2 5 billion and there be an exemption on stamp duty for loan instruments for smes
8971587 the group ref to all is not the root particle or it is being used as an extension
8971588 i havent changed my level of optimism around our business and demand levels and our ability to grow
8971589 the industry is still projecting double digit growth i still want to grow faster than the industry
8971590 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8971591 hey pappy i got a idea why dont we get our own midget even littler than stokess
8971592 junior its a good thing your momma died in childbirth if shed a seen ya she woulda died of shame
8971593 asia remains a key strategic priority for our business and we have a very active plan to grow our operations in the region
8971594 japans recalcitrance has left south korea with no choice but to pursue the remedies available under the dsu dispute settlement understanding
8971595 we may have to seek action from the dsb on this matter again in the near future
8971596 however it is still uncertain how the qualifying capital expenditure incurred and can be set off against 70 per cent of statutory income
8971597 this is indeed a wide ranging provision and it remains to be seen how it will be applied to taxpayers the concept of arms length transaction appears to be the focus especially with the introduction of the advance pricing arrangement by the government
8971598 late next year we should be able to issue 3g licences for a new 2 1 ghz spectrum
8971599 we will hold a public hearing about the draft criteria early next year after that we will send letters to invite interested operators worldwide this process should take around 6 8 months
8971600 although operators have to allocate big budgets to obtain licences and roll out networks they will gain from big savings in long term regulatory per unit costs by as much as 20 per cent of revenue
8971601 preference should be given to only malaysian shipowners to build vessels locally which will boost the local industry
8971602 funds used by owners to build ships overseas would only result in a deficit to the country
8971603 however priority needs to be put in place to reinforce the fund that it adopts the build by malaysian and owned and operated by malaysian concept there is room for improvement in this area
8971604 it is definitely good news for the ports as cranes play a big role in determining the efficiency of ports this will allow us to go for the best cranes without the added worry of high import duties to be paid
8971605 we realised about two or three years ago that we had underestimated the pace of income growth in these countries
8971606 in the meantime chinese and indians makers came in and created a significant market of cheap motorcycles and we found ourselves behind
8971607 up to now weve relied on japan for product development then wed build locally but china is fast becoming the benchmark for low cost bikes so we have to change our ways
8971608 people talk about the car business being difficult but you dont hear that about the motorcycle business thats because all the economic growth is happening in developing markets and thats where most of the motorcycle demand is
8971609 a significant measure to reduce the cost of doing business is the enhancement of group relief this is available for companies within 70 per cent owned groups
8971610 qualifying companies will be able to transfer 70 per cent of current year losses to shelter income of group companies as opposed to 50 per cent currently
8971611 i think it should be extended to benefit all companies in future for qualifying group companies the effective tax rate of the group will fall and this certainly helps businesses struggling in this environment
8971612 we see some upside risks to the deficit projection if political uncertainties or the global slowdown are protracted prompting further increases in fiscal expenditure
8971613 the jobs are mainly for major oil operations in malaysian waters based on our track record we have a success rate of securing 30 40 per cent of jobs bid
8971614 we believe barring unforeseen circumstances we can break even our investments within two to three years
8971615 our gearing of 2 3 times is expected to go down to about 1 0 with the help of the proceeds
8971616 in the long run it will make employees more skilful and meet market needs this will help increase fdi inflow into the country he said when contacted by business times
8971617 but more needs to be done such as amending the labour laws to support the infrastructure and flexi hours for women
8971618 anything that can increase the size of the talent pool such as encouraging women into the workforce will contribute to the countrys development and growth

8971621 were trying to finish up loading all the ships that are in the port so that we can get them out at least 24 hours prior to tropical winds hitting the port and most ports have the same sort of plans we do
8971622 if it continues on the projected path and it comes somewhere close to new orleans or houston were going to have some major disruptions
8971623 we are in the throes of trying to make sure we have enough people over the weekend to do the hurricane preparedness that we will need to do in case it comes this way

8971627 but if we dress like twins we could be excused first for pizza
8971628 you know its not like all twins are identical twins
8971629 i guess pretty early after the fertilized egg starts dividing to make more cells it splits into two and they each start dividing to make an embryo
8971630 anyway you know that even identical twins who have the same dna can be pretty different from each other in important ways
8971631 even though that chin freckle which one cousin has and the other does not is the way they look different they like different things and they dont always get along with each other actually when they fight theyre worse than we are
8971632 i do wonder where identical twins come down on the relative importance of genes versus environment
8971633 how much of who you are is from your dna and how much of it is from the world that dna is working in
8971634 but theyre in the same world too the same house the same school the same families
8971635 i wonder where the idea of an evil twin came from in the first place
8971636 probably just from people realizing that looks are deceiving and lots of things that look alike arent like
8971637 yeah that makes some sense i wonder why siblings fight so much given how much they have in common
8971638 any siblings who say they get along all the time are hiding something

8971648 our recent laboratory work of the effect of nano silver in vitro on the virus did show that the nanosilver particles could bind to hiv and could potentially block the viral entry into cells eventually destroying the virus

8971650 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise

8971776 whenever there is a political problem or a communal issue comes up in any part of the country the railways bear the brunt of it whether it is the left in bengal and kerala or the sikh parties in punjab which had a problem within their community or the gujjar issue railways is often left paralysed by agitators

8971778 the most extreme case of overlooked diversity is the morphospecies apanteles leucostigmus
8971779 each attacking one or a very few closely related species of caterpillars
8971780 one of the messages of this paper is that you really need all of these different kinds of data in order to tell the species apart that just using the morphology alone or the genetic data or the ecological information alone isnt enough
8971781 however once the species are distinguished anyone can use the dna barcode to rapidly and accurately identify one of them
8971782 this represents microgastrine wasps reared from approximately 3 500 caterpillar species in acg
8971783 since there are an estimated 10 000 species of caterpillars there including many unsampled ones that mine inside leaves or live in fungi this is just the tip of the microgastrine iceberg
8971784 the family braconidae to which the microgastrines belong has about 15 000 described species in the world and its been estimated to have 50 to 60 000 species which is about the same as all vertebrates all fish birds mammals amphibians reptiles which is a lot

8971821 with drivers hitting the road this weekend and gas prices through the roof the last thing new york city drivers need are gas stations hitting them with exorbitant prices for paying with a credit card

8971847 this reflects that the companys compensation programs are working as described that we pay for performance
8971848 i was holding him laying in bed with him when he died
8971849 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
8971850 so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8971851 my son michael called and he was wonderful hes coming home to be with me for a fews days i spoke to ali and cody too im hoping they will come to the wake i asked her if shes going to be at the wake but it sounds like dina is discouraging her from going shes deterring her from going to the wake to the funeral i said its only right that you go but dina hasnt called absolutely not shes too busy out having fun in the hamptons
8971852 everything else being equal if you are happy and satisfied with your life now you are more likely to be healthy in the future
8971853 importantly our results are independent of several factors that impact on health such as smoking physical activity alcohol consumption and age
8971854 during the past four weeks have you been a happy person
8971855 all things considered how satisfied are you with your life
8971856 we found strong evidence that both happiness and life satisfaction have an effect on our indicators of health
8971857 there are indications that as you become happier and more satisfied with your life you tend to become healthier as well
8971858 leading into the event with the information we had on the number of demonstrators i thought we were going to have more difficulties than we did i think the cops are satisfied it was busy but not out of control there were no major incidents or injuries
8971859 gives them a 15 were not flawless but this was pretty close
8971860 they got the message to come downtown and enjoy it
8971861 and i think they needed to feel secure when they did that the security was necessary to make people feel safe mission accomplished
8971862 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8971863 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8971864 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8971865 barack obama took sky high expectations and brought them down to ground level with a tremendous political speech that tried to connect with the concerns of average american voters
8971866 he managed to mix boiler plate policy proposals with american stories and values into a road map for the fall campaign it will take a few days before we know whether voters think obama hit a home run here in denver tonight but by any measure it was a big success
8971867 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8971868 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8971869 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8971870 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8971871 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8971872 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8971873 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8971874 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8971875 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8971876 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8971877 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8971878 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8971879 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8971880 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8971881 she has no international relations experience shes not the chairman of the foreign relations committee
8971882 i will follow the orders of moqtada al sadr but i prefer to fight
8971883 i want to sacrifice my soul my family for sadr i want to resist the occupier
8971884 my entire family has signed to fight including my father if my mother was alive she would also have signed
8971885 which iraqi does not know how to use a weapon
8971886 blood is most valuable and so we want to show our loyalty to moqtada with it
8971887 the mahdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
8971888 the philosophy of moqtada al sadr is the same as that of his father mohammed like his father he wants to serve society and build society
8971889 i prefer to resist by force using arms this is the only thing i am capable of doing
8971890 venite bambini per merenda la mamma vi ha preparato nucleare e nutella
8971891 new jersey is going to love sarah palin she is everything that jon corzine isnt she is a straight talking fiscally conservative reformer who has fought corruption attacked wasteful government and delivered real results like john mccain she has a record of doing whats right and working with those from both sides of the isle to deliver change and shake up the status quo when it comes to change the mccain palin team hasnt just talked the talk theyve walked the walk
8971892 political women often sport the likes of oscar de la renta and carolina herrera
8971893 i made a choice to run a junior team in quebec city and because of that i didnt have time to go to the bell centre
8971894 i would have like to have gone to some events like the jersey retirements of bob gainey and serge savard i would have liked to go see ex rempart
8971895 they have a lot of chemicals at the plant and they do take great steps to protect them
8971896 i think everything that can be done to protect those chemicals is being done and i think the public at large is safe
8971897 our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these employees during this very difficult time
8971898 this is a very sad day for the institute site family
8971899 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8971900 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8971901 to re evangelize the baptized disciple and mobilize them for evangelization and to be a blessing
8971902 at wrigley field in july you will feel like you were there
8971903 i made a choice to run a junior team in quebec city and because of that i didnt have time to go to the bell centre
8971904 i would have like to have gone to some events like the jersey retirements of bob gainey and serge savard i would have liked to go see ex rempart alexander radulov play against the canadiens but each time it was impossible
8971905 the yankees all huffed and puffed about some crazy hot streak in the final 29 games but everyone knew that was just talk for the cameras and microphones once the lights went off the bombers quietly showered shaved and moved on one day closer to that coming vacuum called october
8971906 nothing has confounded officials more than the bombers inability to drive in runs
8971907 when cody ransom nicked a two strike pitch with two outs in the seventh inning thursday varitek could not hold on neither it turned out could the red sox the final regular season red sox yankees game played at yankee stadium unfolded like so many dramas before it with the yankees capitalizing on some late good fortune to send the red sox to a 3 2 walk off defeat
8971908 similarly giambi is hitting 251 overall and has a 514 slugging percentage but with runners in scoring position those numbers drop to 213 and 344 he has hit four home runs in 122 at bats with runners in scoring position 18 of his 27 home runs have come with the bases empty 185 at bats long said blaming giambi is unfair because he has performed better overall than he did in 2007 as for blaming rodriguez the criticism is accurate but overblown
8971909 opponents shook in their spikes for much of the past 85 years at the mere mention of the mighty yankees not this year when months of monotonous mediocrity scared only the frustrated fans not the curious tourists in the third base dugout craning their necks for one last look at the old cathedral
8971910 there is no game quite like baseball offering equal opportunity for the unsung to personalize this point meet cody ransom 32 how about the hit that helped save a season and spared yankee stadium an inglorious finish sounds far fetched at this point or just plain fiction but six games behind is better than eight the yankees at least have a pulse
8971911 its going to be hot and its a holiday we want to make sure everyone is safe
8971912 theyll be making sure everybody is behaving and nobody drowns
8971913 were hoping we dont end up with anything like that
8971914 rock n roll is as visual as it is sonic
8971915 i remember that gig and i remember those days vividly
8971916 last minute on earth what would you do who would you call your mobile is down who will write the history of that final day
8971917 the u s audience is always very receptive and enjoys quite a bit more of our jamming side
8971918 but it is also important for us to work our way to a bigger audience so we try hard each time hoping that something bigger will come out of it youll never know when or even if well ever come back
8971919 chris difford is much happier than hes been for a long time
8971920 hes enjoying it onstage and that reflects on the whole atmosphere on the stage
8971921 ive been happier in the last ten years than i think i ever was with squeeze and that was a real eye opener for me
8971922 chris and i have now got to be friends over the last three or four years and thats really the driving thing behind it ive always loved squeeze and ive always loved what weve done with it ive always been very proud of it i want to enjoy it when we got back together last year its a labor of love
8971923 weve learned our old songs in a way that weve never done them before
8971924 in other words weve just gone back to the records and said ok how did we do that lets pick that apart and lets do it like that were doing take me im yours with the drum machine back to the original arrangement goodbye girl we never did that live the way that were doing it now it just sounds great it sounds so fresh

8971926 he could be some computer nerd out there for all we know
8971927 it could be anybody in this case it has gone on so long we have to be open to any possibility
8971928 this guy is out there working i was not expecting that
8971929 i couldnt get a wave its a bummer but i stay focused on the next one

8971932 not long enough i dont know how i havent drowned
8971933 see if i try to push her over she wont fall
8971934 i dont think so a lot of surfers dont want to go to the gym they do cross training they dont want to bulk up they want to be lean and fast
8971935 surfers would never want to train segmentally the way a bodybuilder does and only focus on certain areas
8971936 you want to do integrative stuff like squatting twisting lunging things you do when you surf you can do it just using your own body weight
8971937 before i would get bounced off not falling is what surfing is about
8971938 im 300 pounds im into bondage and i like hello kitty
8971939 theyre not the ones who blow themselves and everyone else up
8971940 not from racial composition per se but from the better educational background and higher educational aspirations that are on average found among whites
8971941 study after study shows that any positive benefit derived from going to a neighborhood school is totally wiped out by issues of poverty weve been screaming this at the top of our lungs
8971942 teachers take fourth graders on a field trip to nashvilles jail to frighten them away from drugs and guns
8971943 but whos afraid the kids are smiling and waving to their relatives behind bars
8971944 in that case its probably on to plan b for the naacp sue the city for discriminating against black children
8971945 whenever i talk to him he always asks about the publishing house he always asks about the bookstore hes just a positive person i think most people under that condition want to cry about their problems
8971946 hed bought the club and changed it around to a million dollar club beautiful
8971947 what you say and put out in the universe will come back to you
8971948 mind you i hadnt been over to eastover shopping center in years
8971949 i believe the cartel will be one of the largest if not the largest african american publishing houses
8971950 and i dont allow other thoughts to enter my mind to change that and because i believe that it will happen
8971951 i was always a hustler im certified in massage therapy i did modeling
8971952 we dont want people to get lost in our personal life and mix it up with whats happening to our company
8971953 they didnt have anything like a mother and son murder duo team
8971954 a tale of four totally different friends from the same block whose friendship is tested during a seemingly innocent game of truth or dare
8971955 if you walk up to 125th street there are street vendors along a huge section around st nicholas and lenox
8971956 has very popular authors i would be very surprised if she couldnt hit numbers like that
8971957 now some of these houses will disappear and some of these self publishers will disappear but i think already weve entered into another stage of what street lit can be as we see some of these writers move on to mainstream publishing houses
8971958 i knew i was ugly the moment my mother gave me a mirror
8971959 im five feet five inches dark skinned and thick to death
8971960 im gonna be ugly today and im gonna be ugly tomorrow
8971961 i often ask myself if sky looks out for you why do you fuck her man my answer to that is this the outfits the perfume and jay bring me closer to actually being her that is until he calls me an ugly black bitch or i look into the mirror
8971962 i told you im not wit all that romance shit
8971963 we straight fuckin thats it when i come over her i want to see that ass naked and bent over on that sink
8971964 from day one that i came out i knew i was going to be something greater than i was when i came in
8971965 i havent loved a person like that in so long
8971966 the main character falls in love with his bottom ho
8971967 the only books we have left are here in the store
8971968 usually with the reprint you get less than what you get when you start out but like i said since baker amp taylor have been ordering a lot of his books for libraries all of our books actually we have to up the reprint
8971969 i write screenplays better than i write books i have another novel that im writing too
8971970 toy is one who told me hey youre jason poole
8971971 shes the one who told me i was a bigger person in this game
8971972 he actually helped catapult the company more he wasnt just talking about victorias secret but the cartel in general
8971973 when he got locked back up everyone was shocked because when he told people it was a possibility for him to go back to prison he was always so upbeat and positive
8971974 when someone reads toni morrison the first impression is not i can do this
8971975 when someone reads some of the street fiction titles their first impression is i can do this
8971976 its been a while since someone has given us that mid atlantic flavor and t
8971977 street fiction is serving an audience that has been neglected for some time theyre capitalizing on the adhd generation
8971978 there is always a redemptive tale goodness will win over in the end
8971979 i realize that publishing is a business but publishers also have a responsibility to balance street lit with more quality writing at times i push myself away from the computer in anger i dont want to compete with legit baller but then i come across something like the known world by edward p jones and again i am inspired
8971980 while we have a commitment to carrying a huge variety what we choose to support with very powerful marketing and exercising our editorial voice clearly illustrates to our customers what borders feels is of value and important in terms of af am titles
8971981 what theyre doing is allowing people like me to come in
8971982 shameless hoodwives and desperate hoodwives those are good but theyre not from d c
8971983 it only takes about two days to finish a book if you aint got nothing to do
8971984 you find yourself trading the books and you dont get them back
8971985 he was jason poole he wrote classic novels he got locked up and he got treated like that so that made it easier that people respected who he was
8971986 its impossible to be without a matrix else the stage upon which creation takes place wouldnt be there

8971990 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8971991 i was born in the 1960s to a bunch of wheel children
8971992 precious time was squandered at the democratic convention soothing the hurt feelings of hillary clintons supporters
8971993 i was holding him laying in bed with him when he died
8971994 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
8971995 so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible

8972008 mr foundas as far as i know movie criticism is a brutal job and more so at variety i cant help you out but i appreciated your asking

8972014 our point is that if judicial commission is made then retired hindu and muslim judges should be there if the commission decides that they are culprit and they have proof of it then we will accept it then they police and investigating team can file a case in the court but because we have lost faith on government and its intelligence agencies so we are not ready to accept it we are not in favour of simi but surely we favour those innocents who are being arrested in the name of simi
8972015 all the members of the state legislative assembly and legislative council would give their one months salary towards the rescue and relief work
8972016 i met prime minister home minister and cabinet secretary i have told them that there are people in the affected areas who need immediate help they need to press all the forces into action the prime minister has given directives to the cabinet secretary to take action
8972017 most conventions historically produce a bounce just the focused media attention on one side and none on the other produces a bounce
8972018 when it doesnt occur thats really the thing to make note of
8972019 the chief minister has been censured by the politburo for his anti bandh stand and he has not opposed it and accepted the decision

8972021 i thought it would be fun like you see on tv but it aint like that
8972022 the chief need of our communion at the moment was the rebuilding of relationships the rebuilding of trust in one another and of confidence in our anglican identity how far the intensified sense of belonging together will help mutual restraint in such matters remains to be seen but it can be said that few of those who attended left without feeling they had in some respects moved and changed
8972023 the position of the church has not changed in standing by the standard of the church which has been on for time our position is not different from the one we took in 1998 which we called lambeth resolution 110 it is clearly stated there that in this church as far as we are concerned marriage is between a man and a woman it is clear and we have not changed that position secondly people who have other sexual orientation which is if you have a man who is living with another man and they claimed they are married we cannot accept them to be leaders in this church that is the position of the anglican community and that has not changed
8972024 all we are preaching is that we need moral conversion because we are having people who claimed to be religious but not conscious of the morality to do the right thing so all we need is moral conversion towards doing what is right and through this we would achieve national growth and development
8972025 for us in kaduna state we realised that to live peacefully we need to understand the religion of each other and so we are convinced that the best way to promote peace and encourage it is to know the well being of your neighbour and the well being of your neighbour is dictated by what he or she believes in the well being of the muslim is dictated by islam and so we are concentrating on the christians learning about islam
8972026 it kicks into the air with its legs then the wings take over

8972053 what we want we have made very clear we are interested in the clean waiver from the nsg we have presented our case and made our position clear to interlocutors the nsg couldnt finalise things on august 21 and august 22 and it is now reconvening on september 4 and 5 we are talking to interlocutors and directly talking to nsg countries but now we have to wait for the outcome of these talks

8972060 the greatest political speech ive ever heard he was better than reagan and better than kennedy
8972061 t his is a remarkable man at a vital moment
8972062 proved tonight again that hes one of the few most gifted public communicators of the last generation
8972063 by not excelling in soaring rhetoric or delivering a speech that will be remembered for the ages
8972064 not as an orator but as a plausible chief executive
8972065 delivered another wonderful speech that will long be wistfully remembered
8972066 demonstrated an ability to give an address that combines policy seriousness with rhetorical uplift
8972067 an iron fist in a velvet glove or is it a velvet fist in an iron glove
8972068 put a serious dent in mccains ability to continue campaigning with dumb soundbites and too cute by half innuendo
8972069 heard barack obama deliver speeches better but in this acceptance speech obama did exactly what he needed to do to set the stage for the fall campaign
8972070 do obama and the democrats a lot of good in the weeks ahead
8972071 i t outdid every version of the event that came before it
8972072 e ven when barack obama deliberately tries to tone it down he can send an audience over the moon
8972073 remarkable that he managed to stay so optimistic while throwing elbows
8972074 was far more provocative and because of that it may prove far more important
8972075 tempered by a more naked agenda namely making swing voters believe obama stands for them
8972076 that voters really are smart enough and grown up enough to want the common sense approach they always say they want
8972077 left a lot of space for mr mccain to play the happy warrior next week
8972078 left the republicans a big opportunity to wield against him in contrast humor and wit and even something approximating joy
8972079 speech had good lines and good sections but for the most part it felt surprisingly banal and jury rigged and it suffered throughout from a failure to cohere around any single theme or rhetorical style
8972080 as the details of the speech are picked apart and compared to his actual record his lead in the polls will fall apart
8972081 speech was predictable it was implausible and it was strikingly inexplicably angry
8972082 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8972083 now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery

8972119 is not just that it facilitates wrong choices by private persons it is also and fundamentally at odds with our constitutional structure and with democratic self government
8972120 the governments reliance on the internet to disseminate and provide access to information has increased significantly over the years as have the risks associated with potential unauthorized use compromise and loss of the gov domain space
8972121 the reality is we dont know if its gonna be hard to do until someone does it
8972122 i think the beauty of the internet is thats the essence of how and why it works that someone actually has to go and implement the protocol and when they do that learn what does and doesnt work

8972128 i had 11 fantastic years there but with a huge doubt about the future of the lease and building i needed to secure the future of the club and eventually purchased a derelict building in bilston in 1998 which was the start of what is now the robin 2
8972129 after a huge amount of building work the robin 2 opened its doors
8972130 the administration and box office was added redeveloped from derelict offices in 2004 followed by the huge 500 000 redevelopment of the venue in 2005 which spread into a derelict property
8972131 to celebrate our 10th anniversary i have assembled a programme of international artists for the week with some special surprises planned and something for everyone

8972133 crews were called to the railway line approximately half a mile from rowley regis station heading towards stourbridge
8972134 it was there that the body of a man was found and he was confirmed dead at the scene
8972135 i know what i did was illegal but i dont think it was wrong
8972136 i just did it because i had a friend who was doing it so i thought why not
8972137 the men came from all walks of life and were all ages
8972138 you would get your businessman popping in professionals like doctors and then your builders
8972139 we could get 10 to 15 punters a day and a weekend would be very busy
8972140 the punter would arrive and the girls would come out and stand in a line and he would choose which one he wanted
8972141 then there would be a list of the different services the girl would provide and for what cost it was up to the girls what they wanted to do and i would take 50 per cent
8972142 they trusted me and they all said how much they loved working for me
8972143 they knew they would be safe working for me it was very welcoming it wasnt sleazy or unclean everything was fresh fresh towels fresh bedclothes it was very professionally run it was very clean and welcoming for both my girls and the punters who came
8972144 i was providing a service for punters but i was also helping the girls to work in a safe environment
8972145 we were a good team we had fun and everyone got on really well
8972146 the womens institute is campaigning to have brothels legalised and i would support them every step of the way brothels are legal in many countries across the world and this cuts out the threat posed to women who have to work the streets

8972151 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8972152 around the same time that i was reading your post highlighting the impossible promises of obama i flipped past nightline which for the third night in a row was covering nothing but the dnc do they give it this much coverage every time around

8972159 a equipe n o se rendeu o inter abriu uma vantagem de 2 a 0 mas conseguimos reagir e isto me deixou muito satisfeito
8972160 n o esperava que fosse assim foi um ritmo agressivo e com a chuva a partida ficou muito forte senti a falta de ritmo de jogo no primeiro tempo mas no segundo conseguiu me soltar mais
8972161 vou seguir treinando para pegar ritmo e esperar outra oportunidade para aproveitar todos os minutos que estiver em campo e dar o meu melhor ao time que vem muito bem
8972162 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8972163 we can learn from our mistakes after botching the response to a disaster that ruined thousands of lives
8972164 before opting for the convenience of forecourt finance its worth checking out how this compares with other deals on the market
8972165 when it does become clearer that we are over the spike of inflation it will have more credibility if it does seek to reduce interest rates in response to the prospect of the economy slowing down sharply
8972166 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
8972167 the event will demonstrate how networking can promote social justice we will raise awareness and create a network
8972168 the gaming industry has been growing much faster than banking

8972195 i think the audience will quickly identify with one group or the other
8972196 when you go to exile this time you can either get a clue that will help you find the hidden immunity idol or you can get instant comfort a nice thing to sleep on some food some fruit
8972197 depending upon the time well make the temptation bigger and bigger the idea was to see if anybody would be dumb enough to choose comfort over the only thing that guarantees you to stick in the game which is immunity
8972198 by the time this season is over you can make the case that maybe this is the dumbest team when it comes to idol play

8972205 the market is conjuring up images of a replay of three years ago when katrina wreaked havoc on the refinery system in the gulf so we re seeing a little spike from that
8972206 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8972207 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
8972208 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8972209 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday

8972244 stellt der aufstieg von himmelslaternen keinen luftverkehr dar und untersteht damit nicht dem luftverkehrsrecht
8972245 nach jetzigem erkenntnisstand gibt es nichts was gegen den flug der f r den 31 08 geplanten himmelslaternen spricht mit festgezurrten auflagen beispielsweise ein zeitfenster und absprachen mit dem tower unter diesen umst nden k nne man speziell und nur f r dieses eine projekt die ausnahme ausnahmsweise genehmigen
8972246 nach den uns vorliegenden erkenntnissen konnte die pr fung nur zu dem ergebnis f hren dass von den fluglaternen auf grund der dichtbesiedelten infrastruktur eine brandgefahr ausgeht und somit erhebliche gefahren f r leib und leben bzw sachg ter dritter zu bef rchten sind
8972247 das war weder anzunehmen noch vorauszusehen und schmerzt daher ungemein

8972249 that stems from the fact that the entire reason kelly and i started the production company is to maintain self sufficient film in wilmington
8972250 theres so much talent here whether its writers or actors or our crew is super talented its so wonderful to be a part of a community so i think that is another driving force in getting this production company on its feet because when you can have the career and also the community thats such an awesome place to be

8972254 i truly believe we have the best crews and we just need to keep them working get the projects here we need to keep those people here weve lost so many good technicians to louisiana even south carolina
8972255 then the producers and the director would panic find the money from somewhere and then we would start up again
8972256 hilarie and i are kind of of the same mind that unless we have the money were not starting the process were just not going to do it
8972257 damian smith who heads up legion ive known ever since one tree hill started because he worked with us for years

8972287 imagine my amazement then when i learned that hillary clinton our only female president hopeful had decided to steer clear of our pages at this point in her campaign for fear of looking too feminine the notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying
8972288 an alaska state trooper involved in a rough divorce from palins sister

8972291 why would congress pass a law that discourages long term planning
8972292 june 5 was a tragic day for me and my family and it was a tragic day for the deputies who were injured
8972293 we were all victims that day but this lawsuit is victimizing our family again what do they want my husbands dead my sons dead do they want my house and my 10 year old car
8972294 with the firefighters rule the reasoning is that they voluntarily agreed to undertake these risks they know going in that fighting crime or fighting fires is dangerous
8972295 additionally they are paid well to encounter the risks theyre given a whole packet of benefits to compensate them if theyre injured so allowing them to sue citizens would almost be like double taxation
8972296 if people worry that they might be sued by police officers or firefighters they might hesitate to call on them for help and that would be bad public policy
8972297 i just left a sporting goods store and you would think that the number one selling item would be plywood or potable water or gasoline right now
8972298 apparently it is ar 15s and 223 ammo i watched at least 20 people buy ar 15s and cases of 223
8972299 my wife wont let me have ammo in the house for grandpapys pump but i keep it in our second floor bedroom anyway
8972300 i would think that for what thos people need a nice 12 gauge pump is what you want
8972301 just like an idiot to bring sound effects to a gun fight
8972302 if govt officials tried to illegally confiscate guns again they are in for a very rude awakening laws have been passed to prevent this and im betting that more than a couple gun owners would take a moment to give them the bullets first
8972303 my wife wont let me have ammo in the house for grandpapys pump
8972304 nothing sends the message in the dark to an intruder like racking back on a pump
8972305 if the police try to confiscate my personal protection firearms this time they better send more than 30 as i have lots of ammo and will consider them the bad guys

8972326 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

8972334 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8972335 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8972336 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8972337 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8972338 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8972339 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8972340 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8972341 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8972342 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country

8972373 i dont think any player is untouchable thats the first thing i have got to say
8972374 thats not to say in any way shape or form that we want to see michael owen leave this club
8972375 the owner is absolutely and totally committed to the club there is no doubt about that and it is a case of us trying to get the quality we want in
8972376 the secret is to pick the right ones its to make sure if you are going to let a good player go you replace him with another quality player who maybe can take you in a slightly different direction as a team
8972377 look around football and look whats happening and im afraid a club and a manager not wanting a player to go sometimes is not enough
8972378 i think i can honestly say that if it comes to january the chances are he wont be staying but i dont think it will get there

8972386 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8972387 it is clear from the response you are seeing that this audience clearly feels that this is the man and this speech has met the challenge of this venue and this speech was all that he wanted it to be

8972395 weve contacted dietitians that have long standing experience in our homes and theyve never been warned about listeriosis or deli meats being a huge issue or that they should be avoided
8972396 the canadian government needs to be a little more aggressive in informing canadians of the risks associated with refrigerated ready to eat foods like deli meats
8972397 the provinces and territories require staff in these institutions to have a standard level of knowledge about food borne illnesses such as listeria

8972405 i am somewhat concerned about her relative lack of experience in government she has a bit more than obamessiah but less than i would prefer and none in foreign policy areas of course anyone who criticizes her relative lack of experience is in no position to support obamessiah
8972406 john mccain knows strategy and he knows combat and he knows how to win elections his choice was superb
8972407 ok ill admit this is an audacious choice though hardly historic since the dems had a woman vp candidate 24 years ago
8972408 also of note she is a sandpoint native and a u of i grad that will probably translate into a percentage point or two in idaho from people who knew her when but many of those folks would probably be voting for mccain anyway i doubt shell hurt our dems as much as mitt romney would have
8972409 shes smart good looking conservative truly pro life and a great lady but if shes inaugurated in a period of less than two years sarah palin would go from being the former mayor of wasilla alaska pop 8 471 to being one heartbeat away from the presidency thats very hard to sell but if mccain wants a woman who will be acceptable to the conservative base all hes got is palin and a few conservative members of congress
8972410 it looks like the mccain camp can no longer use the no experience argument
8972411 she apparently has good conservative credentials and seems to be very pro drilling but the choice kind of throws out any experience advantage sen mccain might have had on the other hand it didnt matter for the first president bush in running dan quayle against lloyd bentsen
8972412 im still backing sen mccain identity politics wise i really have no choice with a retired navy officer running with someone with idaho connections but i think he could have made a better choice
8972413 our guidance published today updates and expands the previous recommendations issued in 2002 and is good news for women with this condition anti d prophylaxis is an effective preventative treatment that can be given to rhesus negative mothers to prevent her producing antibodies to her babys blood this prevents the development of haemolytic disease which in a small number of cases can cause the baby to be stillborn severely disabled or to die after birth as a result of anaemia and jaundice
8972414 eighty per cent of bone mass is accrued in the first 20 years and especially around puberty due to the circulating hormones this study targets a window of opportunity in adolescence to maximise peak bone mass with high intensity weight bearing activity

8972416 although we hoped to alleviate breathlessness by treating patients this way we could not identify any benefit of the therapy
8972417 as part of a disinformation campaign to stir interest in the selection and to make it appear
8972418 open to all possibilities and therefore more of an independent candidate
8972419 its a philosophical position for the party that were fighting to get the party to embrace
8972420 what im saying is look at where the republican party is on whole life
8972421 that message competes directly with what i believe obama and biden will try to pitch the republican party can be one of compassion and theres a philosophical consistency for us that doesnt exist in their position
8972422 by adding pediatric heart transplantation to the full range of care we offer our youngest patients we better meet the significant health needs of our bronx community
8972423 the long standing impact of social economic and access to healthcare issues means children in the bronx suffer from a disproportionate number of congenital heart abnormalities and other serious conditions now they have access to the high quality care they need right in their own community
8972424 the new pediatric heart transplant program at cham and its acclaimed cardiology team are important milestones for both montefiore and einstein
8972425 dr daphne hsu and her team are outstanding clinical investigators and national leaders in the study and treatment of pediatric heart disease and transplantation their presence here is a tangible demonstration of our joint efforts to strengthen the links between einstein research and montefiore medicine
8972426 the pediatric heart transplant program and the addition of dr hsu and her team greatly enhance our capabilities for treating any heart abnormality in children
8972427 the childrens hospital at montefiore has become a hospital of choice for patients and families from around the world seeking excellence and innovation in specialty care building one of americas finest childrens hospitals in the bronx reinforces montefiores commitment to improving the health of its community by offering our patients access to the highest quality care and services available anywhere in the world

8972432 a third of all cases of cerebral palsy are associated with preterm birth
8972433 this study shows a significant reduction in cerebral palsy among preterm infants whose mothers were given magnesium sulfate
8972434 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8972435 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8972436 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants

8972450 be realistic about how much time or money youre willing to put into the project
8972451 its not a bargain if it just sits in the garage and never gets used
8972452 my philosophy is if you can buy it old for as much as or less than something new then you have made a great investment theres a misconception that antiques are fragile but if theyve lasted 80 to 100 years then you know theyre good sturdy pieces
8972453 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power

8972490 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8972491 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
8972492 he phelps made the right decision and i think the other guy made the wrong decision
8972493 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equalling spitzs record
8972494 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
8972495 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
8972496 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that
8972497 hes accomplished so much already he wants to accomplish more
8972498 he better bring his a game because us sprint boys are a different league and we are not going go easy on him
8972499 i am going to have my break first and come back and see what i am feeling
8972500 its happened to us before and weve lost not just to bangladesh but to a lot of teams
8972501 as soon as you take things for granted i think you find yourself asking questions why youve lost that game so its important we concentrate on saturday
8972502 we always talk about the fact that we have a win here we have a win there
8972503 snatching a win here and snatching a win there is not what im about in the future its about being consistent coming to australia and everyone knowing that we can be competitive not asking do you think you might win a game
8972504 who knows what they throw up hopefully well be prepared for
8972505 like i say id like to think were a pretty tough side physically and mentally
8972506 hes done such a great job at fullback but again he plays a bit of dummy half from there too
8972507 people have been waiting for something like this to happen all year but really theres nothing to it
8972508 some people are out there death riding us theyre trying to make issues out of things that arent quite issues
8972509 i will leave that for you to guess we have something planned
8972510 we are confident we can do it we have some blokes who have played in that position previously
8972511 obviously you wouldnt deem them to be specialists but i have every confidence that should that an injury to giteau arise we have a contingency thats good to go
8972512 he is a very experienced oblong ball player if you like
8972513 he is really excited about getting a start and playing in this sort of context playing against south africa at ellis park something he has been aware of since he was knee high to a grasshopper
8972514 you dont achieve or have the longevity hes had in any sport without loving the challenge
8972515 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8972516 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8972517 i have to put some hard yards on the court and go back out there and work hard
8972518 to be honest i think today was probably the hardest match ive played
8972519 its tough to back it up i was pretty happy when i won my first round but i couldnt be too excited because of having to focus on this
8972520 i think its only natural that the sooner it gets out of the way the sooner it becomes less of a distraction for our side and the wider football community
8972521 we are more interested in getting our structures right and playing good football leading into the finals
8972522 if he only kicks one but our team kicks 15 or 20 goals and we win the game then were not too fussed with that
8972523 its a hysterical theme outside our footy club but within our footy club its stick to the structures and what we do well
8972524 if we do it well enough well get over the line against carlton
8972525 our blokes just get the ball in the middle of the ground and kick to the best target available
8972526 on a lot of occasions because of the way he demands the ball and how well hes been able to execute the skills of the game hes been the focal point on frequent occasions but theres certainly no directive from the coaching staff
8972527 there wont be any racing from january 1 next year
8972528 we could not rule anything it depends on how responsive the relevant authorities are im fearful we wont get the response we want our claim is modest
8972529 jockeys would be better off supporting the ata and troa in pressuring authorities into prizemoney increases we have all been crying out for
8972530 in the past nine years numbers have declined 43 per cent
8972531 forty three per cent in nine years if that continues the industry is going to be in crisis
8972532 im humbly anticipating a game this week and thats it
8972533 im very much looking forward to the game im ready its a big game for us we need a win and im confident we can get one
8972534 craig moore and danny were two exceptional players and they still are
8972535 what was most impressive was the fluent attacking football and we had numerous chances on goal
8972536 so you can imagine what i can do if im 100 per cent
8972537 weve had a massive big month and were extremely tired after an emotional gut busting month i think well rebound
8972538 we were unaccustomed to being second tonight forwards were behind and i have no doubt there was a psychological letdown particularly when you have a lot of young players rather than a seasoned team thats used to being in the finals
8972539 a lot of these players simply havent been in finals football and i have no doubt some of them subconsciously were thinking i dont want to be injured
8972540 finals football in our instance is going to be cutthroat one loss and youre out one win and you get another chance i think we can rebound from this i dont think our players have been that flat for a number of weeks well get back early and perhaps a few blokes will come up from injuries
8972541 let me say why do we want to go there again why would we change it it suspension is until 2009 unless we have 3000 draws its until the start of next year
8972542 im pretty confident we cant play as flat as we did today it was a terrible standard game we were lucky to stay inside the fence with any of our kicking
8972543 adelaide could be windy the mcg can be windy the only place its not going to be is telstra dome and theyre not going to play us there
8972544 we cant afford to procrastinate well have a look at the game and see who we should or shouldnt take with us into the next game but certainly we wont be spending a lot of time on this game

8972552 there is a juridical procedure spelled out in the cis charter for any country seceding from the cis
8972553 this decision will have negative consequences above all for georgia and its citizens
8972554 that country remains connected to the other cis countries by thousands of threads in the economic and humanitarian fields georgia is a party to many important agreements signed in the cis framework i would like tbilisi to realize a destructive character of such plans

8972557 right now we are supporting the ps3 launch we are really excited to be bringing the bioshock experience to a whole new set of fans weve been concentrating on ways to make this game special the things that weve added theyre not changing the original experience that the 360 fans and the pc fans got but are things that compliment nicely that experience
8972558 the answer is no right now this is a ps3 exclusive
8972559 when im not working i want to be myself i dont have assistants bodyguards or even a driver because i try to pretend in my own head that this isnt happening i think a lot of actresses live in this cotton wool world but im very free spirited and i want to be able to live the life i do

8972567 people in new york would be shocked at what one encounters in other cities these days where the panhandling can be very intimidating
8972568 panhandling has gotten especially bad in cities that have a reputation for being liberal and tolerant they have tried to be open minded but now many of them see the problem as out of control

8972617 we just say come and play a new and exciting game and they come from day one they are just loving it
8972618 theres not much organised sport in south africa at the grassroots level
8972619 no one else no other sport shows that they care we say we care about you well bring the game to you well teach you how to play and kids develop a love and a passion for it
8972620 what has been really surprising is that the older generation as well has got involved with it over the last few years
8972621 you would think they would be set in their ways following rugby and cricket and soccer but weve got people on our trip who started out as volunteers and now theyre coaches
8972622 the game should go global it cant be held just in australia it is too good for that
8972623 the international cup is going to grow maybe 2025 well have a proper world cup not just an international cup including australia

8972649 hes worked his way through the tough times and it has made him a better pitcher
8972650 it would be good for myself and for the team too wed get some more wins
8972651 the longer youre able to soak in something the more real it is
8972652 hopefully well keep playing good baseball at the very least this is going to give us a more optimistic view about what we have here and thats a good thing
8972653 the makeup of the guys in this clubhouse is that they can have a 10 game losing streak and put it all behind them
8972654 i havent won a game for a long time and it feels great
8972655 ive got to go out there and do the best i can and try to win another one
8972656 i just cant cancel a honeymoon and take on a national campaign
8972657 if you pick him our delegation will walk out of the convention

8972660 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8972661 every time we lose a game like tuesday is a reminder of that
8972662 now we have to play the mets head to head theyre must wins
8972663 its no secret were running out of time theres no margin for error
8972664 i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8972665 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant
8972666 three and a half is like a series a series away from leading it weve still got 28 games left thats plenty of time
8972667 ive always felt like given at bats my numbers will always be there
8972668 does it bother me yes but it would bother me more if the effort wasnt there and we were just going through the motions and were not doing that were trying right up until the end
8972669 overall six out of nine innings the leadoff hitter was on five of six when kyle was in the game its lucky he didnt run into more damage than he did
8972670 were on a long road trip and weve been battling things a lot ourselves so were just trying to figure out how to do a little better job on the road trip
8972671 we know what happens here with us and the as its always a battle
8972672 weve been through some tough times the last month and a half
8972673 it was just a great feeling in a season full of some not so happy memories
8972674 weve been playing well of late and its just good to see smiles on everyones face
8972675 it seems like two months since we won any series
8972676 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8972677 we played all very good teams that are all in contention
8972678 i think it just goes back to a real simple formula if you dont pitch good you dont have a chance
8972679 this is our time to hold these leads and its our job were not getting it done right now
8972680 that seems to be the reality of it but its not the game plan
8972681 were disappointed in the way we played earlier now theres nowhere else to look and somehow weve found a way to respond to the challenge i dont know whether to laugh or cry
8972682 we want to make the other team sweat a little bit
8972683 yeah a game slipped away but at the same time we played pretty well
8972684 i have a lot of confidence in the way our team is playing
8972685 we saw the rally monkey come out and knew it was time
8972686 youre certainly dealing with the reality that theres no way were going to be able to catch the angels so we just wanted to come out and win a ballgame
8972687 hes getting better again not quite 100 percent as much for his peace of mind as anything hes going to see dr andrews on friday morning
8972688 i dont think the red sox will be the same mentally tough wise after playing new york and then come to play us
8972689 i know a little bit they are going to be down no way they are going to max out when you play in yankee stadium
8972690 we are still in first we still control what happens well be ok no one in here is worrying
8972691 you could sense we got a little bit too tight
8972692 weve been through several periods like that this year where we had to respond and we have
8972693 we have to go out there and win a ball game to start making us feel good
8972694 im a jumping son of a bitch ill jump anything

8972699 god bless you and god bless the united states of america
8972700 when do you think the market is going to bottom
8972701 i think its clear that blah blah blah housing starts declining more loan losses to chew through p e multiples at 10 year lows 200 day moving average yadda yadda yadda before year end in the first half of next year last week
8972702 i havent a clue the capital markets are far too complex to be able to predict in the short term the outcome is as close to random as you can get valuation which ultimately rules the day in the long term is easily obscured by current news and liquidity factors to make any investment decisions based on a short term view is nonsensical thanks for having me on the show

8972706 esta nos obliga a recurrir a instancias fuera de la legalidad para poder presionar en un proceso de negociaci n colectiva la empresa puede contratar rompehuelgas demorar los procesos y finalizada la huelga puede despedir por razones de la empresa eso instala cualquier negociaci n en la ley del garrote todo est dado para el empleador
8972707 la negociaci n colectiva como fue estructurada por el c digo laboral est superada no da cuenta de la complejidad actual de las relaciones productivas y laborales los trabajadores no tienen posibilidad alguna de negociar en el marco regulatorio pese a que somos un actor principal para el desarrollo econ mico
8972708 hay una asimetr a de poder importante entre los trabajadores y empleadores expresadas en los impedimentos del c digo del trabajo a algunas acciones que empoderar an a los trabajadores adem s de la situaci n de varias razones sociales de una misma empresa cada vez hay m s sindicatos peque os con min sculos poderes de negociaci n
8972709 la precarizaci n aument las formas de trabajo por cuenta propia aumentando los contratos a plazo fijo o por servicios determinados hicieron difusa la relaci n de dependencia laboral todo lo que provoc la inestabilidad actual del empleo
8972710 una conducta permanente es aplicar pol ticas de terror de vulneraci n de los derechos de los trabajadores y amenazar su estabilidad en el empleo a n vemos que los empleadores dicen que cualquier demanda de los trabajadores pone en riesgo la empresa
8972711 ramos un grupo de trabajadores sin experiencia en estos procesos y quiz nos falt madurez quiz no estoy conforme pero nos toc y lo asumimos la experiencia si bien no aument la cantidad de socios en el sindicato signific que hoy tenemos una mejor relaci n con el empleador y logramos algunos beneficios
8972712 nosotros no hubi semos conseguido nada si los sindicatos de ripley y almacenes par s no nos hubiesen apoyado creo que la idea de la confederaci n es potente es algo que va a beneficiar a mayor organizaci n son mayores los logros
8972713 lo que nos result a nosotros fue la uni n es la nica f rmula que la gente sepa lo que est pasando maneje la informaci n la empresa nos vio tan firmes y s lidos que tuvo que ceder
8972714 cambiar la din mica de poder al interior de las tiendas
8972715 no hay claridad respecto a los factores que definen la remuneraci n final suben y bajan cambian sin gran orden y como a n no se prolonga la ley que regula esto pueden poner cualquier sueldo base no hay garant a para los trabajadores que recibir n su sueldo a fin de mes considerando que el salario tiene que dar estabilidad y el trabajador no puede correr con su sueldo los riesgos de la empresa el alza del sueldo base queda cargado a las comisiones
8972716 lo fundamental es juntar la mayor cantidad de gente para enfrentar la negociaci n que se actu de manera informada y transparente con los trabajadores en ripley juntamos a varios sindicatos para que la fuerza sea mayor ahora con otras organizaciones queremos concretar otra negociaci n m s grande el resultado del a o pasado fue satisfactorio porque negociamos juntos todos los sindicatos la idea es negociar todos los sindicatos con la empresa madre
8972717 cambi la mente en la directiva del l der porque ahora no persiguen la formaci n de sindicatos
8972718 tenemos sindicatos por local y una federaci n con 4 5 de casi mil socios y otro interempresa la ltima negociaci n fue de los sindicatos del norte quienes votaron la huelga para conseguir beneficios con la empresa les fue bien
8972719 divergencias en la comisi n de relaciones laborales e institucionalidad hay tantas visiones que es dif cil llegar a acuerdo se dej constancia de todas las visiones y sus fundamentos para los que decidan tambi n en materia de flexibilidad laboral no hubo acuerdo yo soy partidario de cuando sea pactada siempre cuando sean representativos de las respectivas partes el problema es que en chile la flexibilidad ha sido establecida de hecho unilateralmente la experiencia internacional demuestra que es m s aceptada y eficaz cuando es pactada entre las partes
8972720 el consejo de equidad no abord temas laborales aunque es importante decir que el equilibrio del mercado de trabajo chileno es inadecuado poco empleo y contratos precarios los contratos indefinidos han estado cayendo y aumentan los de plazo fijo si uno mira cifras del seguro de cesant a nota que m s de la mitad duran menos de un a o
8972721 inflexibilidad del mercado laboral chileno las empresas no se arriesgan a contratos de largo plazo por lo que la principal cosa a reformar son las indemnizaciones por a o de servicio combin ndolas con un mejor seguro de cesant a o una indemnizaci n a todo evento
8972722 pese a lo manoseado del concepto la flexibilidad puede mejorar las condiciones laborales siempre cuando se negocie con los propios trabajadores como es en el caso de flexibilizar los horarios de trabajo a trav s de una negociaci n pero en chile el concepto ha significado m s bien correr a n m s el borde de la precariedad laboral
8972723 todo esfuerzo que se haga por acentuar el acuerdo entre las partes va a fortalecer una paz laboral que no se funda en la inexistencia entre las partes
8972724 el hecho de que se le quiera transformar en el ingrediente de cosas como el seguro de desempleo le quita contorno a la naturaleza original lo primero que debiera hacerse es respetar la titularidad de la representaci n de los trabajadores que recae en las organizaciones sindicales esta afirmaci n se dispone en los convenios 87 y 98 de la oit
8972725 que el gobierno se est yendo abre espacio a que las medidas que son impopulares sean efectuadas esa es una de las ventajas de un gobierno que no se reelige hay que aprovechar la libertad que se tiene para hacerlo
8972726 ninguna lucha es homologable en cada sector cada proceso tiene realidades distintas lo principal es superar el individualismo hay que organizarse pese a que la situaci n demuestra que no se puede en el marco de la actual institucionalidad la tecnolog a disponible nos ofrece oportunidades para articularnos mejor c mo lo hacemos con sabidur a prudencia inteligencia y mucha conspiraci n
8972727 veo dif cil grandes cambios en la situaci n pese a que tiene que lograrse alg n avance para lograr el desarrollo cualquier actor social debe tener las herramientas para ejercer derechos y hacer ciudadan a en otros contextos o hay sindicatos grandes o donde hay bajos niveles de sindicalizaci n como ocurre en francia cuando se negocia es a partir de pisos m nimos para grandes grupos de trabajadores eso es sin nimo de una econom a desarrollada que es en donde todas las partes est n representadas
8972728 el derecho a huelga sea efectivo que no haya reemplazo de trabajadores y m s personas puedan negociar adem s de los subcontratistas que puedan negociar quienes trabajan a plazo fijo o a honorarios que cambie tambi n el c mo se negocia o sea que los sindicatos cuenten con la informaci n financiera de la empresa
8972729 la multiplicidad de rut de las empresas que atomizan la organizaci n sindical tambi n que no tengan posibilidad de poner remplazos y se respeten las decisiones de los sindicatos lo fundamental es la negociaci n supra empresa
8972730 lo fundamental es que la sindicalizaci n sea autom tica porque hay muchas empresas que persiguen a los dirigentes
8972731 los tr mites judiciales sean m s r pidos lo que exige una mejora radical en el c digo del trabajo
8972732 este a o las negociaciones colectivas en almacenes par s se est n moviendo estamos formando la confederaci n de sindicatos del comercio que integran a l der falabella par s y ripley hay que esperar que se concrete
8972733 se debe fortalecer el poder de los sindicatos para negociar hoy estos est n atomizados al agruparse por locales y por empresas por lo menos que puedan negociar los mismos trabajadores de una empresa
8972734 estrechar a el abismo que existe en la distribuci n del ingreso en el pa s hoy lo principal es dirigir la conversaci n a la supra empresa ya que stas son las principales beneficiadas y las que generan este tipo de relaci n contractual y buscan eludir a trav s de diversas razones sociales la efectiva negociaci n colectiva de parte de los trabajadores hay que ir buscando convergencias que permitan influir esto
8972735 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam

8972740 we have got to figure out how to get at this problem
8972741 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8972742 the colonization of american government will only end with creation of a real fifty state democracy in the u s a which could help bring about a real one state democracy in palestine unfortunately anything less will mean much more pain and suffering possibly of epic proportions and not only in palestine and not only for jews
8972743 the zionist power configurations primary loyalty is to the state of israel and its policy is designed to colonize the us congress to the benefit of the mother country israel
8972744 den her type n gletal har vi f et lidt for mange af fra norge i l bet af den seneste m ned og det bekr fter at den norske konomi er pr get af den globale opbremsning
8972745 som b rsnoteret selskab taler vi selvf lgelig med alle der er interesserede i at k be dele af vores forretning men i den her situation er det ved at v re s grotesk at vi ikke kan spilde mere tid p det situationen minder om titanic bortset fra at jeg er i tvivl om hvorvidt nyhedsavisen har et orkester
8972746 i denne uge har vi igen v ret under den normale volumen og det er f rst i n ste uge at vi begynder at stole p de bev gelser vi ser
8972747 c20 slutter 3 2 pct oppe for m neden hvilket er mindre end jeg havde ventet og september er historisk set en negativ m ned hvor udviklingen f rst vender i slutningen af oktober det er stadig et marked som er under pres og det bliver et sp ndende sidste halv r
8972748 vi regner med at den skal op og kigge p 60 61 000 og s m vi se hvad den kan deroppe det virker til at m rsk nu mere er et olieselskab end et cyklisk selskab
8972749 samtidig er der mange andre sp ndende farmapapirer man kan investere i i forhold til bioporto pharmexa og genmab er novo ikke synderligt billig og selv om dollaren er g et op s er novo g et ned p trods af et ok regnskab s jeg tror folk kigger p andre ting eksempelvis at den handles til en p e v rdi p 23

8972774 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8972775 yesterdays announcement by president medvedev of recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has been criticized by the west while great britain has called for the creation of an international anti russian coalition some analysts in european diplomatic circles have compared this event with september 11 2001 declaring that international politics will never be the same
8972776 yesterday dmitri medvedev signed a decree recognizing the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia the russian president gave a special address on national television and called on other countries to follow russia he accused the georgian leadership of ignoring the u n charter international agreements and even good sense medvedev also said that russia had asked georgia to return to the negotiating table time and time again russia did not go back on its words even after the declaration of independence by kosovo however georgia did not respond to our proposals to draw up an agreement over south ossetia and abkhazia
8972777 yesterday may go down in history as the end of a short period of world domination by the u s a and the beginning of a new page in the history of humanity a moment of truth now we will see who is worth what no one on earth not a single country not a single leader not a single enlightened expert had expected anything like this from russia to go against uncle sam and no retaliation

8972779 the west is looking for ways of putting pressure on moscow
8972780 the western press has come up with several ways that europe and america plan to isolate russia 1 block entry into the world trade organization 2 exclude russia from the g8 group of nations 3 curtail the council of russia and unat co operation 4 boycott the 2014 winter olympics in sochi 5 postpone talks between russia and the european union 6 freeze international space exploration programs
8972781 these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as it is often considered too much hassle when people leave the organization they can often still access the network using these passwords to acquire an organizations most sensitive information

8972783 even the top republican in charge of the partys senate campaigns concedes that the gop will lose seats this year the only question is how many
8972784 turkey is our nato ally and as a friend of georgia in my view should have been more supportive of their georgian neighbors and of their american allies
8972785 and this brings back the bad taste of turkey for example barring american troops from going into iraq through turkish ports and turkish territory in 2003 a step that vastly damaged the turkish american relations id hoped we were putting that behind us

8972890 it is a strong endorsement of the hard work the entire company has put into ensuring the profitability and professionalism of the franchise over the last 18 months that we are now seen as one of the more attractive franchises and that dealers believe we have improved our levels of service to them in every area
8972891 kia understands very clearly that without the enthusiasm and belief of our dealers we cannot hope to make the brand a success in the current challenging market conditions and i was particularly encouraged that dealers ranked us in the top 10 for understanding the issues they faced and acting on that
8972892 i was also heartened to see that more than 90 per cent of responding dealers say they intend to stay with the franchise and that more than 40 per cent would like to add further outlets to their business that compares to just 10 per cent two years ago
8972893 none of us at kia will be complacent about these results because we know that it has taken a lot of hard work to make this journey and there is more we can do and i want to see this performance not just maintained but further improved next year
8972894 our brand is nothing without a strong and motivated dealer network and continuing this trend is my number one priority if we are to achieve our ultimate goal of putting kia firmly in the top ten of retail performers and hitting 50 000 sales with the current market difficulties uppermost in the minds of dealers we have to look at these results as encouragement to work even harder
8972895 although our retail networks are largely performing to and above the standards set down in the code of practice customer satisfaction is the cornerstone of gmuks business so were committed to ensuring that our retailers are doing all they can to provide the best service in the market
8972896 this initiative is part of a set of resources the church of england is providing to help churches live more sustainably and be more conscious of energy use and energy efficiency
8972897 in the norwich diocese we are working to an environmental policy which is encouraging all our church organisations and congregations to be more environmentally aware and this new publication from the church of england will be a great help in promoting that
8972898 all christians have an important role to play in developing their own environmental awareness and encouraging it in others i am delighted that the church of england now has this helpful guide
8972899 if one of my daughters boyfriends turns out to be vegetarian i swear to god id never forgive them
8972900 my biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said dad im a vegetarian then i would sit them on the fence and electrocute them
8972901 i think its a case of live and let live i will talk to people about the advantages of vegetarianism and it will upset me if weve had a good conversation and they turn around and say something stupid
8972902 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her but even that i would forgive because its not my affair its not up to me if he talks stupid or not
8972903 id be happier if everyone was vegetarian the planet would be better off for it

8972909 hi all thanks for all your lovely comments re me being on
8972910 pulp magazines in the 30s had a lot of yellow peril characters loosely based on fu manchu
8972911 most were of chinese descent but because of the geopolitics at the time a growing number of people were seeing japan as a threat too
8972912 the europeans believed that mongols were invading in mass but actually they were just on horseback and riding really fast

8972918 hes a smart guy who turned naval gazing into high art but hes not really a great world builder

8972975 ive already been to that cave ive already met bin laden ive already challenged him to a debate
8972976 mi prioridad siempre fue quedarme en el bar a es cierto que salieron cosas en la prensa pero no hubo nada oficial nada que viniera directamente de un directivo hacia m o de el entrenador
8972977 siempre que viene un t cnico nuevo existe cierta incertidumbre hasta que no sabes realmente lo que quiere de ti pep me lo dijo justo antes de las vacaciones y me quede tranquilo
8972978 una de las t cticas que maneja el entrenador es salir siempre con la pelota jugada desde atr s y afortunadamente eso a m se me da bien
8972979 es cierto que se ha ido ronnie pero ha llegado alves y xavi tambi n est ah guardiola no ha establecido ning n tipo de jerarqu a en este aspecto as que lanzar el que sea vea con m s confianza en cada momento
8972980 cada uno tiene su manera de trabajar todos los entrenadores son diferentes y tienen sus reglas hablar de diferencias es como poner una por delante del otro y no creo que sea as con frank tambi n ganamos muchas cosas dos ligas y una champions y cuando todo iba bien nadie dec a nada de su manera de gestionar el vestuario
8972981 un hombre de presente al que no le gusta pensar mucho en el futuro
8972982 a m me gusta vivir d a a d a tratar de dar lo mejor de mi mismo en cada momento y si despu s vienen cosas buenas y tenemos que seguir aqu seguiremos y sino veremos qu es lo que pasa lo nico que puedo decir es que estoy a gusto en el bar a donde siempre me han tratado bastante bien y espero poder seguir trabajando aqu durante mucho tiempo
8972983 es gente joven de mucha calidad que a n tiene que aprender muchas cosas pero han venido con mucho entusiasmo y ganas de conseguir cosas importantes en el bar a y eso es bueno para el equipo porque ahora hay m s competencia ah atr s
8972984 en la champions tenemos un grupo accesible sporting de portugal basilea y shakhrtak donestk pero si queremos ganarla hay que pasar por encima de todos los rivales que nos toquen los de menos nombre tambi n
8972985 el atl tico de madrid se ha reforzado much simo el sevilla quiz no tanto pero sigue siendo un rival incomodo el madrid est ah siempre y el valencia tambi n empieza una etapa nueva

8972991 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
8972992 i dont think the outside world realises just how dangerous the situation is not just for israel but for the whole region
8972993 hell protect a womans freedom of choice because government should have no say in whether or when a woman embraces the sacred responsibility of parenthood
8972994 they can choose what they want to choose and we can choose what we want to choose thats america thats what democracy means thats what freedom means thats what individual rights mean
8972995 we believe in the right to choose for our personal health and we know the right choice to protect that right to choose it is president barack obama and vice president joe biden
8972996 now you have to be pretty radical to have a zero rating
8972997 they want to essentially make it illegal for us to have a right to choose and to make us criminals and to make doctors criminals
8972998 we are in as much danger today as we were almost when we first started here there is so much at stake for women on this one issue and its critical that we elect barack obama
8972999 we probably cant stop it but we can change it next year
8973000 it was the right to control our reproductive systems that made it possible for almost all of us to achieve our own dreams which our parents had paid for
8973001 we do what we have to do for the survival of our children
8973002 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8973003 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8973004 abortion should be generally available to those who want it rather than under stricter limits or not permitted
8973005 or only be legal when the life of the mother is in danger or in cases of rape or incest
8973006 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
8973007 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs with pump prices in the united states rising to us 5 per gallon and send natural gas prices spiking as well
8973008 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8973009 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8973010 both practices are enjoying the strongest financial and operational positions in their history
8973011 this strategic step will facilitate the continued growth and leadership of both hok and hok sport venue event within their respective markets
8973012 we are proud of our 25 year association with hok indeed it has helped us to grow and build what has become the worlds leading design firm of sports facilities and convention centers
8973013 we are very excited about this next phase in which we intend to build on that success and grow our specialist sport venue event business to the benefit of our clients and our people alike

8973020 desde el gobierno de canarias vemos con cierta preocupaci n la comparecencia de ayer del ministro de econom a y hacienda en el congreso de los diputados por cuanto tuvo poco que ver con el sistema de financiaci n auton mica y tuvo mucho que ver con los incumplimientos que se est n produciendo en relaci n con el estatuto de catalu a
8973021 para el gobierno de canarias lo importante es la reforma del sistema de financiaci n auton mico para todas las comunidades aut nomas de espa a
8973022 y si el gobierno de espa a se ha metido en un l o comprometi ndose a cosas que no va a poder cumplir en un estatuto de autonom a eso es un problema del gobierno del se or rodr guez zapatero
8973023 los criterios en base a los cuales debe ser reformada la financiaci n auton mica
8973024 primero poblaci n es decir cuanta m s poblaci n m s financiaci n porque en definitiva las competencias se ejercen en relaci n a ciudadanos a personas
8973025 en segundo lugar prosigui en el caso de canarias la insularidad porque no es lo mismo prestar determinados servicios en el territorio continental peninsular que en un territorio fragmentado territorialmente como es el caso del archipi lago canario
8973026 y en tercer lugar agreg el fondo de suficiencia que es uno de los elementos fundamentales del sistema que act a como mecanismo de cierre de todo el sistema no s lo no puede disminuir sino que tiene que aumentar
8973027 porque adem s en el caso concreto de canarias el fondo de suficiencia representa bastante m s proporcionalmente que aquello que supone para el resto de las comunidades aut nomas de espa a
8973028 son bastante limitadas con una escasa planificaci n y parecen atender m s bien a mitigar los efectos sobre las cifras macroecon micas
8973029 desde un clima de cohesi n social pol tica y econ mica
8973030 con preocupaci n pero tambi n con fundadas esperanzas de que servir de aprendizaje y prueba para las empresas
8973031 ahora m s que nunca esa confianza del cliente en su proveedor va a ser determinante para mantener las cifras de negocio sin tener que entrar en una espiral de reducci n de precios que finalmente pone en riesgo la supervivencia de la empresa
8973032 i think the best word i can use is were just trying to get some closure
8973033 we never want to send anyone out there thats not 100 percent were no more pessimistic about him today than we were but when he goes out there again we want him to be able to pitch with peace of mind

8973041 in alaska governor palin challenged a corrupt system and passed a landmark ethics reform bill she has actually used her veto and cut budgetary spending she put a stop to the bridge to nowhere that would have cost taxpayers 400 million dollars
8973042 governor palin has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8973043 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8973044 after the great success of the democratic convention the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass it is a real role of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
8973045 sarah palin is pleasant surprise for those of us who had hoped that senator mccain would pick a principled and authentic conservative pro life leader and sarah palin is as a governor she also brings an important balance of understanding of the critical domestic issues that are needed and that the democrats have ignored in their ticket governor palin is smart authentic tough and a dynamic choice that will remind women that if they are not welcome on the democrats ticket they have a place with republicans
8973046 conservatives will be thrilled with this pick governor palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energize the base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar democrats with almost one fourth of women voters undecided senator mccain has made a brilliant choice by picking a blue collar conservative woman who will excite the republican party and lay out the welcome matt for independents and disaffected clinton voters governor palin is a terrific contrast to the all washington ticket of obama biden she is a wonderful contrast to biden and a truly outside the beltway pick looks like the glass ceiling has been broken not by hillary clinton but by senator mccain and governor palin
8973047 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive

8973051 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me

8973054 we came to see the initial appearance of the biggest butcher of the 20th century in the balkans
8973055 ive been waiting for this time for a long time but its not like we won a super bowl
8973056 i know my responsibilities to the nfl and im going to hold my own and do what i need to do to make sure i stay where i am right now which is reinstated
8973057 i work hard every day to make sure i dont make the same mistakes
8973058 can i say i would never ever make the same mistakes no i cant say that ill make sure i put myself in way better situations than i have put myself in the past
8973059 i thought she was maybe nervous more than i was
8973060 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8973061 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8973062 i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8973063 like i was just playing on the courts and playing against a girl like it was just a normal match for me
8973064 and then it came back maybe match point and i was like ok now its like the last point and you need to win the last point then the pressure came back
8973065 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8973066 now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery

8973069 we got to within 2 miles but theyre up on the face of a mountain so thats whats preventing the search
8973070 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8973071 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8973072 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8973073 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8973074 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8973075 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8973076 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8973077 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8973078 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8973079 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8973080 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8973081 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8973082 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8973083 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further
8973084 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
8973085 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
8973086 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
8973087 but boris johnson is also committed to cutting londons carbon dioxide emissions by 60 by 2025 in order to prevent dangerous climate change and has so far failed to explain how he will achieve this the mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing londons emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for londoners to go green

8973089 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8973090 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8973091 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8973092 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure

8973102 when an alpha male in the chimp world not the chief executive is defeated for example he may disappear or retire but then perhaps not it depends on their age if young they might try again sometimes you can trace an unwillingness to challenge for the top job to a bad experience early in their career they might have been very confident and been badly beaten up and they are content to stay down
8973103 the best ones are self confident smart and have alliances
8973104 and as soon as you lose the alpha male you have absolute chaos
8973105 it is for executives who are curious about what drives behaviour
8973106 it was not successful because the alpha male had invested a lot over the years managing alliances and sharing food with the offspring
8973107 when the alpha came back somehow he understood there had been an attempt and he bit the beta male its risky so its best to wait until the boss is wounded and even then it might not work

8973112 we are not sure whether he had meant outsourcing in the software sector or the manufacturing sector but i dont think the software exports will be affected or slow down such decisions to outsource are determined by economic considerations by us companies and they will find a way to remain competitive outsourcing is one of those ways
8973113 i will start giving them tax breaks to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8973114 us companies are facing shortage of talent to drive the growth it is in their interests mittal said
8973115 these are political statements made by a candidate i dont think we should react too much to it
8973116 there is no need we always provide supportive data to think tanks and other associations to supplement out position and would continue to do that
8973117 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8973118 at the current stage we do not expect any sanctions to be decided by the european council
8973119 we should not be looking for ways to punish russia
8973120 the most important thing is to have a unified eu position as the conflict is obviously not going to end soon
8973121 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

8973151 today for review our friends at usbgeek have sent me over the digimate iii touch screen sata edition hard drive enclosure
8973152 the hd 4870 has been quite the performer from the word go but its in our blood that we have the need for even more power this is where overclocking comes into play and today palit has placed the hd 4870 under their sonic naming scheme which means we get a nice little out of the box overclock palit hasnt just bumped the clock speeds up though theyve also decided to change it by removing the boring reference cooler that weve been seeing for so long and adding their own design before we check out the cooler and the clocks the new hd 4870 sonic from palit offers well quickly take the time to have a look at the package to see if theres anything inside the box to get excited about

8973156 this is the ati counter point to the 9800 gtx sapphires toxic hd 4850 it may be alone and it may not be more power friendly but its ahem wickedly fast the icing is that it doesnt really cost more than other hd 4850s sure its on the high side but its still cheaper than a 4850 and a zalman heatsink the astounding thing is how closely the toxic keeps up with an hd 4870 cards that cost close to a hundred dollars more
8973157 with mesa 7 1 having been released this week and the open source r600 770 3d support just around the corner weve taken this opportunity to see how the open source mesa 3d stack compares to amds monthly refined catalyst linux suite with the fglrx driver performs for the radeon x1000 r500 series in this article are mesa 7 1 and catalyst 8 8 benchmarks for the radeon x1300pro and x1800xl graphics cards
8973158 great googly moogly the gigabyte 9800gt has some game the little 9800gt is no doubt helped by the zalman cooler that keeps temperatures down i figured i might as well go for broke with the added voltage offered in the gamer hud and pushed the needle to 1 4 volts the clock speeds kept scaling upwards until i finally landed at 787mhz on the core up from 600mhz 1075mhz on the memory and 1863mhz on the shader cores these clock speeds are higher than any of the 8800gt video cards that overclockersclub has tested and represents increases of 24 on the gpu core 16 on the memory and close to 20 on the shaders not too bad if i say so myself at this level of performance there were nice increases in all of the benchmarks used why the comparison to the 8800gt because the 9800gt is the basically the same card

8973295 this reflects that the companys compensation programs are working as described that we pay for performance
8973296 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8973297 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8973298 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8973299 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8973300 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8973301 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8973302 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8973303 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8973304 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8973305 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8973306 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it

8973320 more companies are realizing that risk uncertainty is inherent in everything that happens you start with the risks you analyze those risks and then you determine what actions you need to take to manage those risks when you have that thought process in a holistic erm program it can be very effective
8973321 technology is more and more important for effective risk management its very difficult to manage all the risks as well as the accountabilities and responsibilities and to track those activities this holds true for the communication thats needed up and downstream in the organization as well technology is almost essential at this point to do it well
8973322 this podcast series truly captures the goal of our recent executive erm forum to address how risk management activities have evolved over the past year particularly as a result of current us economic conditions
8973323 these interviews not only serve as a great way to gain best practices from some of the most forward thinking executives in the grc space but also provide viewers with the knowledge needed to evaluate the strength of their own risk management programs and initiatives
8973324 markettools is honored to be recognized on this years inc 5000 list of the fastest growing private companies in america

8973327 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth
8973328 we are extremely pleased that imzs discovery of pallancata in 2003 continues to fulfill its rich potential with this significant addition to mineral reserves with the expected ramp up of underground production from the current rate of approximately 1 000 tonnes per day tpd to 2 000 tpd by the end of 2008 we expect pallancata to produce significant cash flow for many years to come
8973329 we are committed to enhancing shareholder value and expanding our corporate visibility and corporate image to a broader investor community we believe that our recent investor relations initiatives will assure that our compelling story reaches a larger investor audience
8973330 the progress in our efforts to move the companys nichols ranch isr uranium project towards commercial production has been significant
8973331 we have been very satisfied with the professionalism and thoroughness of wdeqs staff in their review of our application and the company remains fully committed to complying with the both the letter and the spirit of wyomings environmental regulations
8973332 two kimberlites have already been discovered in outcrop prior to any drilling and one of these has proved to be highly diamondiferous the presence of 12 diamonds above the 0 600 mm sieve size in a cumulative sample of only 195 kg suggests a coarse diamond size distribution at ch 1 which is normally an indication that a population of commercial sized diamonds will be identified in larger samples an additional one tonne sample from ch 1 has been collected and will be sent to src for processing immediately and the field crew is currently collecting samples from ch 2 we view these developments as highly encouraging at this stage of exploration and we expect that more diamondiferous kimberlites will be discovered at chidliak in the future
8973333 the identification to date of over 65 kimberlite type geophysical anomalies combined with the tonnage potential demonstrated by the first two kimberlite discoveries illustrates the superb diamond potential of this property further geophysical anomalies associated with the best kimberlite indicator mineral chemistry on the property have yet to be tested chidliak will be a major focus of the companys activity in 2009 and we are confident that we will be able to build upon these strong results
8973334 this proprietary thing will never work because it does not use sip

8973336 there can be no questions about the sanctity of information for ediscovery and kazeons new kazhold and laptop desktop products guarantees that data is properly analyzed and collected for proactive and reactive ediscovery
8973337 by centralizing management in an agent less and inexpensive system kazeon has created a scalable enterprise solution for laptops and desktops that are typically hard to manage remotely this information often contains a great deal of liability data that legal departments need to collect analyze and put legal holds on
8973338 in addition to the strong efforts we are making to grow our market value by building our business through expansion and aggressive promotion and strategic contracts we believe that removing as much as half our shares can help grow our value exponentially we are just getting started
8973339 the boards opinion is that our current share price is not representative of its true value and that following the exchange these shares should be trading at higher levels our company is going through several significant transitions including the recent agreement with cinergy health a large nationwide health plan company headquartered in florida we agree that a share exchange program is in the best interests of eruc and its shareholders

8973362 to me this is a challenge when a certain person in the boxing industry hbos larry merchant first mentioned this it stuck in my head yes i am older and bigger and yes he is younger and stronger when freddie roach said manny pacquiao the fighter i trained can beat you it started to become personal to me to me its a challenge because people are talking about manny pacquiao can beat me well we will see on dec 6
8973363 this fight will really be a difficult fight for me but i know some people say it is a very easy fight for oscar but you know what i always do my job in the ring to give a good fight i think i can beat de la hoya i saw his last match and i think i am faster and stronger than him and i am younger also i believe i can beat him in the way that i beat david diaz in my last fight my speed oscar does have a height advantage but i believe i am stronger than him it is going to be a great fight on dec 6
8973364 it is nothing new we reiterate that in the last four to five years when there was global pressure and economic slowdown the prime minister and barisan nasional bn were not able to provide new stimulus
8973365 the problem is that we have lost the competitive edge there are no new foreign direct investments fdis
8973366 the issue is not giving sweeteners to sabah sarawak and the poor because it does not commensurate with the big increase in inflation and high cost what is given does not alleviate the problem and sufferings of the poor
8973367 we continue to be in a state of denial we are not able to shift from the obsolete economic policy where there are rampant corruptions and fail to be more competitive because we are stuck with the old policies
8973368 i see no way where we can attract fdi without fdi malaysia cannot propel its economy and this unfortunately was not addressed

8973378 florida is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this shift in the adult entertainment biz operating costs are cheaper here than in california especially for the plethora of porn companies that operate exclusively or mostly online
8973379 and it may actually be safer from a legal standpoint to distribute porn on the internet because companies arent using the u s postal service to move their product
8973380 there are girls here that want to get into the industry but dont want to go to california some of our best girls are native to florida

8973392 steven gerrard has had the operation it was not serious but he will not be available until after the international break
8973393 i have spoken today friday to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit
8973394 we had no option but to have the operation done now there will be another international break soon anyway and we could not wait any longer
8973395 the player had problems and we needed to do it straight away we had no choice fabio capello understands this
8973396 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
8973397 the bone doesnt start healing properly for a week or two but were hoping it is looking more five to six weeks rather than eight
8973398 luckily the crack isnt as bad as first thought right now i cant do anything physically but once the bone heals ill do the rehab push on when i can and hopefully ill only have to make up about two weeks worth of training
8973399 i said to kev do you fancy it and he said yep he felt confident but these things happen
8973400 ironically i think johan would have taken it but obviously he was already off injured
8973401 provided gerald decides not to go forward then i think tomas could do a good job for cork
8973402 i have been very impressed with the glen this year if they are looking for a new young coach then i think they couldnt do much better than tom s
8973403 he was a great player for his club and a great captain for cork in his playing days he knows what its all about to win at inter county level and should be given a chance provided he wants it
8973404 having said that if gerald decides he wants to stay in the job then i think he should be given another chance
8973405 he has done a great job and lets not forget a controversial free for waterford potentially cost cork a place in an all ireland final last year
8973406 the side is ageing a little and whoever comes in will probably bring in a few new faces to try out once they are back training
8973407 its a difficult draw as any seeded team is going to be a good side but the fact that were away from home first is really important
8973408 the match that would have been the glamour tie and would have given us little chance was valencia
8973409 but i think this one like the three other teams we could have had gives us a chance
8973410 we have to be prepared to win 1 0 over the two legs which isnt the way we normally play but you have to be very strict and disciplined in your defending and you have to take your chances
8973411 being drawn away first gives us a little opportunity to go there keep it tight and maybe not be too ambitious and then to come back here and really play the sort of expansive football were used to playing to try and beat them
8973412 i think that if we play the way we did against dundee united last saturday then we will beat nancy because we played as well then particularly in the second half as we played at any time last season
8973413 our form is there so we have to take that into this tie
8973414 i had 10 years of playing in european football every season and i have to make that count because the players will come up against things in the first game and it can pass you by so quickly
8973415 the best way i can put it is that we have to play in the present not thinking about anything else like what happens in the next leg or what happens if we win lose we score they score we just have to play in the moment
8973416 right to choose blah blah blah rape and incest blah blah blah evil patriarchy
8973417 i do not see that which you say must be believed
8973418 is it possible for a baby to sleep too well
8973419 i thought i heard the voice of god telling me to go save brian
8973420 i felt if i didnt get to brian he would die
8973421 l know now that brian was never in danger but i really thought at the time that he was about to die
8973422 the law says you have to have criminal intent he didnt have it
8973423 you can analogize this to somebody whose child is dying
8973424 are they going to slow down or stop and wait for an ambulance or are they going to do everything they can to get that child to the hospital
8973425 driving over the median almost hitting a woman at a bus bench on a sidewalk driving on the wrong side of the road and that something was wrong with one of his tires

8973427 so he stole some music and now hes being punished you break the law you go to jail whats the problem here

8973429 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8973430 has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its web site and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its site
8973431 authorization permission or consent to use the registered copyrighted works owned by plaintiffs that have appeared and continue to appear on the youtube site
8973432 specifically rejects the argument that transcoding content to facilitate access disqualifies a service provider from the safe harbor
8973433 hes holding him up because andr was supposed to win the fight
8973434 if he had knocked him out there would have been a riot with all of those wrestling fans
8973435 the economics have changed where you dont have the true fan that supports you for 81 games a year we had that
8973436 they came out with signs they came out with banners they came out wearing their costumes they were really proud of the whole existence
8973437 as gadgets get smaller the tradeoffs become more difficult the balance becomes more critical and theres less room for error
8973438 im not surprised its happening to the nano because thats the small one youre asking it do a lot in a very very small package and thats pushing the envelope
8973439 when you have a constant change in the devices i think you have less room to prove designs
8973440 thats more of an issue especially with portable devices because the changes are not let me move this from there the changes are always radical
8973441 what were noticing now is less the idea of miniaturization but more so the idea of lifestyle optimization
8973442 right now were at the point where technology can be more or less be any size the focus is miniaturization in just the right spot to hit the perfect balance between comfortable interaction and pocketability
8973443 anything that is new definitely opens itself up to more risk but without risk theres no reward
8973444 we designers like to push limits as much as possible and there has to be due diligence in testing but if you sit there and test and test and test you lose the chance to be innovative
8973445 batteries are a key concern most gadget related safety hazards are due to faulty cheap battery cells

8973447 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8973448 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
8973449 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8973450 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8973451 and at over a year old it is getting pretty old in gadget time
8973452 a bunch of rocks you cant break and paths you cant cross
8973453 what i can say for sure is that its a really nice looking game
8973454 since im still just puttering around in the introductory phases i cant tell you much about how it plays
8973455 your obsession with an overweight and biased blog opinion writer is disturbing at best
8973456 it makes you the worse kind of sheep this game will not sell well here and you all know that
8973457 chris reminds me off the sundance film festival any game with a big budget isnt worth his mentioning but all these little gay games in other languages that no one in the western world understands or would ever play deserve his full hands on attention
8973458 its sadder how you would never know anything about this game and would never have bought it if chris didnt say that he liked it
8973459 the nation cannot reduce its dependency on oil unless we change how we power our transportation sector
8973460 its about having one event to look forward to thats more about the community than about business
8973461 im going to pax because i think it will be fun to meet cool people who share similar interests and the chance to possibly get to talk to some industry folks
8973462 the sizzle is what sells and revealing new information with lasers and booth babes attracts more attention than showing off a game that is going to be released in two weeks
8973463 the type of content at pax isnt much different than the content we had at the first show in 2004
8973464 i hope that gm sends the zr1 back to the ring with a professional driver rather than an engineer
8973465 how sad 8 4 liter vs gt r 3 8 and only 7 seconds quicker thats pathetic if you ask me
8973466 u s foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days it was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on september 11 last year i am solo i will continue to disrupt at the highest levels
8973467 through a quirk of the metric system this becomes 60 years 70 years and a life sentence in the british press

8973470 omg 250 bucks for 12 watts i can get 100 for 20 from radio shack
8973471 theres a specific law the family entertainment and copyright act that deals specifically with pre release material the rationale being that leaking this material prevents the owner of the copyright from getting the first release
8973472 the first release is always the one thats going to get the most profit for the person who owns the copyright to take that first opportunity from someone is more serious and is usually pursued criminally to try to prevent that from happening again
8973473 in my opinion and im assuming its his first offense
8973474 i wouldnt expect significant jail time but i would expect a fine and some jail time its a felony not a misdemeanor and the federal courts have guidelines depending on how much profit was made the seriousness of the crime and whether the person cooperated
8973475 he may end up getting probation i would be shocked if he got anywhere near three years in prison
8973476 the band is in the position now where they can start a civil action and they would be successful
8973477 but how are their fans feeling about this theyll have their own public relations issues as to whether theyre going to start an action here
8973478 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for
8973479 the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some asshole with a blog so hey i told you so
8973480 yeah im gonna leak all this stuff in such a way as to point right back to me wont that be fun

8973489 i wont use the word racism i will say its a tough but rewarding fight i look at mary j blige somebody who has had only a few pop hits and yet has changed culture generated new sounds and inspired leagues of artists shes now a worldwide phenomenon and its because of what she stood for she never gave up she kept making great music pouring her heart out to people
8973490 you cant always expect people to be as color blind or open minded as you want what you can do is keep giving your heart and soul like bob marley did his music became so overwhelmingly loving it was a relentless love in a sense keep beating them down with love and they cant stop you

8973963 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8973966 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8973967 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8973968 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8973969 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8973976 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8973977 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

8973984 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8973985 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8973986 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8973987 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8973988 bella arriverei ad odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male il pensiero di te immobile bianca fredda di non vederti pi avvampare di rossore di non poter pi cogliere la scintilla nel tuo sguardo quando capisci che ti sto prendendo in giro non sarei in grado di sopportarlo
8973989 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
8973990 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
8973991 im aware of enhanced importance of this issue because of my age
8973992 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
8973993 governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8973994 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8973995 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8973996 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8973997 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8973998 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8973999 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8974000 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8974001 who are open to doing something on the production side
8974002 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8974003 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8974004 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8974005 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8974006 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8974007 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8974008 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8974009 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8974010 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8974011 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8974012 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8974013 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8974014 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8974015 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8974044 si rinuncio di sforzarmi a fare il bravo dora in poi far solo ci ke mi va e mi prender quel che viene
8974045 amados falecidos em mem ria a vida nica e maravilhosa deles
8974046 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
8974047 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzontee il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8974048 jasper what do vampires do for bachelor parties youre not taking him to a strip club are you
8974049 no one will dare to call you plain when im through with you
8974050 do you want me to sing to you ill sing all night if it will keep the bad dreams away
8974051 this is not something our treaty anticipated this is a danger to every human in the area

8974058 years ago when we protested a war people would weigh in against us saying my country right or wrong our answer absolutely my country right or wrong when right keep it right when wrong make it right sometimes loving your country demands you must tell the truth to power
8974059 when i got knocked down by guys bigger than me she sent me back out and demanded that i bloody their nose so i could walk down that street the next day
8974060 we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8974061 with demand for energy both electricity and transportation fuels increasing despite efficiency gains coal usage is going to increase in both countries
8974062 our challenge on the research side is to make it happen cleanly and economically together i believe we can make important strides in this effort
8974063 this is a unique opportunity to design and test new processes such as carbon dioxide capture that will reduce significantly the environmental impacts of coal usage
8974064 theres a big interest in doing something with this stranded methane other than flaring it off
8974065 an important thing researchers have struggled with is determining the structure of the active catalyst
8974066 this uncertainty has led to a controversy in the scientific literature about the active phase and reaction mechanism of methane activation on these promising catalyst materials
8974067 and its large sample volume allowed us to put enough catalyst into the spectrometer to overcome the poor sensitivity of 95monmr

8974070 by far the clearest sign of how backward looking this progressive party has become was its attempt to make the 2008 election a rerun of the elections of 2000 and 2004 when george w bush was the republican nominee
8974071 this is the primary strategy of the obama campaign for the presidency to run against mr bush even though he is not on the ballot it is a completely reasonable plan and if they can pull it off they surely ought to win despite the doubts about senator obama his inexperience and inability to connect with ordinary americans president bush remains about as popular with those same americans as the chinese olympic gymnastic team
8974072 the arizona senator is not george bush and democrats and i suspect voters know that
8974073 on the big issues that will confront the next president in fact senator mccain offered a sharply divergent approach when president bush was fiddling two years ago as iraq burnt senator mccain was urging a change of strategy one that has now borne fruit for the us
8974074 while president bush was gazing into vladimir putins eyes and seeing the purity of his soul senator mccain was giving warning of the dangers of a resurgent and authoritarian russia
8974075 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8974076 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8974077 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8974078 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8974079 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8974080 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8974081 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8974082 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8974083 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8974084 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8974085 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8974086 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8974087 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8974088 these big guys are there with their own tattoos and these muscular arms and these kids are putting tattoos on them
8974089 then i thought about the riders and what theyd need after partying all night

8974097 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

8974099 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8974100 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8974101 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8974102 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8974103 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8974104 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8974105 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8974106 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8974107 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8974108 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8974109 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8974110 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8974111 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8974112 churn has been endemically high in this industry but its how the carriers work as they almost push them to leaving than trying to keep them
8974113 theyve all had a hard time trying to understand their customers or doing a good job of communication with them
8974114 we seek to provide the kind of service whether thats network coverage products and services or customer service that not only satisfies customers but also makes them likely to recommend us to a family member friend or colleague

8974121 palin has more executive experience than obama mccain and biden combined
8974122 so according to mr matthews condoleezza rice and colin powell were given their positions affirmative action tokens showcase all because they were selected not elected
8974123 shame on chris matthews who used the accomplishments of one american to demean the achievement of others i really dont understand why matthews chose to diminish this historical moment by interjecting his own racist bias but he did
8974124 this campaign is no longer about barack obama or john mccain this is a presidential election taking place in the post

8974142 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8974143 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8974144 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8974145 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8974146 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8974147 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8974148 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8974149 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8974150 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it

8974169 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
8974170 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
8974171 second human studies where msg was added to the diet have failed to show changes in body weight and third a recently published rat study suggests that msg in the diet actually suppresses body weight
8974172 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
8974173 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
8974174 in the he et al study the average bmi among non msg users versus the highest quartile of estimated msg use was 22 3 versus 23 5 given this small difference the imprecise methods by which msg intake was estimated and controlled human studies that directly conflict with the results of this report the glutamate association statement strongly questions the broad extrapolation made by the authors
8974175 numerous regulatory authorities and expert bodies including fao who fda health canada efsa and fsanz all have concluded that msg is safe for use as an ingredient in foods

8974181 the end result ultimately dictates if the effort is justified in this case the northern flinders ranges consistently proved to be the best observatory location australia has to offer the other factor in our site selection was availability of research support in such a remote location fortunately the arkaroola village is fully self contained and maintains all manner of activities from machine workshops plant and equipment facilities all the way to visitor interpretation staff high speed internet capabilities and support
8974182 the mroitf mt spriggina location presents a unique opportunity for advanced research and astrophotography outcomes to organizations educators and individuals to be operational under perhaps australias foremost astromony location
8974183 the sites uniqueness in such a remote location towards central australias wilderness has never been offered to the private and corporate sector internationally before according to a commissioned report on the seeing quality of the northern flinders ranges the area receives less cloud cover than any other region of the australian mainland and the seeing fwhm figures were considerably better when compared to the anglo australia telescope at siding springs location
8974184 since arkaroola hosts numerous visitors there are several permanent on site staff available to conduct tours of the existing observatory facilities at arkaroola the experience of these individuals will play a vital role in helping to keep the mount spriggina site functioning at all times

8974189 current investment in projects together with forecast expenditure shows that with full knowledge of an emissions trading system to start in australia by 2010 there is still strong investment in the opportunities in australia
8974190 claims that an emissions trading system will damage australias economic development simply do not add up in dollar terms and growth in investment is a clear indication an ets will not stop growth businesses concerned about an ets would not be continuing their investments now but continuing growth shows if there are concerns these must be minor and obviously not influencing investment
8974191 considering numbers like australias gdp of more than 800 billion a federal government annual budget over 200 billion and the forecast level of business investment at 100 billion a carbon market that in the first few years will trade less than 3 4 billion per annum or about 0 4 per cent of gdp is small change
8974192 despite the small impact carbon trading is likely to have overall steps must still be taken to manage the impact on exposed businesses but a combination of an emissions trading system paired with direct incentives for industry to reduce emissions through both energy efficiency and procurement of lower emissions energy will actually diversify the economy and create a more robust environment for business this mix will in fact reduce inflationary pressures that would otherwise occur through spiralling fossil fuel prices

8974203 hebben meer te doorstaan dan ze durven toegeven meer ook dan de media hun kijkers en lezers willen doen geloven maar wat gebeurt met een sporter die obstakels heeft overwonnen maar op het cruciale moment niet wint faalt hij ja want wie niet aan de verwachtingen voldoet faalt
8974204 een winnaar is heilig een verliezer een slachtoffer verliezen is onvergeeflijk een vergissing is dom een slechte dag geen excuus wie aan de spanning bezwijkt is zwak voordat de verliezende topsporter het beseft is hij overgeleverd aan de hyenas
8974205 we moeten haast maken met onze inspanningen om te worden opgenomen in het europese verdedigingssysteem en de defensiemogelijkheden van ons land uitbreiden
8974206 alleen deze stappen zullen onze veiligheid en onze grenzen garanderen
8974207 daarom heb ik gebeden of god het weer van uganda en nederland voor een dag of twee zou willen omwisselen dan zijn de nederlanders blij met de zon en de ugandezen met de regen
8974208 mensen eten al weken lang alleen nog maar bladeren er is geen brood meer en geen groenten
8974209 de vrouwen kunnen daardoor geen hout gaan sprokkelen in het bos en dat in de stad gaan verkopen om zo aan eten te komen
8974210 ze komen nauwelijks meer uit hun hut en wachten in feite op de dood
8974211 het komt ook voor dat er ziektes uitbreken waardoor er veel vee sterft wanneer de koeien gewoon buiten de barakken zouden lopen zou dat niet gebeuren
8974212 in een dorp dat we bezochten panyangara in loietyo waren sinds januari al 27 mensen gestorven door de honger we kwamen bij een moeder die zwaar verzwakt op bed lag en vroegen aan haar dochters waarom ze haar niet beter verzorgden ze vertelden ons echter dat ze daar helemaal geen eten meer voor hadden
8974213 we moeten de mensen niet alleen vis geven maar de mensen vooral leren te vissen
8974214 het belangrijke werk van de kerk is gebed en bemoediging we bidden of god een oplossing wil geven het belang van het gebed leren we ook aan de mensen het is belangrijk dat ze hun zorgen delen met hun vader in de hemel
8974215 ik heb tegen de mensen gezegd de regen komt misschien wel niet omdat jullie met elkaar vechten daarom moeten jullie je bekeren tot jezus komen en het leven vinden
8974216 een nummer waarin we oproepen tot vrede en bekering is op de radio gedraaid daarna belden veel mensen naar de studio met de vraag waar ze de cd konden krijgen
8974217 in karamoja moeten de mensen die voedselhulp krijgen drie maanden leven van 15 kilo graan dat is veel te weinig
8974218 veel hulporganisaties vinden de regio te gevaarlijk gebied om naartoe te gaan
8974219 als er vrede zou zijn zouden er meer mogelijkheden zijn om te overleven daarom is het bijzonder belangrijk dat de stammen stoppen met het bevechten van elkaar
8974220 zij vertellen mensen dat ze offers moeten brengen zoals een koe die daardoor niet meer opgegeten kan worden maar erger is nog dat ze ook kunnen vragen een lid van de familie te offeren ik bid vaak om hun inkeer

8974226 one of the things thats really exciting here is to be able to market a product that people care about

8974237 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8974238 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8974239 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8974240 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8974241 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8974315 sadly the terrible impact of bullying has moved from face to face bullying to cyber bullying
8974316 it can lead to social isolation of those children affected by it to a point where they feel at the very edge of their social network of society as a whole and in the absolute worst case at the edge of life
8974317 its frightening to know that 20 per cent of children online will be targeted by an online predator or pedophile each year
8974318 and alarmingly most children dont tell adults about it for fear of losing access to their telephone or internet
8974319 our job is first of all to say a resounding no to all sorts of violence against children

8974330 will sunday be strange i am 100 per cent for villa thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 per cent for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
8974331 all i can do is give 100 per cent for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
8974332 am i here for the long haul i always take things a season at a time this speculation happened at the end of last season and it has been decided ill be staying at villa ill take this season now
8974333 concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
8974334 do i feel hung out to dry over what has happened that is what the football business is all about i am contracted to villa they set a fee and it wasnt matched rules are rules
8974335 the manager knows i will be giving 100 per cent for himself and the club and that will be fine for everyone its also nice hearing team mates want you to stay we have a great dressing room you want everyone to stay really but i would have been disappointed if they wanted me to leave
8974336 the manager decided to change the captaincy and ive got no problem with that nigel reo coker has done it and martin laursen has done it i enjoyed being captain but it wont affect my performances
8974337 i feel i am getting back to my best it is going to take a while it wasnt the ideal pre season for me the games are always the best thing it was a nice run out even if it was at left back
8974338 its magic its wonderful the bunnies are back the legend is re born ive had a lot of adventures in my life but this truly is the cherry on top of the cake this is as good as it gets
8974339 it is a dream come true the feeling is euphoric as we recreate the classic cachet in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation
8974340 pull the 2 strategically placed gold ribbons and she becomes nude
8974341 the rabbit logo has to be the most recognizable of any in the world this is our 1 million salute 30ft high and just over 2 stories on the 24th and 25th floors so it can be seen from the strip the i 15 and up to a mile away its an electronic led so we can have any color and any image we want on it we selected video from the early days of playboy for the inside screen to make it very special and unique we have resurrected the brand for the 21st century and i believe everybody will accept it and embrace it because the tv show has helped tremendously and a whole new generationhas become fascinated with the playboy image that christy has reborn in a new direction plus we have the most gorgeous girls in the world in their new roberto cavalli uniforms complete with trademark fluffy rabbit tails and ears as our playboy dealers and cocktail servers and when i gave him the tour of his very own sky villa he stopped took a moment and said this is a very special time for me he was in tears absolutely blown away by what he saw
8974342 to recreate the classic cache of the playboy clubs in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation is a dream come true when people see these venues they will be blown away this is the coolest party in town i was the person who had the sad task of closing the very last club 20 years ago and now im the happiest person re opening a brand new one its a euphoric feeling today though we are very different from the past its very important to remember we are not a standalone nightclub here but an integrated entertainment experience with dancing in moon drinking and dining in nove and entertainment and gaming in the playboy club so people will experience the brand in 3 different kinds of ways its the next generation of what a nightclub should be no nightclubs were ever more successful than playboy clubs for the number of years they were open they had the best entertainment the coolest guests and the greatest food all those years ago today though its impossible to book entertainment in such small clubs so thats why gaming became the important element what weve all done here in vegas will now be duplicated in london macau where the brand can come back to life in the same multi dimensional way this is the perfect town with the perfect partners and a family tradition continues
8974343 it is everything we wanted we kept asking hef if he was happy with what hesaw he said it was even more than we had promised he had tears in his eyes saying he was blown away and he just kept on hugging us we wanted to deliver more than beyond his wildest imagination we wanted his validation and he said we did it this is the first time ever that gaming and lounging have been integrated we wanted luxury and exclusivity without snobbery and this just smells of money
8974344 we are very happy with the girls we found as dealers and servers to represent playboy vegas
8974345 i agree that las vegas has always been considered los angeless playground and in reality the playboy mansion has always been considered a playground for the well to do and the important people in la so i think this will be the same just a little further east
8974346 this is a very exciting and memorable weekend for all of us

8974349 before the second round her athletes mentality kicked in she decided she would take the same route to the open as the players she would train instead of slice serves and topspin backhands she would master the two handed grab and the one hop throw
8974350 for me the running is not as tiresome but i didnt think standing was going to be so exhausting
8974351 everyone knows who the large teams are and how they play but there are others that people know less and it is when you find them before you that you can be surprised
8974352 what is important is that we do not get taken by surprise and that we take these games seriously
8974353 it is a favourable situation because in europe it is always an advantage to play the decisive matches at home
8974354 sarah is a small town mayor running alaska as if its a small town
8974355 mccain is out of his mind he has no foreign policy experience and shell help because shes been fishing in canada
8974356 conservatives will be thrilled with this pick gov palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energize the base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar democrats
8974357 governor palin is a terrific contrast to the all washington ticket of obama biden she is a wonderful contrast to biden and a truly outside the beltway pick
8974358 put the champagne on ice and get ready for a party
8974359 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8974360 shouldnt be using their military service as part of their campaign
8974361 it cannot be the predominant theme but if it is part of a biographical sketch where its one of many images of you its part of your life and certainly your service is part of your life it could be permissible
8974362 we started with one ad and worked and worked and worked and we definitely made sure that we covered this steve is very sensitive about military stuff and wants to do it by the book
8974363 i conclude that the uniformed photographs are not the primary representations but are instead approximately equal with the other non military images
8974364 this whole concept of the guy who drops his plow and picks up his rifle
8974365 we have recently changed the computer system in our elections department
8974366 unfortunately the new system did not allow us to move people whose nationality was on the electoral roll with the status of unknown across to the new system with the same status of unknown
8974367 the software changed these peoples nationalities to guyanese the new software has now been updated and those people who have received a form stating their nationality as guyanese have had their nationality changed back to unknown
8974368 however this is an ideal opportunity for residents to tell us their nationality
8974369 anyone who has a form where it shows the nationality incorrectly just needs to put a line through the incorrect information write the correct information on the form and return it in the post to us

8974376 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
8974377 the industry wide shift to higher household energy prices is now complete all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
8974378 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market

8974401 yesterday i was at the park headquarters in rumangabo about 4km from the fighting and the army was moving heavy weaponry tanks and men in a large convoy
8974402 the army had also stationed a tank on the main road that borders rwanda with the gun pointing at the rwandan hills
8974403 all of this fighting is taking place a stones throw from congos gorilla sector and the rangers of the congolese wildlife authority are powerless to do anything about it the reverberations were loud and strong the mountain gorillas could undoubtedly hear all this activity too
8974404 this latest escalation of the conflict undermines our efforts to resume our work in the gorilla sector
8974405 it is almost one year to the day since this conflict started but we are as determined as ever to get back in it is critical that we know the status of the mountain gorillas

8974432 russia completely lost the information war in the first few days
8974433 then they realized the mistake and hit back they rolled out the general staff and then these interviews by medvedev
8974434 they have done better than they used to but they have a very long way to go
8974435 yes naturally certain conclusions will be made from this situation
8974436 practice has shown that a confrontation in such situations is not limited to armed conflict and diplomatic battles but is carried through into the communications sphere
8974437 unlike the georgian side which has been praised by some for a successful information campaign russia had not prepared for this war and was concerned above all not with the polemics of saakashvili but with the defence of its citizens
8974438 in this information war we still have much to do we have already spoken about this and we have received some very serious experience in the current situation

8974442 every year parents are forced to fork out for new and revised editions of schoolbooks even though often existing schoolbooks do not need to be replaced
8974443 this is a money making racket and parents are being ripped off
8974444 while nobody can quibble with schoolbooks being updated there are serious questions over the number of books being released that parents are forced to purchase
8974445 parents are being ripped off with publishers unnecessarily releasing new books at the start of every school year
8974446 several publishers are engaged in this practice and this leads to the appearance of a cosy cartel operating

8974471 not peeled and not even washed from my seat i could clearly see all the dirt on them
8974472 dirt from one place to the other and again the senior employees not paying attention there was this tall big girl with black hair who i think either she was the most senior or the supervisor the third one was the cashier
8974473 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8974474 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8974475 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8974476 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8974477 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8974478 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8974479 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8974480 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8974481 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8974482 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8974483 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8974484 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8974485 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8974486 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8974487 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8974488 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8974489 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8974490 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8974491 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8974492 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8974493 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8974494 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8974495 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8974496 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8974497 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8974498 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8974499 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8974500 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8974501 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8974502 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8974503 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8974504 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8974505 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8974506 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8974507 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8974508 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8974509 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8974510 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8974511 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8974512 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8974513 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8974514 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8974515 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8974516 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8974517 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8974518 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8974519 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8974520 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8974521 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8974522 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8974523 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8974524 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8974525 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8974526 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8974527 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8974528 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8974529 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8974530 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8974531 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8974532 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8974533 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8974534 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8974535 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8974536 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8974537 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8974538 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8974539 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8974540 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8974541 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8974542 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8974543 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8974544 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8974545 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8974546 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8974547 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8974548 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8974549 no one works for someone we all just work together
8974550 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8974551 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8974552 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8974553 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8974554 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8974555 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8974556 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8974557 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8974558 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8974559 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8974560 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8974561 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8974562 you know that on lost nothing is what it appears to be
8974563 he had some test done and the results show that he has a thyroid malfunction
8974564 the baby will have tests done to see if hes obese or were dealing with hypothyroidism
8974565 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8974566 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8974567 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8974568 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8974569 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8974570 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8974571 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8974572 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8974573 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8974574 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8974575 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8974576 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8974577 el ser m s plasta pesado y repugnante del mundo
8974578 entre ma bouche et mon ventre des millions de spermatozo des sont en train dapprendre nager dans le caf
8974579 i think its a mistake on the part of a company to think that simply because they enroll that they are going to be protected from any kind of government audit or raid
8974580 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8974581 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them
8974582 right now nearly 4 000 centrifuges are operating at natanz
8974583 comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
8974584 india does not need any advice in respect of the protection and promotion of the human rights of its citizens
8974585 ill dispose of the serious fraud office in exactly the time it takes them to understand the information
8974586 winston peters has been found guilty by a large number of journalists and a large number of politicians when in fact he is completely innocent in respect of these allegations
8974587 she was raped and brutally attacked she has very significant wounds around her mouth and scratch marks on her face
8974588 it is to be feared that he has already left the area either for another country such as england or for another port in france
8974589 the logical route for him to have taken out of france is to england
8974590 if a business decides not to cooperate that does not in itself support or require the filing of criminal charges in any way
8974591 a potential election poses risks for both the conservatives and the liberals
8974592 prime minister harper seems ready to risk his mandate while his party is tied with the liberals liberal leader stephane dion has not been embraced by canadians
8974593 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8974594 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8974595 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8974596 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are in the process of removing vehicles from the site
8974597 forensic specialists will begin the lengthy painstaking process of sifting and examining all of the contents
8974598 he liked to live life big with holidays and cars
8974599 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers she is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well
8974600 are the most consistently excellent in house lawyers i have encountered in my career
8974601 working with ge lawyers is like having additional partners on your side
8974602 you are working with people who know what theyre doing are very professional and very smart
8974603 every ge lawyer ive met is a class act they are excellent managers of outside counsel
8974604 they are not only tough smart and dedicated but they also challenge us in ways that make us all better lawyers
8974605 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8974606 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8974607 brownie del works like hell and wont it be a sin that when he gets up to those pearly gates they wont let his money in
8974608 taking into account the success of their own pr and branding i expect they will perform similarly for edoorways
8974609 ive witnessed qualitystocks growth from a small investor newsletter with a handful of subscribers to a leading multi million dollar pr brand within the small cap markets in a relatively short period of time
8974610 how can you be pro life and at the same time for the war
8974611 she doesnt deserve to call herself a woman the republican party has done nothing for us
8974612 hillary supporters didnt need a female vp to vote for mccain they were already determined to make a protest vote in favor of keeping obama out of the whitehouse
8974613 wonder if the downs had anything to do with her flying when she was 8 mos pregnant thats the kind of judgment im looking for in the white house
8974614 this right of privacy whether it be founded in the fourteenth amendments concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action as we feel it is or as the district court determined in the ninth amendments reservation of rights to the people is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy the detriment that the state would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent
8974615 she once tried to get a cop in alaska fired allegedly
8974616 i like mccain too bad he is running right now because the republicans need to be taught a lesson
8974617 on july 11 2008 governor palin dismissed walter monegan as commissioner of public safety and instead offered him a position as executive director of the state alcoholic beverage control board which he subsequently turned down
8974618 threatening to kill mccanns and palins father tasering his 11 year old stepson at the stepsons request and violating game laws
8974619 the current democratic congress has a lower approval rating than bush maybe the dems need to be taught a lesson also
8974620 alaska needs to be self sufficient she says instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
8974621 youre brave to do that and youre horrible for expecting other people to try and be more courageous too
8974622 she hunts eats moose hamburger ice fishes rides snowmobiles and owns a float plane 11 12 palin holds a lifetime membership with the national rifle association
8974623 this is an insult to clinton supporters who backed a seasoned veteran politician with years and years of experience
8974624 will be crazy to see how my clinton supporters go repub now
8974625 for those saying its only a stunt in 2007 palin had an approval rating often in the 90s 12 a poll published by hays research on july 28 2008 showed palins approval rating at 80 source wiki shes a true conservative and has pushed for ethics in politics shes not a career politician either brilliant choice
8974626 the only question is how much power will she really have
8974627 as designated by the constitution of the united states the vice president also serves as the president of the senate and may break tie votes in that chamber
8974628 that promotes the conservation and efficient recovery of domestic oil and natural gas resources while protecting health safety and the environment
8974629 palin 44 whos in her first term as governor of alaska
8974630 its a blue collar in the field type job working in a facility as a production operator separating the oil the gas and water its not a management position where decision are being made for the future of investment with this oil company in alaska
8974631 it should be rooted in the qualifications to lead and vision of betterment from the past this isnt about gender or sex this is about policy and direction
8974632 there are no tankers or ways of moving oil from alaska ship builders are ten years out to make a tanker
8974633 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
8974634 3 will channel the women vote and hillary supporters in particular
8974635 ha ha i picked a woman he didnt vote for me hillary supporters
8974636 she hunts eats moose hamburger ice fishes rides snowmobiles and owns a float plane palin holds a lifetime membership with the national rifle association she admits that she used marijuana when it was legal in alaska but says that she did not like it
8974637 i find it offensive that mccain thinks he can bring over hillary supporters by nominating a women
8974638 let me say something here and if it were not so i simply would not say it
8974639 if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
8974640 many of todays major towing companies had humble origins getting their start with a single small vessel today an enterprising mariner with his or her own boat has almost no chance
8974641 bad check writers might reasonably be excluded from working in banks but this offense should not be disqualifying for port laborers who have gone on to live crime free lives
8974642 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day
8974643 affects women who are famous who are not famous women who have money women who have no money this is an issue that crosses all boundaries and it certainly affects everyone
8974644 understanding the consumer is much more than knowing how and when to talk to them its also knowing when not to
8974645 if a woman wants to kill her baby right after its born let her this is america the land of choice
8974646 lets destroy the traditional family unit because i am all behind tearing down the defense of marriage act as soon as i get into office that will make america a much better place
8974647 let legallize all those illegal immigrants that are diminishing the quality of life in our country by not paying taxes but abuse our welfare and hospital systems and do not give very little in return they are what makes america so great
8974648 clinton would have made a great adman he understands branding and how to strategically differentiate the brand in a way that speaks to the consumer to win perhaps mccain needs some pointers from clinton for if mccain uses the same tactics as clinton on obama hell come out on top
8974649 he ingresado voluntariamente en un centro para el tratamiento de la adicci n al sexo

8974662 ill be off the crutches right away and its feeling a lot better than it felt the first few weeks
8974663 i never thought id have to go through this but ive been lucky my whole football career now that im one of those guys on the sidelines just sitting and watching it just kills me inside all your buddies are putting in all that hard work going to practice every day and youre just sitting there trying to get your leg better
8974664 its really hard when i go home and my roommates watching film and everything and doing those things dont help me at all because im not playing the game right now
8974665 just to watch them practice every day just kills me inside too sometimes you cant handle it you just have to do something else
8974666 if i would have had a couple of days like that i would have been right in there
8974667 it was a good day im disappointed with my tee shot on 17 but other than that i cant say i didnt play well i played like i can play
8974668 it was a much better start and when i can do that and get a couple putts in the hole right away it makes a difference
8974669 the wind turned around today so we were playing a whole new golf course every day this week
8974670 it was just incredible the northeast wind came in today so everyone was dumbfounded and going now what are we going to do
8974671 i just went with my gut and said hit the ball like you can just bear down and do it and i thats what i did
8974672 that was the bad hole though that was it otherwise things were really good
8974673 it was great to be able to get up there
8974674 i was happy with my round and it makes me a lot happier to be going home with this as opposed to another 84
8974675 you really have to play this golf course a lot to know exactly where you have to be and this was my fourth time on it so that made a difference
8974676 weve always had lots of kids theyve worked their way up some of our open pullers for nationals first went to nationals as youths
8974677 this ones got a strong upper body so i thought it might be something she would enjoy

8974691 only three years after hurricanes katrina and rita devastated gulf of mexico oil and gas production an emerging hurricane storm is tracking another potentially lethal swath through americas energy heartland

8974772 we are taking our children and leaving and we dont even know where we are going
8974773 i know how villagers are somehow managing to keep themselves alive by eating whatever food is available to them
8974774 it is not easy to distribute food to over two million displaced villagers i know their condition
8974775 the camps are not organised yet and we are receiving reports of diseases
8974776 the cyclone will have more than 24 hours over the very warm waters of the northwestern caribbean so strengthening seems imminent and could even be rapid
8974777 i think were going to get more than what most people expect
8974778 this loss of food is equivalent to a loss in water
8974779 another 10 to 15 percent is discarded during processing transport and storage in richer countries production is more efficient but waste is greater people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow ship and produce the food along with it
8974780 the attention now because of the global food crisis has shifted towards improving food production while no one is paying attention to address the losses and wastage already taking place
8974781 distribution and access to food is a problem while at the same time many people in many parts of the world over eat
8974782 people have access to more money and diets that include meat and milk
8974783 much of the future increase will be fed to animals to satisfy the demand for meat today some 650 million tonnes of grain nearly 40 percent of global production is fed to livestock and this may reach 1100 million tonnes by 2050
8974784 for example 500 to 4 000 litres of water are evaporated in producing one kilogram of wheat depending on climate agricultural practices variety length of the growing season and yield
8974785 however to produce one kilogramme of meat takes 5 000 to 20 000 litres mainly to grow animal feed in terms of the energy content of food approximately 0 5 m3 of water is needed to produce 1 000 kcal of plant based food while for animal based food some 4 m3 of water is required
8974786 agriculture in countries in central south and south east asia which are largely dependent on river water for irrigation will be hit by a projected drop in river levels an estimated 1 4 billion people already live in areas where there is not enough water available to meet all needs from sectors of society let alone the need of aquatic ecosystems
8974787 countries have to come to up with innovative ways to capture and beneficially use the rain falling on farmers fields to increase the fraction of the rains that can be productively used and to lessen stresses on rivers and groundwater

8974851 broke into the police station to confirm the men were not there
8974852 two british men were arrested after failing to stop at a checkpoint there was an exchange of gunfire the men were wearing traditional arab clothing and when the police eventually stopped them they said they found explosives and weapons in their car its widely believed the two british servicemen were operating undercover
8974853 iraqi security officials on monday variously accused the two britons they detained of shooting at iraqi forces or trying to plant explosives
8974854 the two undercover soldiers were arrested after opening fire on iraqi police who approached them
8974855 the men were wearing traditional arab headscarves and sitting in an unmarked car
8974856 a policeman approached them and then one of these guys fired at him then the police managed to capture them
8974857 caught two non iraqis who seem to be britons and were in a car of the cressida type it was a booby trapped car laden with ammunition and was meant to explode in the centre of the city of basra in the popular market
8974858 at the intelligence department in basra and they were held by the national guard force but the british occupation forces are still surrounding this department in an attempt to absolve them of the crime
8974859 modelled on an undercover unit that operated in northern ireland
8974860 absorbed the 14th intelligence company known as 14 int a plainclothes unit set up to gather intelligence covertly on suspect terrorists in northern ireland its recruits are trained by the sas
8974861 military intelligence was colluding with terrorists to help them kill so called legitimate targets such as active republicans many of the victims of these government backed hit squads were innocent civilians
8974862 i mixed explosive and i helped develop new types of bombs
8974863 i moved weapons if you ask me if the materials i handled killed anyone then i will have to say that some of the things i helped develop did kill my handlers knew everything i did i was never told not to do something that was discussed how can you pretend to be a terrorist and not act like one you cant youve got to do what they do they did a lot of murders i broke the law seven days a week and my handlers knew that they knew that i was making bombs and giving them to other members of the ira and they did nothing about it the idea was that the only way to beat the enemy was to penetrate the enemy and be the enemy

8974865 responsible for the investigation of all in theatre serious incidents plus investigations conducted by the general police duties element of the theatre investigation group
8974866 the ministry of defence refused to reveal details about his masters work but it is believed he was involved in the inquiry into the dramatic rescue of two sas soldiers held in a prison in basra
8974867 to smash through the walls of the jail and free the two british servicemen
8974868 will pay compensation for injuries and damage caused during the storming by the army of a police station in basra in the operation to release two sas soldiers
8974869 compensation to the families of alleged iraqi victims who died during the fracas depended on the official investigation being carried out by captain masters and his team
8974870 the circumstances of his death were not regarded as suspicious
8974871 capt masters was part of quite a small outfit and his job would have been quite stressful its quite an onerous job i think there is quite a lot of stress involved
8974872 little is known of his private life and it is said to be unlikely that the pressures of work would have led him to commit suicide
8974873 multitudes of syrians thronged the streets to celebrate liberation from the ottoman empire
8974874 there have been indiscriminate arrests the most recent of which was the arrest of shaykh ahmad al farqusi and two basra citizens on the pretext that they had carried out terrorist operations to kill us soldiers this is a baseless claim
8974875 we called a protest outside the mayors office on monday the 19th demanding the sheikh be released
8974876 the sons of basra caught two non iraqis who seem to be britons and were in a car of the cressida type it was a booby trapped car laden with ammunition and was meant to explode in the centre of the city of basra in the popular market however the sons of the city of basra arrested them they the two non iraqis then fired at the people there and killed some of them the two arrested persons are now at the intelligence department in basra and they were held by the national guard force but the british occupation forces are still surrounding this department in an attempt to absolve them of the crime
8974877 events in our city took a sinister turn when the police tried to stop two men dressed as members of the mehdi army militia driving near the protest the men opened fire on the police and passers by after a car chase they were arrested
8974878 attention editors the british government requests that the identification of this man is not revealed either via pixellation of their faces or by not publishing the photos
8974879 in an emergency please call us and uk forces on these numbers
8974880 they looked like computer characters with shotguns machine guns pistols and knives
8974881 the helicopter gave us directions and we followed stormed the street rescued the two guys and got out they had been battered half to death but were ok they thanked us for saving their lives and two choppers came down and away they all went
8974882 this incident gave answers to questions and suspicions that were lacking evidence about the participation of the occupation in some armed operations in iraq
8974883 what the two britons did was literally international terrorism if the british had condemned this it would have calmed the situation but instead they came and demanded them back which sets a dangerous precedent
8974884 it is a very unfortunate development that the british forces should try to release their forces the way it happened
8974885 were acting very suspiciously like they were watching something and collecting information in civilian clothes in these tense times
8974886 from an early stage i had good reason to believe the lives of the two soldiers were at risk
8974887 the british promised us sovereignty so where is this sovereignty if they destroy a police station

8974909 state sponsored terrorism is by far the most serious category of terrorism in the world today
8974910 to be sidelined by something so simple is really disappointing but while the injury isnt serious it is really painful especially when youre on the bike
8974911 i thought i was back to full fitness after resting up since brno but then i managed to tweak the same intercostal muscle during a light training session on thursday evening and the pain kept me awake most of the night
8974912 the injury has responded well to treatment and is now much improved but the lack of sleep meant that it was difficult to concentrate fully ahead of this afternoons practice session
8974913 i have a good advantage but for me its too early to make this decision to race for second place
8974914 first because racing for second place is always unlucky and second because there are six races to the end and not just two
8974915 we have to work like in the last races and try to beat casey and fight with him
8974916 there is a long way to the end and i think at this race there will be some more riders who will be able to stay close to me and stoner
8974917 to try to repeat what we did in laguna we have to improve the settings because at some parts of the track im not fast enough especially in the last part

8974921 listen just listen and just dig deeply what theyre saying thats the kind of doctor to be not just a doctor that understands big words doctor talk whatever im the one here with my child you got to listen to what im saying about my child
8974922 when we was in the waiting room the surgeon he came out and he explained to us how serious it was he even told us how long she might live to me he was just like part of us at that moment and i really appreciate him for that because that was the beginning of it and that would have been the most important part right there the way he handled it the way he took care of it he even got a little room off to the side for us to go in by ourself for a minute that particular surgeon ill never never forget him i can just picture him the way he present himself the way he express himself the body movements the caring i mean he just let you know you can just feel it
8974923 i dont always speak correctly in everything i say so i dont want you to use that against me that i dont understand everything that you are saying if you get one of those big words out to me you know throw it that way but if you give me time i might understand what you are saying
8974924 you need to go in there waiting to see what they bring to you and not bringing what you have seeing what the family makeup is and seeing the different roles people have in the family and then supporting them any way that you can versus bringing your structure into their home because it doesnt tend to work very well
8974925 weve had some good battles with st norbert the past couple years
8974926 the past couple years theyve actually had our number and weve been disappointed because from the run of play it seems like were closer than the scores been showing so im hoping we can come out and im hoping thats a game were motivated to play for
8974927 wherever i put her if i put her up top or as the outside midfielder shes always working as hard as she can and the work always ends up in her creating a goal or two she has a lot of energy to her play especially so far in the preseason
8974928 there were a couple games last year where we were hurting for some goals and i gave gina weiss a couple starts and she really repaid that and came away scoring a couple goals
8974929 so i think when ginas motivated she can make that happen
8974930 shes really skilled and sees the field very well so i think shell have a hand in creating the goals
8974931 therell be some practices where shes just set on fire and will bang in four or five goals in a row
8974932 we should have a pretty good balance for the offense some good leadership
8974933 jacqui drexler and maggie short theyve got a lot of experience back there and theyve been teammates for awhile so i see that as a good thing
8974934 megans just steady and solid back there we always know what shes going to give
8974935 last year she ended up earning her way into the starting line up as the year went on i think if she can maintain her health and be healthy the whole way through i dont see why she would do anything different
8974936 shes a smart player and i think coming in having that year under her belt i think thats a very good thing for her because i think she can really be a big force in the back for the next three years
8974937 shes got a good strong physical aspect to her game too
8974938 she can hold the ball well she can distribute it and she can also score when she needs to as well im excited to see how she does
8974939 her physical size is good shes been able to get up and win a couple head balls and score some nice goals
8974940 she might be something thats a positive for us in free kicks or corner kicks
8974941 i think playing level i think were going to see some different players but skill wise i think weve got some good skill players coming in
8974942 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice to feed his addiction i am not standing in his way i am not the reason he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is
8974943 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified
8974944 thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8974945 vamos a estar instrumentando una direcci n de mail y si podemos un 0800 digo si podemos porque hay que entrenar a la gente para recibir denuncias y no se va a exigir obligatoriamente identificaci n del denunciante o sea se podr n hacer denuncias an nimas
8974946 seguramente vamos a preferir tener la identificaci n llamando a la responsabilidad porque eso nos ayuda m s
8974947 sabemos que cuando uno abre una instancia de este tipo vienen muchas cosas que no corresponden pero tenemos que encontrar una forma para que cualquiera que conozca un acto pueda llegar a las autoridades competentes para hac rselo conocer

8974951 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8974952 they say having kids at my age either makes you or breaks you and im leaning heavily toward break right now
8974953 theres no piece of paper that is necessary if you have it in your head and heart to spend the rest of your lives together
8974954 i dont need to change my name and the whole giving away the bride what is the point of it
8974955 the soul mate myth is destructive because it will keep you from forming authentic relationships that have a chance to thrive instead of fail
8974956 dont marry because you think you have found your soul mate it is bound to buckle under the unbearable weight of expected perfection
8974957 it seems to me that people are looking for a clone
8974958 he supports me he believes in me marriage cant be me me me what does he get out of it
8974959 nowadays it doesnt have to be that women want to marry a doctor because she is the doctor
8974960 have fun in your 20s get a good job get married have a family that path will make some women happy but for others it wont
8974961 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8974962 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8974963 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8974964 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8974965 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids

8974983 its not a voice weve heard in the party before
8974984 i think she is fantastic she is a fresh face for the republican party that adds to the diversity of the party she will also appeal to the conservative base of the party because of her record
8974985 having the primary on top of the holiday season just barely a few days after the iowa caucus i think does a great disservice to the voters

8975032 there are 10 clubs in melbourne and most of them think of sydney and brisbane as their recruiting grounds
8975033 they make our players the focus of their recruiting raids which i guess to labour a point is why the retention allowance was brought in
8975034 if they could make our players off limits to melbourne clubs recruiting raids that might help
8975035 its about action i can talk they can talk we can all talk

8975108 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8975109 this sends a message that washington is committed to taiwans defense
8975110 and with some sort of framework for improved cross strait relations under consideration taiwan needs to bargain from a position of strength
8975111 but the fact is unless these harpoons have some sort of magical power anything that costs 90 million isnt going to dramatically tip the balance one way or the other
8975112 my guess is that the administration was waiting until the olympics were over so as not to embarrass president hu jintao and the chinese leadership
8975113 now that bush has returned my expectation is that we will see a number of sales move ahead to congress for review in the weeks ahead
8975114 it seems there isnt urgency to move forward and perhaps even a preference to leave this decision to bushs successor
8975115 karma has bitten big brother player ollie right in the ass
8975116 cbs summer reality hit big brother 10 is in full swing offering all the drama backstabbing and manipulation typical of previous bb seasons
8975117 to this day ollie does not drink smoke or curse staying true to the values he was raised with as a child
8975118 this sends a message that washington is committed to taiwans defense

8975126 you will hear it all i have 101 text messages between lindsay and i and i have about 60 tape recordings of dina
8975127 it might be broken up into parts but its going to be done
8975128 these lies have to stop she cant say all these things to me and when i try to address it deny everything dinas a hypocrite and im tired of it
8975129 ive never taken or earned one penny from my daughter meanwhile all the people around her including her mother are earning money off of her
8975130 they want publicity theyre there for self serving reasons i didnt have my own reality tv show
8975131 the pre paid metering scheme called payu for pay as you use involves replacing conventional power meters with special ones that work only if an account has sufficient credit in it users can top up amounts from 10 to 250 into their accounts as electricity is used the sum is drawn down and has to be topped up twenty per cent of what they top up goes into settling their outstanding balances with sp services madam noorfarizan abdul rahim 30 went on the scheme after failing to pay her bills for three months her family owes sp services over 400 but with four children to feed on a single income of 850 a month putting food on the table not paying bills gets top priority madam noorfarizan whose husband is a cleaner and whose children are aged between eight months and 10 years old said the price of rice has gone up the price of cooking oil has gone up and everything has gone up to help a little go a long way as far as energy is concerned she restricts activities like watching tv social workers say that other such families also resort to leaving their flats in darkness many throw doors and windows open to catch available light from common corridors madam noorfarizan topped up her payu account with 10 a few days ago but just 3 remains she will head to the post office today to top up another 10 good for two to three days of power
8975132 afraid to lose afraid to die and definitely edible sure win
8975133 the majority of parliamentarians voted one way and heartlanders the other
8975134 when i hit it i had a pretty good feeling
8975135 i knew i hit it right when the ball went through i was on the 25 yard line celebrating
8975136 when we got the ball back coach lou hebert told me to get ready and to get my mind straight
8975137 every time wed run a play id kick and i hit them all pretty sweet
8975138 my mouth dried out a lot and i got nervous i couldnt hear the stands at all
8975139 when head coach nelson stokley sent him in you know a 50 yarder on grass is a pretty good hit
8975140 as soon as he struck it it was good you could tell by the thud
8975141 it was very exciting to go down there and do that
8975142 people ask about the kick now and ill talk about it
8975143 the kids at school are kind of amazed when they hear im pushing 40 now so i guess they dont think of guys my age as being athletes
8975144 put this in the news headline fat joe says daddy yankee is a sellout
8975145 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
8975146 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
8975147 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8975148 churn has been endemically high in this industry but its how the carriers work as they almost push them to leaving than trying to keep them
8975149 theyve all had a hard time trying to understand their customers or doing a good job of communication with them
8975150 we seek to provide the kind of service whether thats network coverage products and services or customer service that not only satisfies customers but also makes them likely to recommend us to a family member friend or colleague

8975152 we are incredibly lucky to have a scholar of roberts range at the college
8975153 he draws on a singular combination of linguistic historical and technical skills that together allow him to tackle some of the most difficult and interesting questions in the field additionally his mastery of primary sources in both arabic and hebrew position him for uniquely comparative work and will allow us to offer students a richer inquiry into the history of islam and the history of judaism
8975154 im really looking forward to joining a diverse group of scholars who are doing work that relates to my field and adds to the dialogue
8975155 im sure students who take my classes will enjoy bowdoins new arabic classes or classes on historical perspectives or the contemporary middle east i really enjoy being at a liberal arts college because its about the whole experience
8975156 we have hoped for many years to find someone like robert to anchor a series of courses focused on islamic religious cultures
8975157 ive talked to them about it in our conference we have a lot of respect i believe but were traveling representatives of st ritas and the state of illinois and the chicago catholic league
8975158 you hear about football in texas ohio florida and pennsylvania this is our chance to go out and show that hey were not playing eight man football this is our chance to show ourselves
8975159 its one of those things where everyone wants to see how the illinois teams are going to fare i know huber and lakota arent world beaters but you have to start somewhere
8975160 we told the kids that wed be on tv but with our kids theyre not focused on that
8975161 weve played on local cable channels a camera is a camera theyre not going to see the national audience the biggest thing is preparing for huber heights
8975162 you had to look and say were limited to playing teams from the general area we cant travel to those far places with that rule being rescinded it opens up the door for a lot of things wed love to travel around it takes some time especially being a private catholic school we have money we have to raise but it definitely opens the door
8975163 its just a different tempo between practice and games but after the first two possessions the kids should adjust and all the butterflies should be knocked out
8975164 life as a single mom it isnt easy or is it
8975165 i wrote the book to help women see that yes they can make their dreams come true
8975166 self empowerment confidence and education are what every mom single or married needs to have to succeed for themselves and their family
8975167 the thousands and thousands of essays weve received from working moms pleading for help to pay for college is heartbreaking we are looking for more ways to help them and are thankful we are able to help some moms finally get the education they need to move into the career theyve always wanted
8975168 if i forget you o jerusalem let my right hand forget its skill let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if i fail to recall you if i fail to elevate jerusalem above my foremost joy
8975169 would you like me to set a time when we can go back up north when you have a few days off from the army
8975170 we could go up on a wednesday and come back on sunday and then wed have a few days to do things
8975171 churn has been endemically high in this industry but its how the carriers work as they almost push them to leaving than trying to keep them
8975172 theyve all had a hard time trying to understand their customers or doing a good job of communication with them

8975174 man does not live by bread alone but by what comes from the mouth of god
8975175 the next red line train to alewife is now approaching
8975176 what the city has done in the past is provided the money to the homebuyer and they would actually go out and find a home themselves
8975177 but sometimes they had a difficult time finding a home to buy
8975178 now were taking a pro active approach to ensure that affordable housing is developed throughout the entire city
8975179 i want to express my appreciation for all the hard work that theyve been putting in taking care of the lower part of dyer and chamizal
8975180 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8975181 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8975182 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8975183 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8975184 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8975185 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families
8975186 because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8975187 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8975188 ive never seen anything like it in american politics ive covered politics for more than 30 years across the country and the idea that a politician could bring people together like this is really awe inspiring
8975189 recorded in closets living rooms kitchens attics bathrooms and studios from san franciscos mission district to greenpoint brooklyn to fayette county kentucky the island moved in the storm is none of those places and all of them at once it is a moment of beauty stolen from a fleeting world
8975190 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8975191 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8975192 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8975193 our suspicions were confirmed by staff who told us that following a complaint from a single religious fundamentalist the museum had been instructed to cover up the offending statement
8975194 this is a publicly funded museum and should not be pandering to the growing tide of obscurantism that makes up the creationist movement
8975195 the council of europe is so concerned about the growing pressures of schools to teach creationism in science lessons it has launched an inquiry
8975196 the museum has a duty to uphold science hiding the facts of evolution from children is a form of intellectual child abuse
8975197 the national secular society has offered to pay for a replacement information board with corrected grammar but otherwise unaltered
8975198 he used the same layers of fossils that had supported the genesis view of evolution to show the slow changes that are taking place over the millennia of earth history each small change enabling a species to the rigours of its sic environment the struggle for survival through natural selection leading to the survival of the fittest
8975199 visitors to the museum are entitled to a better explanation of darwins world shaping idea than the bowdlerised version you have on display at present
8975200 there was absolutely no attempt at censorship the text contains a factual error which could cause confusion
8975201 it is disappointing to see that some groups have tried to use this error to further their own agenda and make proverbial mountains out of molehills
8975202 we have now uncovered the display board and are in the process of getting a new board produced
8975203 he used the same layers of fossils to show the slow changes that are taking place over the millennia of earth history each small change enabling a species to adapt to the rigours of its environment the struggle for survival through the natural selection leading to the survival of the fittest
8975204 i welcome the report by my colleagues in the work and pensions select committee
8975205 its not the nicest process to go though i found it quite bizarre and intriguing
8975206 im really saddened a young player of ours put us in that position
8975207 ive seen managers brian little and ronnie moore put an awful lot of time and effort making him into the player he is now with the potential he has
8975208 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8975209 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8975210 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8975211 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8975212 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8975213 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8975214 it just felt so strange to be working alongside him
8975215 at one point i had to yell at him and i never yell at him i usually give him big teddy bear hugs
8975216 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8975217 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8975218 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

8975229 as the leading online travel provider expedia takes care of its customers by providing what they need most protection security flexibility and assistance with all travel needs
8975230 having closed the sale of our u s continuities business we can now fully focus on building relationships with our parent and child customers through our profitable school book clubs book fairs and online businesses
8975231 the distribution agreement with mdg provides us a natural extension and the ability to expand our presence within our extensive international customer base
8975232 we are the clear market leader in the uk for pharmacy stock control systems and we believe this product extension will continue to define jac as the premier medication management systems provider in these markets
8975233 no formular declaraci n alguna de acuerdo con mi punto de vista en relaci n a este tribunal
8975234 este tribunal aparece falsamente como un tribunal de la comunidad internacional cuando es de facto un tribunal de la organizaci n del tratado del atl ntico norte cuyo prop sito es liquidarme
8975235 this proposed project offers timely and economic access for shippers to the u s gulf coast market
8975236 these options offer unparalleled flexibility to shippers and this project reflects our objective to provide our customers with the best transportation solutions available
8975237 this proposal is consistent with bps goals of maximizing value from existing assets and minimizing environmental impacts combined with the construction and operating experience of these two companies the proposed new delivery system will offer shippers the economics predictability and flexibility that are required in this high cost environment also timely redeployment of existing facilities significantly reduces the environmental impact associated with alternative proposed cross country pipelines
8975238 im sure shes trying we havent been off the phone for a second
8975239 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a tate that matters to every one of us
8975240 in alaska governor palin challenged a corrupt system and passed a landmark ethics reform bill she has actually used her veto and cut budgetary spending she put a stop to the bridge to nowhere that would have cost taxpayers 400 million dollars

8975253 a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success
8975254 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8975255 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8975256 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8975257 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8975258 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8975259 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8975260 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8975261 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8975262 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8975263 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8975264 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it
8975265 every time we drill a hole we find the unexpected thats exciting but disturbing
8975266 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8975267 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8975268 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8975269 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8975270 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8975271 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8975272 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8975273 we look forward to the supreme court making the right decision id be kind of disappointed if they didnt but its not a big deal theres always california or massachusetts its not like wed become unmarried
8975274 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8975275 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8975276 if you get home before your wife rather than plop down in front of the tv clean up the house and vacuum the carpets when she walks in and sees you vacuuming she may have a hard time not jumping on you right then and there
8975277 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8975278 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8975279 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8975280 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8975281 they both know how much they have to lose so i dont think that this will last much longer
8975282 we certainly dont want to put ourselves in a situation that we didnt have to be in because i did something silly or we had a mechanical problem
8975283 but at the same time you have to compete at a high level the competition is too tough
8975284 all those people are real good at their jobs and i think theyre probably all going to be very tough
8975285 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8975286 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8975287 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8975288 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8975289 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8975290 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8975291 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8975292 now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
8975293 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8975294 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8975295 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8975296 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8975297 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8975298 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8975299 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy

8975313 ten years ago there was nothing around in this area
8975314 what human beings can achieve and how a city can truly transform itself in 10 years is truly amazing the pace of change is going even faster here in shanghai
8975315 the point with this building has always been how do you get people to the very top
8975316 we always wanted to get people up as high as they can go
8975317 shanghai has just started its true development into transforming itself into a world financial centre
8975318 specially designed to refresh participants on the finer points of providing good customer service as well as provide essential information on the race
8975319 i want what i want and i want it now
8975320 has tremendous confidence in mr lafleys ongoing leadership based in part on his sustained performance and his commitment to strengthen the company for the future
8975321 this reflects that the companys compensation programs are working as described that we pay for performance
8975322 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8975323 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8975324 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8975325 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8975326 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8975327 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
8975328 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
8975329 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
8975330 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
8975331 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
8975332 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
8975333 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
8975334 when you have the name bianca you have a lot of fire power its like the big fuck you

8975339 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8975340 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8975341 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8975342 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8975343 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8975344 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8975345 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8975346 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8975347 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8975348 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8975349 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8975350 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8975351 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8975352 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8975353 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8975354 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8975355 a 20 per cent tax rate would not stand out as particularly low it is still higher than ireland and a number of new member states
8975356 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8975364 based on the low popularity and in an attempt to limit this artificial segregation of code we plan to remove the mpl from the set of licenses on our project hosting service for new projects existing projects will not have to relicense
8975365 our removal of the mpl from the site seemed a little absurd so our bad were putting that option back up for new projects the groups that want to use the mpl to enable their additions extensions and more for firefox and other mozilla projects are legion and considering their recent summit represent a very healthy global collection of developers

8975373 this now makes two new platform storage announcements from ibm where they simply post a web page regarding a completely new storage product on their european site and call it a day
8975374 has ibm decided to focus its marketing efforts elsewhere and decided not to bring much attention to their storage business
8975375 i hope there is a cohesive strategy behind the xiv product but so far im not able to even guess what it might be
8975376 maybe the decades of warfare between geeks and suits has so totally paralyzed the product marketing function that even the normal ibm facade cant cover the cracks it must be something
8975377 to clarify there is no timeline commercialization plan to discuss at this time and were not announcing a specific product
8975378 the board and the department of education are either going to have to increase funding to support the small schools or theyre going to have to come up with some alternatives whether that means joining up a couple of smaller schools im not sure what their decision will be
8975379 our job my job is to do whats best for all 43 schools this is not to say the education kids are getting at smaller schools is a poor education we just cant continue to deliver that quality in the face of declining enrolment
8975380 it just depends on the situation it gives you time for individual attention but also it very much depends on your classroom composition
8975381 it doesnt matter the size of the building or what the building looks like its programs that are offered in the building and its the quality of the education that children get
8975382 theyll be residing in a grade 6 classroom but i think at other times that will mean they are working independently
8975383 i mean its inevitable theres got to be change with declining enrolment
8975384 una ragazza sofferente di un atroce e imbarazzante prurito intimo
8975385 its a difficult draw as any seeded team is going to be a good side but the fact that were away from home first is really important
8975386 the match that would have been the glamour tie and would have given us little chance was valencia
8975387 but i think this one like the three other teams we could have had gives us a chance
8975388 we have to be prepared to win 1 0 over the two legs which isnt the way we normally play but you have to be very strict and disciplined in your defending and you have to take your chances
8975389 being drawn away first gives us a little opportunity to go there keep it tight and maybe not be too ambitious and then to come back here and really play the sort of expansive football were used to playing to try and beat them
8975390 i think that if we play the way we did against dundee united last saturday then we will beat nancy because we played as well then particularly in the second half as we played at any time last season
8975391 our form is there so we have to take that into this tie
8975392 i had 10 years of playing in european football every season and i have to make that count because the players will come up against things in the first game and it can pass you by so quickly
8975393 the best way i can put it is that we have to play in the present not thinking about anything else like what happens in the next leg or what happens if we win lose we score they score we just have to play in the moment
8975394 but i could not be happier with muntari who has made me absolutely forget lampard
8975395 provided gerald decides not to go forward then i think tomas could do a good job for cork
8975396 i have been very impressed with the glen this year if they are looking for a new young coach then i think they couldnt do much better than tom s
8975397 he was a great player for his club and a great captain for cork in his playing days he knows what its all about to win at inter county level and should be given a chance provided he wants it
8975398 having said that if gerald decides he wants to stay in the job then i think he should be given another chance
8975399 he has done a great job and lets not forget a controversial free for waterford potentially cost cork a place in an all ireland final last year

8975401 steven gerrard has had the operation it was not serious but he will not be available until after the international break
8975402 i have spoken today friday to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit
8975403 we had no option but to have the operation done now there will be another international break soon anyway and we could not wait any longer
8975404 the player had problems and we needed to do it straight away we had no choice fabio capello understands this
8975405 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
8975406 the bone doesnt start healing properly for a week or two but were hoping it is looking more five to six weeks rather than eight
8975407 luckily the crack isnt as bad as first thought right now i cant do anything physically but once the bone heals ill do the rehab push on when i can and hopefully ill only have to make up about two weeks worth of training
8975408 i said to kev do you fancy it and he said yep he felt confident but these things happen
8975409 ironically i think johan would have taken it but obviously he was already off injured

8975494 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8975495 this is going to be hilarious its almost as if mccain needed an escape plan and figured palin was the best choice to make that happen let the amusement begin as we watch mccain fumble even greater into absurdity

8975505 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8975506 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8975507 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8975508 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8975509 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids

8975533 once we get settled in well start looking at what we can do
8975534 were hoping somebody steps forward to help us out with that
8975535 theyre really frustrated that their patients have not been able to see them since we left public health
8975536 i think it was a matter of a lot of supporters and a lot of people willing to help us and think of us
8975537 ive been without gas before and i have a generator

8975548 they say having kids at my age either makes you or breaks you and im leaning heavily toward break right now
8975549 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8975550 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8975551 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8975552 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8975553 this is going to be hilarious its almost as if mccain needed an escape plan and figured palin was the best choice to make that happen let the amusement begin as we watch mccain fumble even greater into absurdity
8975554 do you want this woman to be responsible for responding to the likes of vladamir putin
8975555 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8975556 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

8975558 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8975559 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

8975563 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8975564 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8975565 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8975566 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8975567 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8975568 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8975569 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8975570 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8975571 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8975572 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8975573 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it
8975574 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
8975575 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
8975576 im aware of enhanced importance of this issue because of my age
8975577 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
8975578 governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8975579 has tremendous confidence in mr lafleys ongoing leadership based in part on his sustained performance and his commitment to strengthen the company for the future
8975580 this reflects that the companys compensation programs are working as described that we pay for performance
8975581 no no he cant have picked her hed be stupid to pick her no no no no no oh my god
8975582 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8975583 who watched families grow while they were in office there is no reason to believe a woman cant do it with a growing family my baby will not be at all or in any sense neglected
8975584 looking out from his balcony on the 37th story of the palace condominium william pollak enjoys a stellar panoramic view of the brickell skyline
8975585 i think the best word i can use is were just trying to get some closure
8975586 we never want to send anyone out there thats not 100 percent were no more pessimistic about him today than we were but when he goes out there again we want him to be able to pitch with peace of mind
8975587 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8975588 the system will allow much faster analysis of complex problems like understanding and predicting how the power grid behaves one of the most complex engineering systems ever built
8975589 traditional supercomputers are not well suited for certain kinds of data analysis so we want to explore this advanced architecture
8975590 that was the best speed ever reported were getting closer to being able to track the grid in real time
8975591 we have discovered genes implicated in breast cancer using a massively multithreaded algorithm on the cray xmt
8975592 its like finding a needle in a haystack the algorithm searches for genes whose removal quickly causes networks and pathways in the cell to breakdown
8975593 the processors are doing useful work all the time so the computer can be faster
8975594 if all of your microbes move to the other side of the territory it doesnt matter because the threads still have access
8975595 it would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than you to cause one of these little ones to stumble
8975596 the ces negotiates on behalf of all bishops with government and other national bodies on legal administrative and religious education matters in order to promote catholic interests in education safeguard catholic interests in education contribute to christian perspectives within educational debate at national level

8975599 remember ultimately the choice to keep the pregnancy or terminate it is yours listen to other peoples advice and consider financial physical and emotional support networks that you will need whatever your decision but the choice is ultimately yours
8975600 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
8975601 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
8975602 instead of dwelling on specifics obama laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes that republicans mock and the attacks on john mccain that democrats cheer the country saw a candidate confident in his existing campaign formula tie mccain tightly to president bush and remind voters why they are unhappy with the incumbent
8975603 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8975604 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8975605 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8975606 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8975607 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8975608 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8975609 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8975610 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8975611 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8975612 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8975613 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
8975614 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
8975615 im aware of enhanced importance of this issue because of my age
8975616 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
8975617 governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8975618 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8975619 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8975620 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8975621 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8975622 registro nico de defensa de las v ctimas de delitos contra la integridad sexual
8975623 habla de la manera en que vivimos de cambiar en la mente de todos el odio por amor
8975624 la m sica es mi proyecto de vida y quiero quedarme ah para siempre
8975625 la actuaci n no es algo con lo que yo est interesado
8975626 acabo de acordar escribir una pel cula para sony y el productor scott rudin sobre c mo se invent facebook
8975627 pens que un buen primer paso en mi preparaci n ser a descubrir qu es facebook as que he creado esta p gina
8975628 he visto que hay mucha gente por ah utilizando mi nombre en perfiles de facebook lo cual me halaga m s que me asusta pero el que escribe aqu soy yo
8975629 no s c mo puedo demostr roslo pero sent os libres de ponerme a prueba
8975630 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8975631 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8975632 and biden will not be able to attack her lack of experience without highlighting obamas equal lack of experience
8975633 she went ahead with her last chilbirth even though she knew the baby had down syndrome obama would kill that baby now
8975634 as for the prospect of her being vice president palin told kudlow that she could not answer the question of whether she wanted the job
8975635 hey lookee here i gots me a woman on my ticket i aint no racist or sexist
8975636 if the vp has to step up at president for some reason 44 year old governor of alaska for 2 years sarah palin will be president of the united states this is what republicans wanted
8975637 seg n los datos preliminares de que disponemos creemos que este a o el agujero en la capa de ozono estar en los niveles medios
8975638 this would be a pretty shrewd pick but one not without risk
8975639 how will she perform in the debate with sen biden on foreign policy he has a command of foreign policy details that few people in washington have she will have to cram like its her college finals
8975640 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics gov palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
8975641 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
8975642 shes an nra national rifle association lifetime member shes a right to life feminist she has every credential as a conservative she is young she exciting shes a mom with five kids
8975643 the huge gamble is that john mccain is 72 hes had a couple of bouts with cancer
8975644 did i listen to pop music because i was miserable or was i miserable because i listened to pop music
8975645 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
8975646 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8975647 to respect the condition because it is a serious disorder and we wanted to respect it we also watched some documentaries and a couple other things the sex stuff wasnt hard just goofy i remember cumming in the camera at four in the morning for a close up of me having an orgasm and i couldnt stop laughing
8975648 gee how long do i have how about the event where queues and queues of waiters came in with enormous bruises and then vomited clam chowder on my lectern and threw dinner rolls that was just one kind of smallish thing thats happened but its usually a variety of that
8975649 to be confirmed in the catholic church where i grew up you had to work as candy striper at our lady of lords hospital
8975650 the theme of the book is things not being what they appear to be when i was writing it a group of public school teachers told me there was a new announcement to watch out for recess will be held in the library and when you heard that you had to turn out the lights make the students lie down on the floor and lock the windows and doors until they announce the lunch special is tuna noodle casserole because recess will be held in the library means that theres a school shooter killing people in the hallways and the all clear is tuna noodle casserole and i was struck by these fantastically evil awful things being portrayed in such banal language and how do we talk about things we cant talk about
8975651 church used to be that place where people could risk going and presenting their absolute worst self once a week and be heard by people who would accept you back through communion into the community
8975652 then church became that place where people went just to look good and you didnt get that release of looking bad once a week in a way the support groups and 12 step groups and phone sex chat lines all these contexts in which people present their worst selves and find a community despite their behavior these have become the new church these are the new escape valves where people go and confess and are redeemed by their peers
8975653 it could be a cross between west side story and rent
8975654 the official chinese position if it were pushed would be that this is unacceptable
8975655 china doesnt want to give the green light to somebody coming to the side of separatist forces within their troubled regions
8975656 china will not abstain china is not going to go for something overturning a sovereign government and a sovereign rule
8975657 its just not going to happen as chinas position on taiwan would go down the drain
8975658 if the resolution is focused on the question of sovereignty china may very well side with the west
8975659 but china will do its upmost to avoid such a resolution being presented to the security council because it doesnt want to damage its relationship with russia
8975660 it is always possible that the western countries will force a vote and if it happens i think china will abstain
8975661 thats not in chinas interest as it has in the past managed to get some influence in central asia and china and russia both cooperate and compete in the region for influence
8975662 youre looking for an elmer the safety elephant to be scolding you from the side its organized chaos
8975663 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8975664 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality

8975670 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive

8975673 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it
8975674 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8975675 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8975676 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8975677 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8975678 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8975679 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
8975680 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
8975681 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
8975682 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
8975683 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
8975684 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
8975685 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
8975686 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8975687 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

8975696 how long can obamas campaign run on hate of bush most voters dont harbor and nurture that hate
8975697 bushs decisions in office have protected us from a second major attack
8975698 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8975727 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution
8975728 he would show us fossils and say how old do you think these are
8975729 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8975730 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
8975731 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
8975732 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
8975733 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
8975734 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
8975735 there is something about kim theres a strength with her leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch there are moments on the screen when shes shaking her entire body is shaking for real you couldnt act that
8975736 it will be necessary to be fortiter in re suaviter in modo
8975737 but there was in store a still greater victory of the political economy of labour over the political economy of property
8975738 at the same time the experience of the period from 1848 to 1864 has proved beyond doubt what the most intelligent leaders of the english working class already maintained in 1851 52 regarding the co operative movement that however excellent in principle and however useful in practice co operative labour if kept within the narrow circle of the casual efforts of private workmen will never be able to arrest the growth in geometrical proportion of monopoly to free the masses nor even to perceptibly lighten the burden of their miseries
8975739 to conquer political power has therefore become the great duty of the working classes
8975740 conditions for socialism are absent because the level of consciousness of the masses is too low
8975741 the so called relations of distribution are themselves relations of production
8975742 thus although money owes its existence only to the tendency of exchange value to separate itself from the substance of commodities and to take on a pure form nevertheless commodities cannot be directly transformed into money i e the authentic certificate of the amount of labour time realized in the commodity cannot serve the commodity as its price in the world of exchange values
8975743 which is independent of the knowing and willing of individuals and which presupposes their reciprocal independence and indifference
8975744 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe it must nestle everywhere settle everywhere establish connections everywhere
8975745 the bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country to the great chagrin of reactionists it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood all old established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed they are dislodged by new industries whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe in place of the old wants satisfied by the production of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal inter dependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8975746 the degree and the universality of the development of wealth where
8975747 rooted in the condition that every human being has the same category the same value and the same rights includes every individual independently of the type of activity he carries out
8975748 every individual independently of the type of activity he carries out
8975749 thus in modern times it has been demonstrated ad nauseam that princes are generally unhappy on their thrones in consideration of which the possession of a throne is tolerated and men acquiesce in the fact that not themselves but the personages in question are its occupants
8975750 eight years after the death of ricardo john gray developed the doctrine of wage money as the realization of the right to the integral product of labour created by robert owen into a coherent system after having assured the labour time spent a central bank issues certificates that refer to one hours labour one days labour one weeks labour and which are valid as payment for a product requiring the same amount of labour this consistent comparison of the value of a product with the amount of labour time contained in each product deduces from the theory of labour the exact measure that ricardo was looking for and it is also in agreement with the theory of adam smith who says in his main work of equal quantities of work it can be said that in all places and at all times it is of equal value to the worker
8975751 every man has an undoubted right to all that his honest labour can procure him when he thus appropriates the fruits of his labour he commits no injustice upon any other human being for he interferes with no other mans right of doing the same with the produce of his labour
8975752 from the very nature of labour and exchange strict justice not only requires that all exchangers should be mutually but that they should likewise be equally benefited men have only two things which they can exchange with each other namely labour and the produce of labour
8975753 if a just system of exchanges were acted upon the value of articles would be determined by the entire cost of production and equal values should always exchange for equal values
8975754 the whole transaction therefore plainly shows that the capitalists and proprietors do no more than give the working man for his labour of one week a part of the wealth which they obtained from him the week before which amounts to giving him nothing for something
8975755 the whole transaction therefore between the producer and the capitalist is a palpable deception a mere farce it is in fact in thousands of instances no other than a barefaced though legalized robbery
8975756 it is plain that establish whatever form of government we will we may talk of morality and brotherly love no reciprocity can exist where there are unequal exchanges inequality of exchanges as being the cause of inequality of possessions is the secret enemy that devours us
8975757 where equal exchanges are maintained the gain of one man cannot be the loss of another for every exchange is then simply a
8975758 the principle of equal exchanges therefore must from its very nature ensure universal labour
8975759 in principle there is no exchange of products but there is the exchange of the labour which co operated in production
8975760 but the respectable conscience refuses to see this obvious fact
8975761 mr bray turns the illusion of the respectable bourgeois into an ideal he would like to attain in a purified individual exchange freed from all the elements of antagonism he finds in it he sees an equalitarian relation which he would like society to adopt generally
8975762 mr bray does not see that this equalitarian relation this corrective ideal that he would like to apply to the world is itself nothing but the reflection of the actual world and that therefore it is totally impossible to reconstitute society on the basis of what is merely an embellished shadow of it in proportion as this shadow takes on substance again we perceive that this substance far from being the transfiguration dreamt of is the actual body of existing society
8975763 in other words the idea of equal exchange is not the recipe for a new socialist society but only an attempt to modify the existing economic relations of capitalism while retaining its essence exchange of commodities it is the eternal dream of the petty bourgeois
8975764 uh this doesnt look too good it looks too crowded
8975765 im pkw bereich wird china die usa noch vor 2015 als gr ten markt der welt abl sen

8975767 the fact that it has a global skills shortage for directly qualified people and its only getting 8 000 acceptances illustrates the problem it has people think its full of dull people with no personality
8975768 both the prime minister and the house speaker have agreed that this is the best solution to solve the current situation
8975769 opening a general debate will enable everybody to express their opinion

8975787 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
8975788 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8975789 a little flat and not just because of its now required state of the union laundry list passages
8975790 the stupidity of it that somehow the idea that it is all over in northern ireland and there is no need for an envoy this of all things
8975791 its hard for me to fathom how anyone who knows anything about ireland would say this this is a signal that the u s government will detach if he obama wins the operative word is detachment
8975792 senator john mccain has selected alaska gov sarah palin to be his running mate according to us republican party sources
8975793 huge contrasts found between uk nations patients in the uks four nations have dramatically different experiences of the nhs
8975794 dr nick goodwin from the kings fund health think tank said the data should be interpreted with caution as it is collected differently in each area he also warned that the data did not take in to account existing health inequalities or the infrastructure in place before different policies were adopted by each government
8975795 mr robinson said he wanted an immediate executive meeting to deal with the issue before it becomes a matter for the courts
8975796 i dont think its involves any deep seated policy differences
8975797 im told of around 150 changes many involve references to northern ireland being changed to the north
8975798 basically once a document is passed by the executive then thats it it should be put out in that form
8975799 ultimately it could go to the courts but i think its more a case of symbolising the bad relations there are at the moment
8975800 i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on

8975802 the coalition on sexual orientation coso contributed to the 2007 and 2008 belfast gay pride parade awarding 5 750 and 5 000 from a fund of 230 000 which was awarded by the previous direct rule administration
8975803 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8975804 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8975805 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8975806 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8975807 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8975808 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8975809 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8975810 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8975811 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8975812 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8975813 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8975814 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8975815 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8975816 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8975817 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8975818 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8975819 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8975820 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8975821 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8975822 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8975823 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8975825 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8975826 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8975827 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8975828 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8975829 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8975836 i thoroughly enjoyed the film all the deeper facets this is a kick ass thought provoking movie that almost demands multiple viewings under the ravens wing was such an interesting and thought provoking tale its hard to find fault with it 5 cans out of 5
8975837 under the ravens wing is a striking film that fascinates as it entertains
8975838 the best acting ive seen in a low budget film ever
8975839 the cast here really hits the nail on the head and everyone turns in a top notch performance the characters are realistically based with good background and pretty good dialogue
8975840 under the ravens wing uses an interesting story structure and varied visually compelling style the performances are strong particularly that of kimberly amato all the way to its disturbing yet satisfying ending

8975852 we are hugely relieved to be able to get back to working directly with children and their families in zimbabwe for five months we have been stuck in our offices unable to reach thousands of children who have been struggling to survive in extremely difficult conditions
8975853 our teams are already returning to the field and will be back out among communities on monday its impossible to know how bad the situation has got until were on the ground although our local partners have confirmed our fears of increased rates of malnutrition among children
8975854 we also know that thousands of children have had to drop out of school in order to try and find food for their families we fear some girls will have been forced into prostitution and that others will have been pushed into early marriage with their families unable to look after them
8975855 this aid vacuum has been disastrous for children who are always the most vulnerable in an emergency over the next few weeks our teams will be working flat out to respond to the urgent needs of families including assessing numbers in need of food aid getting the poorest children back to school and helping families prepare for the next planting season
8975856 hyper inflation together with soaring food and fuel costs have made zimbabwe an incredibly difficult working environment for aid agencies we have to get all our supplies and materials from outside the country and getting what we need is hugely expensive
8975857 however save the children has been working in zimbabwe for nearly 25 years through a number of crises and whatever the situation our one aim is to get help to the millions of children who need it this is an aim we can once again achieve

8975900 questioning in the sense of wow who is she and excitement about the idea wow this is going to be an interesting feature of the convention
8975901 the question is how is she going to come across to the american public can she be soldas someone with executive experience
8975902 it surely makes sense that she has to prove herself if speeches at conventions are always important in one sense wow is this one going to be important
8975903 she is a game changer one way or the other
8975904 when you think about where this election is going to be decided and how people are going to decide there is a large upside if they can be convinced she is competent to be potentially president of the united states
8975905 if they cant be this will be a disaster for mccain
8975906 it certainly signifies the importance of ohio in this election and sen mccains commitment to campaign in every region of the state between now and november

8975913 i am not surprised that its a plank in the platform because thats part of mccains platform but its disappointing because its an example of republicans playing me too rather than leading
8975914 i wouldnt say there has been a shift just within the party
8975915 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8975916 i really believe there are things nobody would see if i didnt photograph them
8975917 i guess this republican will now vote democrat i absolutely abhor palin i certainly pray that if mccain is by some chance elected that he doesnt become incapacitated somehow and she has to run the country granted she is better than hillary but not by much this republican says vote democrat go obama

8976424 this is a win win agreement that provides significant benefits to fortune brands
8976425 in exchange for accelerating the end of our u s distribution agreement with absolut well receive a cash payment of 230 million were also pleased that well acquire a fast growing premium rum brand rum is one of the most attractive spirits categories and the addition of cruzan fills a portfolio gap in premium rum with the categorys fastest growing brand in the u s
8976426 importantly by transitioning to a dedicated sales force focused solely on our brands well simplify our route to market in the u s and enjoy greater control over our distribution
8976427 our seven year partnership with absolut served its purpose but our spirits business is a much bigger company today with the scale and leading positions in key spirits categories to fully leverage the strengths of a dedicated sales force
8976428 we believe moving forward now with this distribution solution will provide valuable clarity and sharper focus to our sales force and will better support beam globals vision of building brands people want to talk about
8976429 this transaction serves shareholders significantly better than allowing the distribution partnership to expire in 2012
8976430 the termination payment from pernod more than compensates for our higher costs of distribution over the remaining term of the joint venture agreement
8976431 we welcome fortune brands and beam global to the u s virgin islands
8976432 we look forward to working with them in the years ahead to grow the cruzan rum brand and to continue to explore new and cooperative ways for the government to assist in the development of the rum industry in the territory

8976614 im very pleased with the players i thought on sunday at colchester in the pro40 was one of our best performances
8976615 and this has got to be one of our best performances in the championship
8976616 we want to finish strong theres still a chance of going up but we know were going to have to win two or three of our last three matches
8976617 we dont have the resources or time to add a fourth race to the launch of starcraft ii but im sure in the event that we decide to do an expansion set its a feature thatll come up for discussion we talked about the possibility of a fourth race early on but we felt like we had a finite amount of great ideas and wanted to make sure we focused all the cool best ideas on the existing three races rather than diluting those ideas across four races

8976634 we had a rash of rain storms at 4 p m and that hurt attendance
8976635 there is no doubt we faced some tough weather especially in may and early june
8976636 it was clear to us that there will not be any new product coming into moraine
8976637 they are not saying no and they are continuing to meet with us
8976638 its a long shot we understand that but we are still in the game until they say the game is over
8976639 well mr teager speaking for myself i find it surprising that bearing in mind the period since the original indictment and the significance in the life and to the life of this tribunal of this particular case that you tell me now that its only once the accused is in custody that this exercise is undertaken i am surprised i will say no more than that at this stage and i sincerely hope you are not serious about that date
8976640 i want to know what is happening with my submissions the ones in which i expressed my doubts about the possibility of holding this trial at all because of the many errors made and also because i am deeply convinced that this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me

8976645 wayne and i kind of touch base with each other as 6 year olds at a tryout in a rink in ayr ontario which was just a little shack
8976646 i was half decent and obviously he was very good and we made the team together and then we started playing together and we hit it off as friends
8976647 then it was the outdoor rink with wally gretzky at the gretzkys house i kind of knew he was kind of special right from the get go he was playing way ahead of himself so it was special and the good thing about me and him we played hockey together then once hockey was over we went right to baseball and we were pretty good baseball players too
8976648 it is a lot bigger in our minds than it really was he had the floodlights the cones the real steel nets which were hard to get in those days and it was a lot of competition and skill on that little rink late at night sometimes it was just wayne and myself and wally a lot of great memories
8976649 i was always trying to chase the puck trying to get the puck off him what was pretty amazing as a 6 year old not many kids could stickhandle with their head up and go down the ice and carry the puck he could at that age
8976650 as a matter of fact i remembered him playing in edmonton i was in oshawa still and he came back in his ferrari and picked me up
8976651 we were still playing junior baseball he was playing in the nhl his first year oilers owner peter pocklington got him a ferrari that he never drove i remember him picking me up taking me to cockshutt park to play for the braves
8976652 he went his separate way when he was 13 going on 14
8976653 he moved to toronto but up until we were 12 we were pretty good rink players in the back what was amazing is we played so much hockey we played on two teams quite a bit we played every night on the rink come april april to september we never went to hockey schools or anything we did that stuff during the season
8976654 obviously i havent had the best of luck with teams and their longevity
8976655 i come out to long beach at the tail end of a topsy turvy 10 year run
8976656 its a pretty good job thats for sure its been a great organization for 10 years im pretty excited about it
8976657 he fits right into the plan here and what were trying to do
8976658 the first year i took over texas it was really tough
8976659 it was a hockey wasteland they finished dead last the previous two seasons that they played and the missed a season with a hurricane i worked nonstop to really get a competitive team that first year last year it was quite a bit easier because they had a good ahl affiliation only an hour away in houston we had a lot of success in terms of moving guys up to the ahl but this is a new level here in florida
8976660 its the instant recognition you get from agents and players
8976661 it gets their attention right away with the success that theyve had in terms of attendance facilities and in terms of longevity in success on the ice that gets you in the door right away no 2 it is southwest florida its a tremendous place to live and no 3 you have the two affiliations with the carolina hurricanes there have been a number of success stories to come through here this is a destination where you can move up
8976662 i did go down to fort myers during the year last year and it was a nice place to be that also helped out in my consideration in what i was going to do if we could win a lot of games that would be great
8976663 its a pretty good job thats for sure its been a great organization for 10 years im pretty excited about it
8976664 ross was a real priority for me last year in texas
8976665 he won a national championship and came from a very high profile hockey program in wisconsin he was a little bit more mature than most college guys coming out at the age of 25 hes just a tremendously versatile hockey player hes somebody who thinks the game on a different level than most players in our league hes such an intelligent player
8976666 ive put tremendous pressure on myself every year to try and win a championship
8976667 i think the best coaches in our league are the ones that strive for that excellence i think the pressures both internal and external in this job and were hired to win a hockey game i dont think it matters where youre at im sure the fans expect a lot here and they should because this is a model franchise and they have made the playoffs for 10 straight years i put that pressure on myself in texas where they hadnt had any on ice success to win thats what keeps you motivated
8976668 im goal and career oriented like everybody else but you cant put a time frame on when you think its going to happen or hope that its going to happen sometimes the best opportunities just kind of drop out of the sky i think if you continue to do two things at our level win and move players up to the american hockey league you keep yourself on the radar thats my goal again this year

8976672 every time a couple makes love they release a hormone in their bodies called oxytocin
8976673 oxytocin is released when men and women have an orgasm and it bonds them to each other its one of the reasons why sex outside marriage will always always hurt because youre bonding yourselves to each other not just temporarily but biologically there is something happening in your bodies that is going to make it really really hurt if the bond isnt carried forward
8976674 gov palin in alaska has done a lot of things barack obama claims he wants to do

8976685 the system will allow much faster analysis of complex problems like understanding and predicting how the power grid behaves one of the most complex engineering systems ever built

8976795 however once the species are distinguished anyone can use the dna barcode to rapidly and accurately identify one of them

8976802 this may have stifled efforts at developing newer and better vaccines especially for use in the elderly

8976962 what then is the job of the manager of those frontline people
8976963 i would love to be able to give you a list of steps for becoming level 5 but we have no solid research data that would support a credible list
8976964 to the death a striking feature of level 5 leaders was their willingness to accept full responsibility for any mistakes they made and to use the experience as an occasion to learn level 5 leaders at the same time were quick to attribute success to luck or to the exceptional capacities of the people involved rather than massaging their own egos the good to great companies also never lost sight of faith in their capacity to find a way forward this is about the healthy management of emotions and feelings people who can manage their emotions are able to distinguish between the feelings of the emotion and honour those feelings but at the same time recognise the reasons that lie behind the feelings they are then able to take steps by using the energy of the emotion to deal with the reasons they use their emotions as reliable indicators of the steps they must take its part of facing the brutal facts the hedgehog concept simplicity within three circles the hedgehog concept is an intriguing title for one of the steps in moving from good to great collins draws upon a parable created by isaiah berlin who contrasted the hedgehog and the fox the hedgehog had a simple strategy and tactic to stay safe while the fox had all the cunning and guile in the world but the fox could not outwit the hedgehog collins makes the point that all the good to great companies were hedgehogs they all developed a hedgehog concept

8976968 the impact on this river is real and its pronounced but its not so heavy that that the river is beyond saving
8976969 we have a unique moment in time to preserve as much of it as we can as it is
8976970 so what youre looking at is municipalities small in size that do not have the expertise and the staff to properly plan for and address this extremely rapid growth
8976971 is indicative of a river thats challenged in terms of water supply
8976972 we just have to have the grace and wisdom not to repeat the mistakes made in other parts of the state
8976973 im not going to go in there they probably sprinkle weird brain stuff in your ice cream and then see what happens to you after you eat it
8976974 it is therefore permissible to celebrate the sacrifice of the mass following the typical edition of the roman missal promulgated by bl
8976975 e ach catholic priest of the latin rite whether secular or regular may use the roman missal published by bl
8976976 for such celebrations the priest has no need for permission from the apostolic see or from his ordinary
8976977 i would like to draw attention to the fact that this missal was never juridically abrogated and consequently in principle was always permitted
8976978 the results for the half year are of course disappointing
8976979 however new notebooks are now launching with significantly reduced production costs which should begin to lift gross margins this quarter
8976980 we believe dell can recapture a portion of the pricing related margin miss but view the mix and accounting changes as ongoing
8976981 while everyone celebrates labor day we have foxwoods management repeatedly violating our rights as if it is above the law foxwoods should obey the law and sit down with us and negotiate a contract
8976982 while we believe the earnings guidance is likely to put some short term pressure on the stock we do not believe it should overshadow the companys longer term growth prospects which in our opinion are still quite solid
8976983 in an uncertain and challenging environment the implementation of the operational action plan we announced in july makes me confident that we will achieve our 2008 objectives
8976984 there are and there will be rumors but my priority today is to deliver on the results for 2008
8976985 theres a whole series of our vehicles full seized trucks and some cross overs that have a heated windshield washer system
8976986 the circuit board apparently can short and normally what happens is theres smoke and the system doesnt work but in rare cases there could be a fire
8976987 in rare instances a fire can occur so we want to make sure that our customers are safe
8976988 its a very simple and fast fix and it really isnt all that inconvenient to them especially this time of year

8976993 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
8976994 im not sure if its in direct competition with traditional mediums its more of a place where things can take on a life of their own after being seen first on mainstream tv or get noticed like say the georgia high school clip and then end up being popular content on mainstream tv

8977041 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8977042 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
8977043 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8977044 we are very happy that the judge in this case recognized our compliance with the dmca and our efforts to respect copyrights
8977045 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8977046 i was able to get the music firsthand from people who had emigrated from europe before and after the war
8977047 i played a lot of bar mitzvahs and jewish weddings
8977048 i started to listen and hear people experimenting with their own music
8977049 the original idea was to make a band that you would find in 1930s or 40s cuba when there were more jews still in cuba i was always exploring and experimenting doing new things
8977050 i am just now starting to tap more into that cuban connection
8977051 that is one thing i notice people arent doing enough of these days
8977052 there is an unsettling feeling that people cant move from their jobs because they dont want to lose the security or insurance we are not being risk takers and i miss that
8977053 if you are not happy where you are jump on it and just go if you believe in what you do and what you want and seek it out youll find it
8977054 the fact that it has a global skills shortage for directly qualified people and its only getting 8 000 acceptances illustrates the problem it has people think its full of dull people with no personality
8977055 and superior in that the offensive smell of infusions was eliminated
8977056 as they capture mosquitoes that have had a blood meal and thus more opportunity to become infected
8977057 each female mosquito has the potential to produce about 200 eggs and she can have as many as five cycles so when we capture a gravid mosquito that can remove as many as 500 females
8977058 sampling the species in urban environments has been a challenge until studies on its oviposition cues allowed the development of gravid female traps that collect mostly females that previously have blood fed and therefore had a chance to become infected
8977059 i kind of expected mccains pick was not going to be something that was going to be the conventional pick knowing him the way i know him it was going to be an out of the box type of selection and this caught everybody by surprise
8977060 her name wasnt mentioned it came down to the tim pawlentys the mitt romneys but i think that whatever bounce the obama campaign gets and they will its going to be deflated quickly with sarah palin when shes introduced
8977061 last night senator barack obama had a chance to address all the sexism and misogyny that was leveled in this campaign against hillary clinton and he chose not to take that
8977062 so in terms of sitting well with women on the democratic side we see that john mccain gets it john mccain selected a qualified woman with a lot of experience and accomplishments to be his running mate as opposed to barack obama who chose against the person that got more votes than anyone in history so i think that thats actually whats sitting poorly with women right now
8977063 actually when you look at sarah palin you see that she is a family woman shes a mother of five you see that in alaska she has an incredibly strong record as a reformer
8977064 so i think thats where peoples concern is going to be that its a person with accomplishment and experience whos been chosen she just happens to be a woman as well
8977065 i have received my item but it is less valuable than described
8977066 la acci n violenta y represiva tuvo dos fuentes primarias una de ellas la polic a nacional y la segunda vertiente de la represi n y barbarie provino de algunos que estoy seguro que eran los guardaespaldas o fuerzas de choque del movimiento del presidente rafael correa

8977088 the convention exemplifies the true rot of our democracy the presidential race gets almost all of the attention and every other level of government gets none because we have come to believe democracy is just a quadrennial vote for president

8977099 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8977100 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8977101 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8977102 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8977103 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8977104 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8977105 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8977106 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it

8977113 governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8977114 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
8977115 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
8977116 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
8977117 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
8977118 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance
8977119 yea well we hope you are stupid enough to fall for it

8977128 i got dragged along to a normal church when i was a kid and my opinion was that it was irrelevant and it frustrated me that they acted all holy on a sunday and then we knew how they lived on a monday
8977129 this is going to be the grooviest funkiest church in scotland with multi media and a contemporary presentation
8977130 who appeared to come from across the street where the basilica of the assumption is located though they dont know if he came out of the church itself he was white and well dressed in his thirties and stared at the display before leaving the range of the camera where he picked up a rock from construction and threw it at the window this doesnt seem to be a random act of vandalism he seemed deeply perturbed by the poster i would like to think that the catholic church with its rich colorful 2 000 years of history going straight back to jesus need not be threatened by a history book
8977131 so far discussion has centered around my not published book which almost no one has read soon i hope we will address the text itself in published form and my ideas derived from research and experience of moderate islam as a religion of egalitaranism and yes peace
8977132 i would like to think that the catholic church with its rich colorful 2 000 years of history going straight back to jesus need not be threatened by a history book
8977133 unfortunately books are often seen as a threat to youth to politicians to religions we all recall the death threats heaped on salman rushdie after the satanic verses was published and just this month random house acknowledged pulling sherry jones debut novel the jewel of medina about muhammad and his child bride because of fears of violence

8977148 for all intents and purposes theres not a whole lot we can do now
8977149 it really is sad because theres a lot of really smart guys out there who really dont enjoy their jobs anymore thats too bad
8977150 but the building of the car things we used to take a lot of pride in a lot of that is gone
8977151 and theyre just making it worse theres more rules coming out for next year
8977152 and we can see right now that the sport is struggling as it is
8977153 and the people complaining and whining and just absolutely horrible stories that have been written from time to time about people its made nascar say ok we dont want to have a bad light on our sport so were going to make it where you cant do anything and its sad
8977154 i dont think its any different now than in past years every year the rulebook gets thicker
8977155 a lot of the legislation is to maintain a level playing field for the competitors

8977164 didnt you know there is saint who has come to our village from afar and several of us are going to meet him

8977202 as far as the horse industry goes i think its started coming back
8977203 the people who were really interested in getting their stuff back together again have done so there are still whole empty neighborhoods large acres of empty neighborhoods some people still havent even gutted their houses

8977206 a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the northern gulf coast
8977207 they are moving like this hurricane is breathing down our throat because of the contraflow
8977208 in the past we wouldnt be moving these horses until the weekend until we figure out if the storm is actually heading our way and then wed haul back and forth all night to get the horses out of here
8977209 if we see something open mouthed with a long tongue and teeth coming at us we can get out in just a few hours but my horses are gone
8977210 at this time we are making preparations locally to respond to the effects of a potential hurricane early next week
8977211 in regard to external or state response involving the school of veterinary medicine we are in communication with the louisiana state animal response team and working cooperatively with them to identify and publicize available boarding facilities for horses and small animals while identifying potential volunteers that will be readily available to assist where needed
8977212 the lsu school of veterinary medicine is not an animal shelter but may incur a wave of animals in need of veterinary care

8977231 there are government funds churches social services and insurance which pay for the medical needs of adults and children but when a family pet needs treatment there really isnt a lot of outside support or sympathy for that matter

8977317 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8977318 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8977319 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8977320 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8977321 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8977322 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8977323 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8977324 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8977325 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it

8977333 there is hardly any chance that musharraf will ever be tried in pakistan
8977334 hes laughed off the reports that he is about to leave the country
8977335 he said im not going anywhere im staying in pakistan
8977336 imam moussa al sadr was a major turning point for shiites in lebanon he moved them from isolation and marginalization to uprising
8977337 all shiite resistance groups and movements were triggered by imam slogans
8977338 i will not rest until there is no deprived person or a deprived area in lebanon
8977339 because hes argentinian there are going to be comparisons with lionel messi diego maradona riquelme and people like that
8977340 but rightly so because he can be like that if he wants to be hopefully hell go on and be a superstar hes got the potential to be one
8977341 i thought he was magnificent tonight and so exciting to watch players like that put bums on seats they fill a stadium
8977342 hes the type of player you do love to play with because you know theres going to be an end product from him
8977343 and you know when you give him the ball that hes going to do something special
8977344 the thing for him now is to keep his feet on the ground because hes still very young
8977345 but hopefully he can keep progressing the way he is
8977346 the skys the limit for him if he keeps going the way he is
8977347 its up to us older heads to keep his feet on the ground and to not let the praise and furore around him get to his head but hes not the kind of kid that will
8977348 hes the kind of kid that will want to keep improving
8977349 weve got a team set up to do what he wants basically but hes got to do his job coming back and to be fair he does
8977350 he got a bit of criticism recently after the defeat at sheffield united but hes taken that on board and hes produced the goods
8977351 i think the fans who came to watch us will have been very very pleased with his performance tonight
8977352 hes got no restraint on him at all hes just a young man who wants to go out and play football
8977353 hes a very gifted kid he pops up on places that hurt people he plays wide right but turns up in pockets where defenders dont want to go and pick him up and hes got a decent left peg his dead ball deliveries and shooting are very very good
8977354 there might be times this year when he starts to feel the pace but hes doing great and hes a lovely kid
8977355 it is a surprise how quickly he has settled in but from minute one hes let it be known that he wants to take corners penalties throw ins everything hes a very confident kid but hes lovable with it so you dont mind
8977356 weve had to tell him to calm down at times but he listens to you and i think hell be a very very good footballer
8977357 we just want to give him time to settle in and enjoy his football
8977358 we dont have to wait until the summer to sign him but we have him for a year and dont have to worry about anyone else signing him theres no need to rush
8977359 we have a few young players we just want to gel together and be happy here were focused on that for now
8977360 it was a good all round performance from us against a good doncasterside so were very happy with that
8977361 at sheffield united we got caught cold and conceded two early goals this time that happened to doncaster and they couldnt get back into the game which was exactly what happened to us at bramall lane
8977362 the rangers fans arent stupid they know a good player when they see one so its no surprise the fans have taken to them
8977363 it could have taken time for them to settle in a foreign country but theyve come in the boys here have helped them along the way played well and theyre going to be a great asset for us this season
8977364 its a hard shift on your own up front everyone knows that but if i can do the job of two people up there it allows people from midfield to get on the ball more and dictate the game
8977365 its for the team if we can win games with me playing up front on my own then so be it
8977366 its a tough position but i got great support from dani parejo emmanuel ledesma and lee cook so at times it was like we had three or four up front it wasnt like i was isolated
8977367 everyones in the team for their attributes some might be more creative than others and some might just be destroyers it all combines for the team performance
8977368 the target is promotion and everyone at the club believes we can do it
8977369 i love paula wagner but she wants to produce elsewhere and in her own venue and i dont intend to stand in her way ill say this of her leaving united artists whatever paula wants is what i want her to have and i hope well continue working together on future projects
8977370 its original its suspenseful the writers chris mcquarrie and nathan alexander are just great and i cant say enough good things about the director bryan singer i first met him at the mission impossible premiere and weve been hoping to work together ever since
8977371 things are going really well for katie and well see you on opening night sept 18th
8977372 more than an indoor soccer league the xsx is an energetic and innovative 12 month experience built around skilled soccer professionals entertainment and fan participation both live and online
8977373 i enjoyed every minute at newcastle it was a fantastic club i enjoyed working with the manager and they are a great bunch of lads
8977374 but i knew offers had come in over the summer and the club had turned them down and the valuation of me wasnt reflected in the deal i was on
8977375 speaking to them i felt it was the right thing to put in a transfer request to show how i felt seeing as they didnt think they were on the same wavelength as me and they then made the decision to sell me
8977376 it was newcastles decision and now i am at aston villa a new contract was never discussed that was a source of frustration
8977377 i nearly signed two years ago that was a tough time for me and villa as well it obviously threw their plans into turmoil that was a tough time
8977378 you learn from that and you move on and two years later i am sure i am a stronger character and a better player for those experiences
8977379 the fee had been agreed i came down here to the training ground and got into the managers office and he said he had a phone call to say newcastle had changed their mind
8977380 at first i didnt know if it was the managers humor and whether he was joking with me but it wasnt a joke that is in the past and it is how you react to those sort of things
8977381 the best way i know is to get my head down and work hard i went back to newcastle and did as well as i could
8977382 he has been fantastic with me all the way through i had a great relationship with him learnt a lot and wish him every luck
8977383 we talked a few times and last night once the fee had been agreed he wished me every luck in the world and that is it basically
8977384 things change quickly in football all i know is the offer has been accepted and im a villa player now and the newcastle chapter is ended
8977385 if teams can sell naming rights to buildings entryways and portals why not for my seats
8977386 they could block a seat cover but if he wore a jacket that says joes mortuary on the back of it and drapes it over his seat they couldnt block that
8977387 i think the jets will have to take a hard look at letting me do this but they cant afford any more bad publicity
8977388 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari
8977389 i felt like it was cheaper to build the space and pay the interest costs
8977390 if i dont get them leased in the next 18 to two year period then i made a mistake
8977391 i wanted housetops to help my center more than i wanted money off the land
8977392 its put us back a year in the growth pattern of the center but the center keeps growing every year
8977393 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
8977394 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
8977395 i didnt get excited until i read about documents being available and then blocked
8977396 that set all kinds of alarm bells in my head in terms of going and finding records it is something i like doing
8977397 i dont think theres any update just yet because they got documents that were in chinese and they were seeking to verify them
8977398 we dont have a specific time limit or timeline set for it
8977399 i was asking myself am i really made to play tennis
8977400 am i going to make the top 100 its not worth playing tennis if you dont make the top 100
8977401 this kind of loss i had today is just incentive to work harder
8977402 to go back on the court and to keep working hard and practicing and improving
8977403 you put yourself on such a platform and everybody is trying to pull it from underneath you
8977404 every year is tougher and tougher because we set ourselves standards that we always try to better and the competition is getting tougher
8977405 wed like to win every trophy and be a part of every big game but i think it will happen less and less in the future
8977406 motivation wise tennis is up and down but right now im enjoying what i do
8977407 the key is enjoying if i dont enjoy it there is no meaning in being on the court
8977408 no matter how good or bad shes playing shes always tough and thats inspired me
8977409 ive been no 1 for a long time now but im waiting for a young one coming up
8977410 ive never seen a ground as boggy in my life
8977411 if bowlers run up over any period of time they would be two to three inches into the ground
8977412 there is no way that we could ask anybody to play cricket out there
8977413 if we dont get the drying weather as you can see it is grey and overcast then it might be the same again
8977414 weve made it very clear our policy is not to recruit league players

8977468 the biggest thing is we want to play better last year we felt like we laid an egg in the first quarter at north carolina

8977470 if we continue to win that will become a permanent thing around here

8977502 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8977503 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8977504 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive

8977673 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8977674 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8977675 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8977676 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8977728 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n

8977730 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8977731 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8977732 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8977733 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8977734 m s que una carta pastoral es un libro con toda la fundamentaci n de datos y lo importante es que es la intervenci n de una figura de iglesia con preocupaci n por la tica

8977740 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8977741 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8977742 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
8977743 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
8977744 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
8977745 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
8977746 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8977747 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8977748 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8977756 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
8977757 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8977758 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8977759 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8977790 apparently the department of community affairs was well aware of the problems this new fee and quota systems would cause for victims of disasters and they didnt speak up to prevent these fees from being opposed this is the kind of decision making that gives trenton bureaucrats a reputation for being totally insensitive to the needs and sensibilities of average taxpayers its only common sense traumatized victims of fires should not be considered fair game for a new revenue raising scheme

8977806 ha habido ese contratiempo pero la plantilla est compensada y tenemos otros jugadores que pueden hacerlo bien por lo dem s no tengo todav a decidido el once que saltar inicialmente al terreno de juego ya que voy a ver hasta el domingo qu hago con un par de puestos y c mo le podemos sacar mayor rendimiento
8977807 un apoyo incondicional pero tenemos que ser nosotros quienes les demos cosas para que sigan viniendo y apoyando al equipo normas de uso

8977810 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house

8977814 governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8977815 typically what youre trying to do is get the product from the wellhead to the wheel in the most cost effective manner
8977816 so if you produce it in the gulf of mexico and can get it to the wheel of a driver in texas thats much closer than producing it in the gulf and getting it to the wheel of someone in china
8977817 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
8977818 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
8977819 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
8977820 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8977821 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
8977822 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong

8977827 one of the main challenges facing the african continent is approaching key issues in a systematic and well organised coordinated and harmonised fashion
8977828 whether the challenge is poverty disease illiteracy war civil unrests or gender equality it is important to approach these challenges with a clear vision and well developed plans and strategies on how to confront the challenges
8977829 the tabling and adoption of the gender policy by the assembly will fulfill one of the commissions dreams
8977830 statistics continue to show that access to resources in not equitable between women and men across the continent violence against women and girls in conflicts and situations of insecurity is reaching an alarming stage
8977831 this is a historic decision for womens rights not just in mexico city not even just in mexico but for women all over latin america
8977832 the best legitimization of the law can be seen in society itself the women who requested its enforcement from the day after it was issued and who continue demanding care in public hospitals for the first time in our history the country is responding to the actual circumstances that motivate women to resort to abortion reasons that do not need the authorization of a prosecutor a judge or a physician regardless of the law women make choices conscientiously responsibly and freely
8977833 a freedom that is recognized and exercised can never again be undermined except in a context of authoritarian regression
8977834 more than 80 percent of the women who have received safe and legal abortions since the law was approved have identified themselves as catholic they still have exercised their right to choose motherhood not have motherhood forced upon them the courts decision respects this right and refuses to call these women criminals
8977835 this decision is of transcendental importance not only for human rights but as a stand for the secular state against religious fundamentalism it is a lesson for the future not only for mexico city but for the entire country and for the whole region

8977853 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
8977854 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
8977855 im aware of enhanced importance of this issue because of my age
8977856 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
8977857 governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8977858 preparation for bad weather has been at the top of mind and we prepare for it all year
8977859 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
8977860 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
8977861 the reasonable action to be undertaken was the cut off of diplomatic relations as a temporary measure after the end of the occupation of the territory we will see when and how that can be restored
8977862 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
8977863 orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation
8977864 russian armed forces including so called peacekeepers are declared as occupying armed forces
8977865 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
8977866 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8977867 challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
8977868 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
8977869 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8977870 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops

8977874 lindsey hunter hasnt done anything wrong he was misled by other people who were conducting transactions in the corporation were still trying to figure out who did what
8977875 our little room looked very bare at first with nothing on the walls
8977876 but thanks to daddy who had brought my picture postcards and film star collection i have transformed the walls into one gigantic picture this makes it look much more cheerful
8977877 no dude this article is not cool i agree with the authors position but hes not making the world any better by putting it out there in his antagonistic manner
8977878 in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works let the woman learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety
8977879 in alaska governor palin challenged a corrupt system and passed a landmark ethics reform bill she has actually used her veto and cut budgetary spending
8977880 she put a stop to the bridge to nowhere that would have cost taxpayers 400 million dollars
8977881 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8977882 feminist for life she is the mother of five her youngest child born in april has down syndrome
8977883 cnn sen john mccain has picked alaska gov sarah palin as his running mate a senior mccain campaign official told cnn on friday
8977884 but this proposed rule goes far beyond the abortion issue it could mean a woman who visits a federally funded clinic might not receive information about contraceptive options including emergency contraceptives that could prevent a rape victim from becoming pregnant that is medically indefensible some peoples religions or personal principles dictate that abortion and surgical sterilization are always wrong and some belief systems extend that abhorance to contraceptives but the reality is that contraception for most people is a health issue not a moral issue if an emergency room doctor does not explain all options available to a woman after she has been raped that doctor is derelict in his or her duty to the patient the same goes for doctors who wont help a woman who simply wants to prevent a pregnancy for any reason
8977885 a routine trip to the social security office monday turned into 30 minutes of shock disbelief and irritation for lapriss gilbert who was forced to leave the federal building by a guard who objected to her
8977886 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8977887 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8977888 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8977889 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8977890 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8977891 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8977892 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8977893 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8977894 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8977895 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8977896 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it
8977897 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8977898 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter
8977899 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8977900 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
8977901 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
8977902 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8977903 it turns out that downturns can be times of tremendous opportunity and yes profit for entrepreneurs but only if they play their cards right
8977904 ill kill you fool youre a disgrace to the human race its time to run like a real man take that speed walker do it again sucker thats going to be trouble with the capital mr t snickers get some nuts
8977905 i have been pitying fools for 28 years and its never personal why didnt someone talk to the actor who played speed walker he would tell you about my character

8977910 uh im a little short of cash perhaps you could help me out
8977911 i dont carry much cash with me i only have ten pounds but come home with me and ill get more from the safe
8977912 why ten pounds is more money than ive seen in my whole life thatll be plenty
8977913 any time you have material presented more than once it increases the likelihood that it will be encoded and consolidated for later use
8977914 it is not the case more is better it is how information is presented
8977915 simply repeating curriculum is not necessarily going to produce gains you want
8977916 its really hard to sit there as his parents and listen to people who havent met your child say oh no this wouldnt happen or that cant happen
8977917 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8977918 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8977919 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8977920 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8977921 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording

8977924 it will go toward equipment maintenance and costs to continue operating the system
8977925 our costs are going up and we need to make sure we are putting enough capital in to cover the capital improvement program and to pay down those debts
8977926 the village decided to implement smaller increases rather than just one giant increase and another in five years because it is difficult to predict costs five years out
8977927 there is no point being the treasurer of nsw if people arent prepared to make the difficult decisions around public sector reform
8977928 i will not be treasurer if the mini budget in november does not return the states credit rating to a sustainable path
8977929 im viewing this as if ive got a contract with the taxpayers of nsw
8977930 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8977931 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8977932 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8977933 tagging itself is challenging as it involves converting an images pixels to descriptive words
8977934 but what is novel with the tagging over time or t t technology is that the system adapts as peoples preferences for images and words change
8977935 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8977936 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8977937 what happens to the people who have lived in the surreal playboy mansion world where its parties and fun all the time and why do they leave that world do they get too old or are they simply ready to move on to a different phase in their lives
8977938 shelley has spent her whole adult life living in the mansion but when she gets booted out shes completely adrift
8977939 we took that idea and spent a few months ruminating over where she would land and we finally came up with the idea that she should enter the world of a sorority a misfit sorority that desperately needs her help
8977940 shelley has this idea that if she changes the zetas into super hot girls then they will be able to get guys and if they can get guys they can get pledges and keep their house
8977941 she teaches the girls how to be cool and cute and popular thats definitely true but for shelley its all about self confidence
8977942 shelley defined herself as a bunny and thought that was all she was capable of she only defined herself in terms of her value as an object for male eyes but then she learns she has more inherent talents and a bigger purpose in life than just being a bunny
8977943 its not just a message for girls but everyone learning to accept themselves and love themselves for who they are
8977944 when we first meet shelley she may think shes the hottest girl but she learns to realize that how you look is not important its about how you look at yourself
8977945 every girl goes through a time in her life in which she tries on new looks and new attitudes and
8977946 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8977947 thats what we do thats what people in communities do
8977948 i didnt have a sense that there would be a change
8977949 we were really handcuffed because we were tied up in juneau
8977950 it was probably one race i didnt take for granted i was probably more nervous because of being gone
8977951 i will never look at politics the same way again
8977952 ill continue to do what i think got me to the point im at which is to answer phone calls and e mails
8977953 isto certamente melhorou a capacidade dos humanos de criar e se adaptar de se relacionar em grupos e com grupos comunidades e culturas e de responder dor associada s intera es sociais
8977954 entretanto o c rtex cerebral tamb m pode ter tido um efeito n o intencional de permitir aos humanos reviver re experimentar e sofrer a dor social
8977955 h algo de intang vel em rela o ao dano emocional com a dor f sica voc pode ver a ferida mas no abuso emocional normalmente h temor e ansiedade remanescentes
8977956 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8977957 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8977958 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8977959 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8977960 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8977961 tropical storm gustav was back in focus despite reassurances from the iea international energy agency and the us department for energy that they were ready to tap into emergency oil reserves in case the storm causes significant supply disruption in the gulf of mexico
8977962 the focus is likely to remain on tropical storm gustav and potential supply disruptions during the weekend and earlier next week
8977963 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
8977964 das habe ich bef rchtet aber genau so komme ich mir hier ma
8977965 sebastian ein solches quiz w re sicherlich ein erlebnis mr
8977966 ach ich glaube ich muss auch mal einen quiz veranstalten mr
8977967 und wenn david in den spam ordner schauen w rde dann h tte
8977968 the key point is not that we escaped a technical recession its to look at the fact that in the first of 2008 the canadian economy contracted
8977969 more importantly it deteriorated at a faster pace than the bank of canada had expected
8977970 every single category of business declined and detracted from growth residential structures non residential structures business machinery and equipment and this is the among the weakest pace of consumer spending weve had in years
8977971 the folks who were first to buy those are the early adopters those are the tech savvy ones and what it says is that big data buckets actually let you do a lot of stuff
8977972 i think theres a lot of education on all parts about what you get for what data allotment or data bucket as the industry terms it
8977973 they havent yet tapped into the multimedia rich capabilities of the device and for the most part theyre likely still using it for light web browsing light email and for the most part voice use
8977974 they havent really gotten into the guts of what this thing can do
8977975 you will always have the vast majority of end users who dont seem to use it a lot because they really are using the device for mundane everyday purposes lets face it for all of the capabilities of todays smartphones the vast majority of us are still using it for voice calls
8977976 voice remains the killer application for every phone including the super sophisticated iphone
8977977 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
8977978 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8977979 challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
8977980 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
8977981 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8977982 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8977983 turn on dep for all programs and services except those i select
8977984 when he speaks hes really able to say how shall i put it inspirational things america needs this kind of voice
8977985 hes friendly and he cares about citizens he cares about people
8977986 im afraid he will not be as hard with iran as we wish he would be
8977987 the other issue i hope he will be hard with israel and force it to withdraw from the west bank and to form a palestinian state but i am sure he will not do so but im sure john mccain will not do so either
8977988 mr obama is like mr bush like all of them
8977989 no one does anything for the palestinians only for the jewish for the palestinians no one in america will do anything
8977990 one thing is that obama is connected to africa then he is close to africa and he knows a lot about africa
8977991 i think hes a great role model for afro americans and for the africans at large
8977992 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in botswana can expect to live 43 years in japan 86 years that is unnecessary there is no good biological reason why that is the case
8977993 it arises because of the social conditions in which people are born they grow they live they work and they age and because of the set of economic arrangements the values of society that are responsible for those conditions
8977994 that is quite wrong it is quite wrong we know that education is a key driver of the health of those girls when they become women and it is a key determinant of the health of their children when they become mothers
8977995 that infant and child deaths could be reduced to a high degree by investing in the education of women
8977996 oh it will be such a pleasure to work with you
8977997 was the center of the greater new orleans safety net system for the past 269 years and the dominant source of care for the indigent population serving 63 percent of the uninsured
8977998 katrina revealed some ugly truths about our nations failure to care for its citizens in the wake of a natural disaster
8977999 and we are still not prepared today we need a national healthcare system that has the capability of stepping in at the time of impact and providing the healthcare services needed
8978000 understanding and mitigating vulnerable bycatch in southern african trawl and longline fisheries
8978001 the findings help accurately identify management measures to reduce the wasteful killing of these magnificent birds while not unnecessarily disrupting fishing activities or impacting other vulnerable marine life like turtles and sharks
8978002 while this information is valuable its crucial that it translates into compliance with mitigation measures on the part of fishing operations
8978003 this has management implications for seabirds because of the dramatic changes in marine ecosystems as a result of past fishing activities
8978004 the possibility exists that management actions could place a further burden on these species
8978005 albatrosses and petrels undertake amazing journeys where many species frequently circumnavigate the globe crossing many national and international jurisdictions as well as coming across numerous fishing fleets from various nations
8978006 the health of our oceans can in many ways be judged by the health of our seabirds only together can we have any hope of saving these birds from extinction and protect our oceans
8978007 no place in the united states and perhaps in the world is as blessed as san francisco by an amazing cornucopia of products grown nearby
8978008 but the answer to the question is a qualified yes because there are challenges to increase both the production marketing and consumption of local food
8978009 its impossible to determine precisely how much locally grown food is consumed in the city of san francisco or in fact how much of what is consumed is produced on local farms and ranches
8978010 the commercial food system in the region as throughout the united states does not track the origin of what it sells primarily because consumers do not yet demand to know the origin of the foods they eat
8978011 new development in this region is consuming an acre of farmland for every 9 7 residents the epitome of urban sprawl if we continue at this rate well lose another 800 000 acres by 2050 and much of that will be an unnecessary waste because of how inefficiently we are paving over the best land on earth
8978012 despite the challenges there are great opportunities to increase eating locally in san francisco and the bay area
8978013 the local foods movement has momentum in this region public and private institutions are starting to source food locally and as the fossil fuel era wanes local food may gain in advantage in the marketplace over food that is processed and shipped long distances
8978014 no pun intended we hope this report offers food for thought for san franciscos consumers area producers and other cities across the country
8978015 as gulf coast residents mark the third anniversary of hurricane katrina they are once again under the threat of a potentially very serious hurricane
8978016 i urge residents to prepare now for the possibility of evacuation orders by preparing a pet disaster kit and making plans to evacuate with your animals if its not safe for you its not safe for your pet
8978017 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8978018 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8978019 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8978020 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8978021 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8978022 this study provides further evidence for darwins theory of natural selection by showing that environmental conditions can directly impact genes controlling physical traits that affect the survival of species
8978023 this could have a devastating effect on the marine environment and negatively impact chuuks tourist industry
8978024 some areas of mangroves that provide breeding grounds for many fish species could be completely decimated
8978025 there is reason to believe that hoyo maru is leaking from her bunker which means there could be a lot more oil left to spill were hoping that japanese historians can help us to determine if she went down with a full tank so we can estimate the full scale of the threat
8978026 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense it is not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8978027 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8978028 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8978029 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8978030 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8978031 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8978032 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8978033 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8978034 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8978035 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8978036 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8978037 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8978038 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8978039 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8978040 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8978041 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8978042 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further
8978043 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8978044 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8978045 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
8978046 for the people of the gulf coast region katrina is just as devastating today as it was in 2005
8978047 katrina was a cataclysmic disaster that forced hundreds of thousands of people to migrate across the country or stay and suffer with little or no help many of those who left havent returned and those who stayed continue to face unemployment and mortgages on uninhabitable or non existent homes this project documents through survivors stories that the situation is still as real and as challenging as it was that very first day
8978048 katrina is a story that still has many chapters left when you open chris ushers book you realize just how important it is that we all continue to support rebuilding in the gulf coast this book serves as a reminder and mechanism by which people can provide some much needed support
8978049 weve had a long and productive relationship with chris and are proud to support this project his work has touched countless people over the years because of his profound ability to capture images that tell powerful moving stories were honored that we can use kodak expertise in film and on demand printing to support chris and his ground breaking project

8978053 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
8978054 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
8978055 the reasonable action to be undertaken was the cut off of diplomatic relations as a temporary measure after the end of the occupation of the territory we will see when and how that can be restored
8978056 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
8978057 orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation
8978058 russian armed forces including so called peacekeepers are declared as occupying armed forces
8978059 preparation for bad weather has been at the top of mind and we prepare for it all year
8978060 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
8978061 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8978062 challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
8978063 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
8978064 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8978065 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops

8978071 often buy loans with a less than 20 percent down payment and then offset the risk with an insurance policy
8978072 and then came the third act twist it twists a fairly cool if somewhat lifeless science fiction film into a laughable piece of garbage that begins to beat the audience about the head with some of the dumbest god damned things youve heard in a long time im not talking improbable im not talking impossible im talking downright fucking goofy
8978073 it is immediately followed up by a revelation so profoundly ludicrous so mind numbingly incomprehensible that it leaves you quite stunned once you realize what this film is really all about youre gonna be kinda pissed and thats when they drop one of the most unbelievable lines i think ive ever run across in the history of bad science fiction a line that will haunt this film whenever it is mentioned a line that will haunt me whenever i think about it
8978074 this thing is just silly a grotesque cinematic partial birth abortion unlike anything ive experienced

8978078 the online commercial driver alcohol and drug testing result database
8978079 in comparison with other online development work weve done establishing this database was a pretty quick project
8978080 the goal was to create an easy way to check alcohol and drug test histories of commercial driver applicants in real time an online searchable database allows for that
8978081 carriers can submit the tests results online via the internet or by paper record which are then manually entered into the database
8978082 its all designed to weed out the bad apples so a driver cant fail a test at one company wait a while then go down the street and get hired by another one because now as their system is clean they pass the tests
8978083 for example if a driver from missouri or oklahoma tries to hire on with an arkansas carrier and fails a drug test we cant load that information into the database because they are from out of state
8978084 we cant search or report on out of state drivers thats where a national database would come in
8978085 drivers are the most important people at our company and this service helps to ensure they are safe vehicle operators
8978086 this online service is incredibly valuable to our company and wed like to see it offered by every state
8978087 we must do our best to keep drug abusers out of our trucks and off our highways and this arkansas law is helping to make sure they dont get a job as a truck driver
8978088 we would also support a federal law that would create a national database like arkansas has
8978089 making one road safer is important but making rural roads around the country less deadly is absolutely essential
8978090 thanks to these funds our rural roads are on their way to becoming as safe as they are beautiful
8978091 the port of los angeles further intrusion into the competitive structure of the drayage market makes the ata lawsuit even more important and illustrates precisely the type of disruption of trucking services in the economy that congress found so inefficient and disruptive
8978092 creating an artificial non competitive market with highly inflated costs and prices hinders our national competitive ability and sets a dangerous precedent
8978093 you take a major source of instability out of the market you don t have to worry about it anymore

8978107 that this travesty was committed by the democratic party has forever changed my approach to politics

8978109 i know that is the way it is being spun but its not prototypical anyone who doesnt take time to analyze it will do so at their own peril
8978110 that the winter of discontent in politics had come for women

8978173 another view that is being addressed to the ummah is the concept of fighting the rulers and that through military struggle islam will return to the world stage again this is based upon a particular hadith it has been narrated from many sources including imam muslim that the prophet saw said do not challenge the people of authority unless you see explicit kufr of which you have clear proof from allah from islam ibn kathir in his tafseer states that if the khaleefah reverts to the rule of disbelief he would be fought until he returned to the implementation of islam and the shariah ibn hajr in his fateh al bari also states that if he becomes a kafir or changes the shari ah he should be fought and removed this view is also mentioned in nayl al awtar and supported by imam shawkani that is if the ruler rules by other than the shariah he is fought until he either repents or is removed however that is the only situation that it applies to i e the ruling of a khaleefah who resorts to the kufr ruling and disobedience to allah it does not relate to the khaleefah becoming tyrannical and also does not relate to his personality becoming corrupt in which case obedience to him is binding and the muslims should still pray behind him and fight jihad behind him however these ahadith are not connected to the current situation they are all connected to revolt and rising against the khaleefah and are titled under the subject of khurooj min al khaleefah i e rising against the authority of a khaleefah or an imam the current situation is not that of the khulafaa who used to rule by islam and then turned away from islam the current problem is also not merely related to removing a ruler by killing him rather entire systems of kufr have been implemented over muslims for over 76 years none of the rulers have ever ruled by the shari ah and none of them are khulafaa within a khilafah the systems that they are applying are either monarchies or capitalistic with some sort of democratic framework hence the reality isn t that of removing a bad khaleefah within an islamic state the reality is of uprooting an entire kufr system including it s ruler to again establish dar ul islam the current rulers are not comparable in any way to khulafaa who have introduced one kufr law into the khilafah hence these ahadith which have always been understood in the context of dar ul islam i e where islam is implemented and the muslims possess the security do not apply upon the current situation the reality which they address is that of removing a khaleefah who rules with kufr within the islamic state not that of uprooting an entire kufr system merely by fighting and the only situation that is comparable from the evidences is the establishment of the islamic state for the very first time by the prophet saw and the struggle which he saw went through in order to establish this state and change dar ul kufr to dar ul islam this is the struggle which he saw referred to in the hadith of hamza and as is illustrated in the books of sunnah and seerah as that is the only instance in which a complete system of kufr existed and was changed to a complete system of islam so the matter is regarding the changing of a system not merely a ruler the ahadith of fighting apply to changing a ruler i e a khaleefah who has gone astray not a system only the struggle of the prophet saw in makkah applies to the changing of a system so military struggle is not the method of re establishing the khilafah

8978192 yeah we know the police and military battles against drug gangs dont work but we sold the plan up and down the potomac
8978193 the hugely expensive antidrug campaigns we are waging around the world are basically futile
8978194 even as i write these words it is virtually certain that somewhere on the streets of washington d c an eighteen year old white kid from the maryland or north virginia suburbs is buying a stash of drugs from an eighteen year old black kid the white kid is going to take that stash back to the suburbs and make some quick money by selling it to other kids

8978202 it was a very difficult time for our family and friends
8978203 they have all sacrificed so much over the last four years it was a difficult goodbye because we knew that whatever happened after the olympics our lives would never be the same again
8978204 it was a time full of emotion full of apprehension in some ways fear in a lot of ways excitement about this journey this epic journey that we were about to go on it didnt disappoint
8978205 the investment over the last four years was going to be shown in six minutes
8978206 we were really well prepared really positive we hit the start line went off and the tension went the first few strokes were excellent we really hit the race hard into the first 1000m completely to race plan with 500m to go they were still with us
8978207 i think we were about one and a half seconds down on the australians but there was no sense of panic we had this crescendo feeling in the last 500 when we just stepped on and on and suddenly the australians were manageable
8978208 it was very clinical how we did the last 300 400 metres to be honest im not quite sure where it came from but we had a lot more power than i thought we had even though we had been gunning it for the whole race

8978211 they want their first three points in the league so we have some problems we know this we need to respect them even more
8978212 when i arrived here some people said to me you need to win three derbies tottenham fulham and west ham
8978213 they said we didnt need to win against the other teams but for me i need to win all the other games against wigan manchester city everyone
8978214 i know juande and the players at tottenham they made one or two mistakes in the games before ours but we need to remember this is a big chance for tottenham because it is a derby
8978215 in the last game one or two players played because they wanted to help chelsea
8978216 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
8978217 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here

8978221 the present international financial system is hopelessly bankrupt and could not be saved it could only be reorganized in a bankrutpcy designed to defend people not financial speculators

8978228 dont believe everything you read theres a lot of rumor and speculation out there about kindle
8978229 one thing i can tell you for sure is that there will be no new version of kindle this year a new version will come out sometime next year at the earliest
8978230 if the kindle can make things happen that would be a welcome change
8978231 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8978232 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8978233 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8978234 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8978235 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8978236 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
8978237 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
8978238 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
8978239 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
8978240 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
8978241 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
8978242 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance

8978270 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world set free because neosignal means no more compromise nobody to answer to a product a brand which is theirs from start to finish autonomy time to push boundaries
8978271 funked out rolling badness from phace this track is gonna be in my box for a long while to come its the perfect combination of a deep nasty dancefloor killer timeless
8978272 in his debut release for neosignal phace delivers another top of the range 12
8978273 probably my favourite track by phace evar a very untypical phace track one might say cause its so riff driven and progresses in a more subtle and dosed way than most genre counterparts it does things ive never heard a phace tune do before and yet still its undeniably phace but the most important reason why its such a standout tune is because its got so much heart so much more than most current techy d amp b its like hearing music youve been wanting to hear for a long time leaving you wondering why arent there more tracks like this and the answer is simple because magic like this doesnt happen often
8978274 neosignals first release brings the long awaited cold champagne rollers dont come much slicker than this phace bring the phunk with style once again killer every time and sick to mix massive support from the lifted camp
8978275 cold champagne brings back the phace funk from yesteryears a resurrected cut from their earlier days gets a face lift and delivers a tight blend of old phace with the new deep driving and introspective a must for any djs box whos willing to dig deeper
8978276 this is phace doing what they do best stomping driving twisting turning appealing to that part of your brain that only phace seem to know how to get to serious for me the best part about this tune is the fantastic switch from the brilliantly unusual levitating pad solo into a relentless persuasive groove that manages to breathe as much as it kicks and so the bar is set higher once again
8978277 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world set free because neosignal means no more compromise nobody to answer to a product a brand which is theirs from start to finish autonomy time to push boundaries

8978310 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8978311 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8978312 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8978313 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8978314 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8978315 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8978316 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8978317 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8978318 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8978319 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8978320 how long can obamas campaign run on hate of bush most voters dont harbor and nurture that hate
8978321 bushs decisions in office have protected us from a second major attack

8978328 i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8978329 the very same arguments that you pumas have against obama apply to palin as well think of these things before you are quick to jump all over obamas resume
8978330 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8978331 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8978332 you have no idea how good it feels to be so popular
8978333 i lost my virginity at 14 and ive loved women ever since the way a woman smells its the ultimate aphrodisiac
8978334 either these meetings will help me deal with my addiction or ill meet lots of women either way i cant lose

8978338 we have the army disaster management teams police and other groups of rescuers making every effort to save the population

8978340 and when a story gets to you that gives you the energy to meet the challenges of turning it into a film it wasnt easy the fact that we started in 2001 and completed the film in 2007 gives you an idea of the problems we faced
8978341 his advice to me while i was making the film was to be careful because it was a difficult film he liked it a lot he said but it was very difficult
8978342 because oukili himself came not from the sewers but from a similar background it was a dream he realised through love and respect respect was one of the things he taught them but also perhaps learned from them because remember he himself was only 20 when he arrived only a little older than the children they grew up together
8978343 one which belongs to the distant past the fact that people are talking about such things again is a dangerous sign for europe
8978344 the oil companies have been hugely influential in alaska certainly over the last decade and a half with the prior two administrations for alaskans as owners of the resource it is time to embrace our sovereignty
8978345 i am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the department of public safety regarding trooper wooten
8978346 at no time did i authorize any member of my staff to do so
8978347 a fundamentally new direction to get america back on track both here and around the world
8978348 this roman like facade or facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there its almost like he wants to come out and be emperor like in the setting at least the facade

8978379 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8978380 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
8978381 we went out and demi was dancing up on me and humping me from behind she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
8978382 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get breast milk out of my black dress
8978383 veoh responded to compliant dmca takedown notices on a same day basis it notified users of its policies against it registered a copyright agent with the copyright office it terminated users who were repeat infringers and blocked new registrations from the same e mail addresses it used hashes to stop the same infringing videos from being uploaded by other users
8978384 if infringement is rampant right and left and anyone ought to be able to see it but you dont do anything about it then maybe you dont have
8978385 these clips on youtube are from saturday night live things that one can simply look at and say that must belong to somebody
8978386 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners
8978387 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the
8978388 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
8978389 im aware of enhanced importance of this issue because of my age
8978390 understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8978391 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8978392 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
8978393 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8978394 challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of
8978395 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make
8978396 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8978397 find out what youre most passionate about and figure out a way to get paid to do it
8978398 really i dont think its going to earn him any points
8978399 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
8978400 its going to be a very sad day when the wrecking balls come to tear down this treasure
8978401 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
8978402 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8978403 well see how he is but i think it would be asking a lot to be involved in a game of such importance
8978404 youre always aware when you try to take a player from america that theres issues with work permits and visas but were delighted now that weve got him over
8978405 its maybe a bit soon considering we have a game on sunday but hopefully once he settles in he can show he can make an impact for us
8978406 hes a good player in an area of the field we were hoping to improve and hopefully once we have everyone integrated well see some benefits from it
8978407 there was a problem with the flight company and there were a couple of flight changes but it was nothing too serious
8978408 im excited to be here its what ive been waiting for over the last few weeks now that everything is finalised im happy
8978409 ive seen a couple of games and i spoke to maurice johnston a little bit about it and he explained how great a game it is how competitive it is and how big the rivalry is
8978410 his advice was just to be prepared go out there and play my game and to enjoy the atmosphere and the experience
8978411 its been pretty amazing needless to say that im a huge huge fan of everything hes done and of the stars that hes helped to create along the way
8978412 kerry is a little old school in the way that hes so adamant about songs making total and complete sense as well as having a purpose for the lyric a lot of songs these days when you listen to them youre like theyre not even saying anything nothing like that will fly with kerry hes really into the songs telling a story having them make you feel something you know
8978413 in the beginning its really about getting your foot in the door so i had to record a few things in the very beginning that i wasnt so crazy about but i made the decision early on to never do anything that made me feel like i was compromising myself or my musical integrity before i met kerry people were all over the place with their ideas about what they saw for me they immediately thought pop like christinia aguilera i respect her but its just not me i always just craved that real musciality the kind of stuff i wanted to listen to my friendship with kerry has lasted this long because weve be very honest with each other from the beginning i told him what exactly i was looking to do and thankfully he saw that for me some of the songs are more of a standard jazz style some are more neo soul and r amp b so it was really about finding the perfect mix it takes finding the right person who will stand by you and listen to what you have to say
8978414 i love teena marie and im a fan of hers but i dont isten to her to draw inspiration from because i wanted to remain true to myself and i really needed to create my own sound my parents had a lot of jazz around the house but i loved chaka khan and the pointer sisters so growing up it was never anything that anyone put on me to do
8978415 theres the title track i start off in my low range im not reaching for those big notes i can just kinda cool out and let everybody know what im about i also love same game that one has grown on me more and more as i sing it live and its just a straight up shout out to the men out there laughs i can kinda go out there and be a voice for the women for this day and age with that song its coming from a young womans point of view
8978416 actually i like duffy all the even numbered tracks on her cd and i really love to support other girls that are doing the same thing because if youre in this industry you know how hard it is to catch a break and its not an easy game had i made a record that was 40 of what i am and 60 of what the trends are i might be a little more scared that someone could come and take my spot but i have confidence in what were doing because its all me and no one can come do what i do
8978417 i signed with kerrys production company before singing to the label so hes got this whole workshop going on with some of the most incredible writers
8978418 thats everywhere out here in l a im seeing that stuff like you wouldnt believe ive never been that kind of person ever i feel that you can f your way to the top if you dont plan on sticking around but youll be forgotten people like that come and go but you really need to plant your feet sturdy and allow them to get to know the real you thats just ignorance on the other personss part theyre probably pissed because they cant get any laughs so they take it out on some artist really looking for an opportunity and try to shut them down
8978419 what im most proud of is that it takes music to where it used to be having real songs live instruments and real arrangements it was thought out premeditated to make the kind of quality of music of what we really wanted to present sometimes i get discouraged when i listen to the radio im thinking in my weakest moments wow are people even going to be receptive to that again it was important to me as a vocalist and musician that other musicians would enjoy it i really wanted to create something timeless and i think thats what we did i really hope and pray that we can just bring music back
8978420 barbies campaign shows girls that they can aspire to the highest levels of leadership including the presidency
8978421 at little after nine this morning weve already done as much trading as we did yesterday were well on our way to do a lot of trade
8978422 hostilities between russia and georgia increase the risk around the south caucasus as a westward transit route for caspian oil and gas both now and over the longer term
8978423 bakus new interest in russia may stem from a desire to protect the relationship with moscow or a sense that nabucco is less likely than ever to materialise
8978424 cheneys trip will be inflammatory his rhetorical track record and known views on russia make very strident statements likely
8978425 the georgian conflict will complicate efforts to move the nabucco gas pipeline project forward particularly if the instability prompts central asian suppliers to turn to other potential export routes
8978426 europe and china are facing increasingly more demand for imported energy and they havent managed to get it from central asia and that window is now firmly closed russia has been much more successful in getting those deals tied up
8978427 political problems aside we could import gas from the middle of the next decade
8978428 there are several possibilities to fill nabucco without pumping gas through georgia
8978429 california has been hit by the financial and housing crisis more than most states thats for sure and the unemployment rate has risen over the last year and a half
8978430 you would expect that at the end of a six year expansion incomes would have moved higher instead were going into the next downturn from a lower point than where we started at the beginning of the decade
8978431 there is tremendous wealth in california and there are pockets of california that have continued to do extraordinarily well
8978432 thats part of the story of income inequality that continues to widen in california
8978433 the fact that its so expensive to live in san francisco doesnt mean we dont have low income people as part of our community
8978434 people who work as housecleaners and busboys in the city tend to live in other places san franciscos low poverty rate doesnt mean the city is doing all the right things it could mean that san francisco is too expensive for poor people
8978435 then it takes a couple of years of growth to see poverty going down
8978436 if we worked to eradicate child poverty it would improve the lives of every one of us
8978437 we need to create more jobs and have policies that encourage firms to hire people here as opposed to moving jobs elsewhere
8978438 we need to get opportunities to people in areas that are still struggling education is part of it but so are jobs
8978439 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
8978440 i believe in local control i come from a city council
8978441 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
8978442 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
8978443 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
8978444 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
8978445 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
8978446 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
8978447 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
8978448 in order to have affordable housing you shouldnt have to live in tracy if you work in san jose
8978449 you should have a range of housing and transportation options
8978450 the next u s president is going to be ishmael whether we like it or not and whether he knows it or not
8978451 worth a look it is however recommended by matthew dancona
8978452 on the internet i keep in touch with opendemocracy a website on global current affairs and its useful offshoot ourkingdom
8978453 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
8978454 he said make sure you listen to the news from hunting camp i should have put two and two together
8978455 i have to admit that you do sloth like nobodys business
8978456 i just sic them on punks like that like a couple of pitbulls
8978457 the value proposition is that it provides both business and consumers with cost savings with international calls as well as todays expensive roaming costs our software illustrates how much can be done using voice and messaging capabilities
8978458 churn has been endemically high in this industry but its how the carriers work as they almost push them to leaving than trying to keep them
8978459 theyve all had a hard time trying to understand their customers or doing a good job of communication with them
8978460 we seek to provide the kind of service whether thats network coverage products and services or customer service that not only satisfies customers but also makes them likely to recommend us to a family member friend or colleague
8978461 you never take pictures of something you want to forget

8978464 you have to go to juilliard youve got to move to new york and study with this teacher
8978465 oh i heard this opera sung by this person and oh its terrible because it should be this way
8978466 oh god those gross slides listen to the tasteless stuff
8978467 i know this piece very well ive heard it so many times and you played it exactly the way i always imagined it the way i want it to be played
8978468 fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past has reached across the aisle with a fighting spirit and deep compassion
8978469 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs
8978470 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
8978471 the people of america expect us to seek public office and serve for the right reasons
8978472 there is only one candidate who has fought for america and that man is john mccain
8978473 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

8978477 our judiciary is not there to second guess the legislature
8978478 weve all figured out now our court system needs to change for us to move forward
8978479 ive been defending businesses for 41 years and i had not realized how many i represented
8978480 in case this is your first time here we make bands here
8978481 they make albums and those albums go to no 1 donnie his album hasnt come out yet but it comes out sept 2 hopefully you guys will make it what no 1 my favorite number
8978482 the only way to describe it is surreal sometimes i feel like im standing beside myself watching these things happen
8978483 just watching the video there was crazy the hairs on my arms were standing up
8978484 who are you where did you come from what hit records have you ever made
8978485 the guy is a star donnie klang is a star
8978486 didnt see a lot in the video that really separated him from that field
8978487 this was crazy for a first time artist especially one from a reality show where you kind of just sign the contract just to audition
8978488 the thing about me was that i was a surprise lots of people were preparing stuff for the group but they werent preparing anything for a solo artist that really worked in my favor it opened the gates for me to write a lot
8978489 we wanted it to be so that you dont know what to expect from track to track
8978490 and we wanted to stay clear from other lanes but still stay commercial
8978491 i had just finished the single after 20 something hours straight in the studio i was exhausted and i was in the car about halfway home to long island and diddy calls and was like come back to the city i want to test it out in clubs
8978492 when we did that video in march in hollywood it was just crazy
8978493 i remember being in elementary school watching all the bad boy videos now not only am i in one not only am i signed to bad boy but diddy is in my video thats crazy
8978494 donnie doesnt need any advice weve actually been writing a lot together lately i hope i can get on his next joint with him
8978495 i grew up on the early 90s r amp b groups and i was into the whole bad boy thing and i really liked boy bands thats what really pushed me over the edge to do music
8978496 my sisters my female friends had these dvds of nsync and backstreet boys going out on tour and i would see these swarms this sea of people just going crazy in the audience banging on the tour bus and i was like all right this is what i need to be doing in my life this is what ive wanted since i could remember and now its here
8978497 while we believe the earnings guidance is likely to put some short term pressure on the stock we do not believe it should overshadow the companys longer term growth prospects which in our opinion are still quite solid
8978498 sales could be even closer to 13 million if it werent for the gm anniversary sale which could provide a lift
8978499 but sales will still be substantially below a year ago
8978500 i o dal minuscolo spazio di questo blog lancio una proposta che rivolta a tutti i blogger che ritengano vergognosa questa storia un post che riproduca lopera di martin kippenberger anche senza commento personalmente non la ritengo un capolavoro anzi mi pare anche bruttina ma essa assume il valore di un simbolo quella della libert di espressione in questo caso artistica aggredita dalla millenaria arroganza di chi pretende di poter decidere per tutti oltre che per il suo gregge di bestie ottuse e belanti cosa debba o non debba poter essere visto letto sentito se solo per un giorno o due la rana crocifissa girasse in internet sarebbe un segno piccolo senza dubbio ma un segno
8978501 se soubesse dos riscos que amos correr n o teria feito o filme

8978523 the prime minister has been holding high level crisis talks with members of the military and said he hadnt ruled out initiating a state of emergency
8978524 but he is waiting until after saturday when the crown prince is due to make a speech
8978525 the crown prince may call for unity and the royal family are highly regardarded here
8978526 people saying about 1 000 protesters sealed off roads going into and out of the airports
8978527 thai airways labour and electricity unions have also said they will join strikes calling form the prime minister to resign
8978528 the prime minister has said to the protesters you are called the peoples alliance for democracy so what is it you want because the key element of democracy is elections
8978529 softened stance to give them time to leave the government house
8978530 but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out
8978531 today is the judgment day it is the peoples revolution and we must win
8978532 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8978533 sarah palin is an exciting choice by senator mccain she completes a strong ticket that will bring a real record of change and reform to washington
8978534 she is a strong defender of traditional family values with an unquestioned commitment to protect life governor palin knows we must aggressively pursue american energy sources like offshore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
8978535 in choosing governor palin mccain has put washington on notice he is serious about shaking up the status quo and leading a movement for reform on behalf of families and small businesses
8978536 the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass
8978537 it is a real roll of the dice and shows what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election
8978538 while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8978539 given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic
8978540 whats going to happen here is that desire to change that hillary clinton has helped bring about will ultimately lead to an obama biden win in november i dont think it changes the dynamics
8978541 i believe that people will look back and assess how hillary was treated by the media during the campaign primaries and it remains to be seen whether or not the ugly head of sexism in the media will raise its head again
8978542 i have always said that i wish i would have never been the only woman until now
8978543 and the world shrugged followed by the chirping of crickets
8978544 at least on our side the experienced one is at the top of the ticket
8978545 in april palin became a mother for the fifth time and returned to work three days later
8978546 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8978547 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8978548 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8978549 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8978550 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8978551 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8978552 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8978553 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8978554 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8978555 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8978556 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it
8978557 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8978558 we the undersigned fairfax columnists believe the sacking of mike carlton is an unjustified and provocative act by fairfax management
8978559 it has long been accepted practice that when staff journalists are on strike columnists should also remove their labour
8978560 mike carlton did no more than would have been done by any of the undersigned had our deadline coincided with industrial action we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
8978561 mike carlton is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff
8978562 over here you hear them talking about share price and restructuring but rarely about journalism
8978563 we are absolutely not disappointed at that price i think the record of people paying big prices for internet assets isnt really a great record
8978564 i am amazed that fairfax didnt do whatever it took to own control the largest employment recruitment website
8978565 i believe the only way for a company such as theirs which is heavily reliant and dependent on classifieds to insulate against the migration online is to ensure they are the dominant player online
8978566 i found no media model for a broadsheet classified dependent newspaper organisation that would pull me out of the hole i found myself in at fairfax
8978567 in hindsight i should have seen that classifieds tend to gravitate to the leading site in any category i should have done something other than try to compete head to head
8978568 we make no bones about the fact we do continue to see a leaking out of the bottom of the bucket when it comes to lineage classified advertising and that will no doubt continue
8978569 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not part of the business that is being affected at all
8978570 its really mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
8978571 i was holding him laying in bed with him when he died
8978572 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
8978573 so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8978574 my son michael called and he was wonderful hes coming home to be with me for a fews days i spoke to ali and cody too im hoping they will come to the wake i asked her if shes going to be at the wake but it sounds like dina is discouraging her from going shes deterring her from going to the wake to the funeral i said its only right that you go but dina hasnt called absolutely not shes too busy out having fun in the hamptons
8978575 in gro er verantwortung und offenheit die m glichen optionen

8978577 die berw ltigende mehrheit der bev lkerung und eine klare mehrheit der spd anh nger sind emp rt ber ypsilantis schmusekurs mit der linkspartei dass dies teile der spd weiterhin ignorieren ist ein skandal
8978578 just watching it makes me kind of want to cry because i know change is coming at least i hope that it is
8978579 it really says a lot that people are open minded enough to even accept a black candidate and have someone in that position
8978580 he can make big plays whether thats blocking downfield or making superman catches
8978581 if the balls up there hes going to go get it
8978582 the best thing weve done is spread the ball around
8978583 youll see the backs catch the ball tight ends catch the ball and then youve got guys like julio and mike mccoy at receiver that you have to account for
8978584 i think were about as ready as were going to be weve got a lot of stuff we put in aimed toward clemson lets go see what it looks like
8978585 hes an emotional guy but we dont need him making emotional decisions and trying to squeeze one in there thats when you create bad plays for yourself i think john parker understands a lot better the difference in going out there and making a play within the framework of what were trying to do and going out there and creating a bad play
8978586 preseason hype is just something to do in the summer what matters to me is this team and i think we have a good team i think were going to be able to put a really good product on the field and all this stuff in the preseason doesnt really matter until the season

8978638 mr yarone zober ravenstahls chief of staff in a most despicable act virtually threatened to destroy people for sending letters to the mayor in support of pat ford
8978639 it is clear to me that as long as i continue to fight to have my name restored by this administration i will only be further tarnished by this culture of deception and corruption i have stood by recently and watched as you personally retaliated against those who tried to support me and i cannot allow others to be penalized for not understanding that when it comes to pat ford honesty is not appreciated

8978668 for me and my lawyers its a question of free speech and the right to inform with transparency the public on a subject of public interest
8978669 we cannot say international justice is not a subject of public interest its a subject even of humanity interest
8978670 public opinion is one of the leading forces in support of international justice because it is for the protection of any citizen in the world thats the ideal goal of international justice and of the rules that have been established
8978671 its right that there is a right of public scrutiny in those institutions
8978672 the registry sent me a copy yesterday night august 27 three hours after the press was informed and my lawyer who was representing me at the point i was a suspect had not been informed yet
8978673 the tribunal does generally endeavour to inform the accused of the charges against them
8978674 i will respond to the charges and i dont see any illegal motivation behind this move to publish the material the tribunal has taken some action against free speech and transparency
8978675 as a journalist hartmann had access to public information and to various sources in various countries through many interviews
8978676 there were quite a lot of media reports that the book would be translated into bosnian serbian and croatian

8978689 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8978690 is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8978691 over the last two decades in the united sates even while flu vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality
8978692 further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion

8978708 access to site has been suspended in accordance with decision no 2008 55 of t r ankara 12th criminal court of peace
8978709 because the content which caused youtube to be blocked by ankaras 11th high criminal court without any justification was taken off from youtube the court decided to permit access to the web site youtube is now online
8978710 several media organs reported that youtube was accessible from turkey these news stories are incorrect and serve to confuse the public the youtube web site was blocked by a court decision and the ban can only be rescinded by another court decision
8978711 now i see that newspapers have been copying each others news without calling anybody in turkey to just ask if they could access the site again they would have said no youtube is still off line and then todays press anouncement would not have been necessary either it was officially stated that youtube was still banned
8978712 i really hope apple do use her in an advert
8978713 you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
8978714 we cannot believe that the planes bombing civilians in darfur can do that without his permission and approval
8978715 it is clear to everyone that our judicial system is not willing to or capable of trying those who committed crimes because of the lack of capacity of our lawyers and judges which results from their lack of independence
8978716 if he thinks he is innocent he should agree to stand trial because that is the only way to end the crisis facing the country
8978717 any report or article seeming to be or suspected of being supportive of the icc or the prosecutor will make the newspaper subject to suspension and the confiscation of its property
8978718 peaceful solution of the darfur issue through the initiative of the people of sudan with participation of all parties and respect of the government to all its regional and international commitments
8978719 al bashir cannot be defendant and judge at the same time
8978720 the government may have a crisis about al bashir and the icc one day but the next day there will be another crisis created by themselves which journalists will not be allowed to speak about
8978721 one crisis is taboo one week and another is taboo the week later there is no opening up of the press in terms of the icc but another crisis may take over importance the press should be free to reflect the views of the country but this is not the case
8978722 they may allow you to write a story one week but only if it serves their objectives censoring is a reality and journalists are not free
8978723 newspapers say the government attacked because there are weapons and drugs inside the camp but the media is under government control so they are going to say what the government says
8978724 the government wants to close down kalma camp because it is a threat unlike the al salam and sereif camps in nyala it is not government controlled and there is no police station inside the camp after the last one was burned in 2005 by idps
8978725 the only real information about the attacks is written by journalists from the international community in newspapers here they are saying only six people are dead
8978726 this is very embarrassing and even more difficult than people calling for al bashir to stand down because it comes at a time when the government is about to launch the sudanese peoples initiative
8978727 these are fringe parties with no influence within the political arena but more like pressure groups and the government does not think any move by them will create popular support amongst the main parties
8978728 they have to be careful in public to speak against him because they might disenfranchise members who feel solidarity with al bashir as muslims and arabs some do not understand that indicting the president is not indicting the country and make direct links between the head of state and the state itself
8978729 if al bashir is indicted he will not run for president which opens the way for silva kiir the umma party and the dup democratic unionist party will not condemn al bashir because they do not want a non muslim or non arab to win the presidency
8978730 this is why they might make a deal with al bashir on how to contest the next election

8978735 at the end of the day the consumer decides what they want to drink
8978736 no we just have coke water and iced tea or hot tea
8978737 im so tired of people blaming corporations for producing unhealthy food
8978738 if you dont like it dont eat it and most of all dont bitch to the entire world cause no one gives a hit if they were putting these dispensers in a kindergarten classroom i might agree with you
8978739 also by driving innovation like coke is doing they are actually reducing packaging waste i think is more efficent and beneficial to have one machine that can dispense 100 flavours instead of walking into a subway and choosing from 100 different bottled drinks in a fridge
8978740 anyways stop crying and go back to planting trees you environmental hippie douche

8978749 indeed it is so quiet that users dont notice the noise over other office monitors they wouldnt know it is on
8978750 organizations that select loco2pcs can expect to gain substantial payback through savings on their power bills estimated at 100 per pc every year
8978751 100 is not a controversial figure it is a conservative figure
8978752 in the worst case scenario when an organization is running old pcs that are left on overnight the annual savings could be as high as 250 especially if they dont have a sleep mode indeed the whole system could completely pay for itself in two to five years
8978753 basically it is going out the door before it gets in the door
8978754 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8978755 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8978756 internet maps can now be personalized allowing people to include landmarks and information that is of interest to them anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
8978757 these traditional landmarks are still on the map but people need to search for them interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it
8978758 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment

8978797 i thought shit its time to get out of here i tried to drive out of the area but i hit a red light on ladbroke grove i drove straight through
8978798 they were shouting abusive remarks at us such as why are you helping the black bastards you are a lot of nigger lovers a group of white youths shouted come on you fucking coppers if you want to fight a shower of bottles were thrown and smashed in the road in front of me
8978799 in one street where some of the ugliest fighting has taken place
8978800 your correspondent found a group of men in a public house singing ol man river and bye bye blackbird and punctuating the songs with vicious anti negro slogans the men said that their motto was keep britain white
8978801 just after a violent incident in which a coloured man was chased down a street by white youths
8978802 they shattered the whole concept of britain as the mother country
8978803 in a neighbourhood studded thickly with elegant villas and mansions
8978804 notting dale is a plague spot scarcely equalled for its insalubrity by any other in london
8978805 my dad was from shepherds bush my mum from notting hill
8978806 youd rob your own gas meter or cut off pieces of lino to shove in the meter until there was nothing left covering the floor
8978807 she helped bandage him her brother went mad and wouldnt talk to her for six months
8978808 right opposite my house were two knocking shops brothels and people didnt like it
8978809 one day three boys from nearby white city thought theyd do something and threw milk bottles at the windows
8978810 that the jews are the cause of the influx of coloured immigrants
8978811 there wasnt much difference between him and hitler he fucking hated everyone he hated foreigners wanted britain for the british
8978812 the riots started off with a false rumour that a black man had raped a white girl it was just fighting which grew bigger and everyone joined in we were bored
8978813 to think that britains history is one of only white working class racism towards black people is a nonsense race has been one of the key things in the whole of the history that makes britain great racism was at the heart of empire it was institutionalised by the ruling class
8978814 i sometimes feel like some masai village elder sitting outside my hut watching the new arrivals wondering if they know anything about what made this area what it is
8978815 now theyre our strongest allies ive got a black son in law and hes everything a husband and father should be
8978816 i went to a funeral the other day and they said youre always here i said its because im a notting hill lady and i show my respects there arent many of us left
8978817 our betting shops are gone theyve closed most of our caf s and pubs someone got very rich on notting hill
8978818 and when a story gets to you that gives you the energy to meet the challenges of turning it into a film it wasnt easy the fact that we started in 2001 and completed the film in 2007 gives you an idea of the problems we faced
8978819 his advice to me while i was making the film was to be careful because it was a difficult film he liked it a lot he said but it was very difficult
8978820 because oukili himself came not from the sewers but from a similar background it was a dream he realised through love and respect respect was one of the things he taught them but also perhaps learned from them because remember he himself was only 20 when he arrived only a little older than the children they grew up together
8978821 one which belongs to the distant past the fact that people are talking about such things again is a dangerous sign for europe

8978827 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8978828 it will go toward equipment maintenance and costs to continue operating the system
8978829 our costs are going up and we need to make sure we are putting enough capital in to cover the capital improvement program and to pay down those debts
8978830 the village decided to implement smaller increases rather than just one giant increase and another in five years because it is difficult to predict costs five years out
8978831 i am extremely honored to have been elected to this leadership position by my fellow state geologists
8978832 aasg represents our nations geological surveys which have an extremely important role to play in addressing many of the challenges that we face as a society supplying energy water and mineral resources to meet our future needs helping to understand and live with natural hazards such as earthquakes landslides and floods and dealing with climate change and its effects
8978833 although our geological surveys currently make significant contributions in addressing societal needs and challenges we have the potential to do much more as president it is my job to facilitate effective communication and coordination that allows aasg to fulfill its goals and objectives as we move into this future
8978834 we cant simply drill our way to energy independence if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has
8978835 hillary clinton gave a big speech at the democratic convention in support of barack obama experts say it was the longest speech ever delivered entirely through clenched teeth
8978836 she must prove she loves america as opposed to republicans who everyone knows love america they just hate half the people living in it
8978837 hillary gave a rousing speech it was so passionate emotional im telling you nancy pelosis face almost moved
8978838 and then earlier tonight her husband bill clinton spoke at the convention and what a great speech what a tremendous speech he got four standing ovations and five phone numbers
8978839 and speaker of the house nancy pelosi in her speech praised joe biden calling him the full package thats what she called him thats the actual term she used she called him the full package now hes getting phone calls from senator larry craig

8978887 some folks get spiritual cause they see the light some cause they feel the heat
8978888 it was most frustrating for us to leave prematurely without confirmed sightings of this elusive bird
8978889 it is evident from our records the real possibilities for groundbreaking research in this marine area
8978890 the most urgent priority remains locating and protecting the breeding grounds
8978891 we are now planning to find breeding locations by radio tracking adults back to their nest sites and by searching for nests using specially trained sniffer dogs

8978911 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8978912 the record is clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8978913 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8978914 and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8978915 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy thats his choice but it is not the change we need
8978916 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8978917 because ive seen it because ive lived it ive seen it in illinois when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work ive seen it in washington when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands
8978918 tras ese partido navajas se entreg y no tuvo la mejor actitud para seguir adelante en el resto de los compromisos
8978919 si bien es cierto que faltan muchas cosas nuestra realidad no es muy distinta a la del resto de sudam rica no hay tantas diferencias con el resto de los pa ses del rea por supuesto que tenemos carencias que deseamos tener m s posibilidades y m s recursos pero lo que tenemos sirve para preparar con gran altura a la selecci n nacional el gimnasio gast n portillo tiene todas las condiciones de primer nivel navajas exagera un poco
8978920 quer a que se le diera un carro 15 mil d lares de salario mensual y tres pasajes entre venezuela y brasil por mes para l y su familia eso era imposible para nosotros tenemos a seis selecciones nacionales en distintas categor as y cuatro de playa son muchas actividades para tan pocos recursos
8978921 falt centrarse en el juego y se dejaron llevar por la presi n lo que provoc que el equipo perdiera el norte en ese encuentro
8978922 pusieron demasiado peso sobre ellos y eso contribuy a que no estuvieran a la altura
8978923 un buen entrenador ser primordial para mantener el alto nivel de la selecci n nacional
8978924 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

8978930 things have not materialised the way we would have liked
8978931 i thought that there might have been something but circumstances have changed unless something jumps out at you which is what happens at this time of the year
8978932 someone you asked about who was 4m a couple of months ago will be thrown at you and you will asked if you want to take him on loan
8978933 but i could not be happier with muntari who has made me absolutely forget lampard
8978934 i just found out late last night that a bid had been accepted
8978935 so i came down last night and had a medical this morning and im delighted
8978936 ive been happy at the club on the field its been going well but i knew offers had come in through the summer i thought the best thing for me to do was that ask for a move
8978937 everything with the manager is fine but there were certain issues at the club i was looking for a move up in the contract to reflect the offers put in that were rejected
8978938 obviously the club decided to accept the request and sell me on
8978939 there was nothing from me saying im worth this to the club but i knew offers had come in over the summer and the clubs turned them down thats the clubs valuation and the players wages must reflect that value
8978940 it goes hand in hand but that chapter has gone
8978941 i enjoyed very much working with him it was fantastic and ive learned from him and enjoyed every minute playing for newcastle theyre a fantastic club

8978947 the operations been put on hold until we can assess the impact of this conflict on the integrity of this pipeline
8978948 while it is true that not all our requests were entertained we believe that under the current deficit situation it is understandable
8978949 we are of course still of the opinion that there must be some form of movement in tax rates for knowledge workers to stay or come into the country and we hope it will be addressed in the next budget
8978950 the emphasis on enhancing the well being of malaysians will be good for businesses as putting more money into the pockets of citizens will help to sustain domestic demand for good and services produced by the economy
8978951 from now i will say that the ball is in malaysias hand
8978952 so they are the ones who have to decide whether this deal can go on or not our stance remains the same
8978953 there are things that they maybank have to take care of but thats their business with bank negara so i think the ball is in bank negaras hand
8978954 however we remain bullish on our outlook as other business operations could balance and cushion the impact of short term weakening in cpo prices
8978955 our food and restaurant venture led by subsidiary qsr brands bhd is also expected to continue recording fair revenue and profits and maintain its contribution to the group as the market readjusts its spending following the higher cost of living felt earlier this year

8978973 there is going to be a lot going on this offseason
8978974 political and press offences will be tried openly and in the presence of a jury in courts of justice
8978975 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
8978976 i have stopped using a false name so i think all parties should do the same
8978977 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards this court
8978978 an old story by one of the worst mass murderers in the world

8978989 kimi steckt nicht in der krise niemand darf vergessen dass er ein weltmeister ist wir m ssen alle arbeiten um ihn in der lage zu versetzen vorne zu starten dies gilt vor allem f r die neuen rennstrecken die ich nicht mag und die f r die formel 1 nicht positiv sind weil man nicht berholen kann
8978990 die einzige hierarchie macht der chronometer aus unabh ngig vom piloten
8978991 war in den schnellen kurven mit offenem gas nicht gerade besonders stabil speziell in der kurve nach der gerade curvone und in der carro kurve dadurch gestaltet sich meine linie durch die kurven schwierig und ich muss meinen fahrstil anpassen ich kann die honda nicht so fahren wie ich gerne m chte und dadurch bin ich zu wenig konstant
8978992 nach schwierigen zeiten scheinen sie wieder ihr normales level erreicht zu haben
8978993 insgesamt haben wir ein gutes technisches paket aber f r schnelle strecken wie hier ist es wahrscheinlich nicht optimal geeignet
8978994 man musste sehr vorsichtig sein weil die strecke noch sehr rutschig war
8978995 what does a guy have to do to win this championship
8978996 but it shows the determination of the group that we have and the depth of the team we would not have won the race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to it is a testament to the organization we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
8978997 i think our approach this weekend is the same we go for broke
8978998 that is the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
8978999 im definitely looking forward to returning because after being really quick in practice and qualifying last year we got into some trouble during the race so i feel like i definitely have some unfinished business there

8979008 many of these plans will cost money and i will tell you how i will pay for them
8979009 the more it stays the same the less it changes
8979010 we must provide more ladders for young men that fall into crime and despair
8979011 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that is the essence of americas promise

8979023 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
8979024 governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops

8979037 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
8979038 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
8979039 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
8979040 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
8979041 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
8979042 when we first showed the film in new york the reception we received was overwhelming the cultural aspects of skateboarding we explore in the film make it something that you dont have to be a skater to enjoy
8979043 weve made some minor tweaks and cant wait to take it on the road to show it and skate in other cities
8979044 its only the second comp of the year so im sure charles reid will be biting at my heels after this contest

8979064 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8979065 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8979066 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8979067 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8979068 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8979069 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
8979070 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
8979071 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
8979072 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
8979073 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
8979074 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
8979075 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
8979076 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a state that matters to every one of us
8979077 in alaska governor palin challenged a corrupt system and passed a landmark ethics reform bill she has actually used her veto and cut budgetary spending she put a stop to the bridge to nowhere that would have cost taxpayers 400 million dollars
8979078 a maverick with a record of reform picks a maverick with a record of reform with this pick john mccain is putting washington on notice theres a shake up coming
8979079 after making experience a central issue of the race mccain picks on his 72nd birthday a peron who 3 years ago was the part time mayor of a city in alaska with a population of about 8 000 thats 1 20th the size of obamas state senate district that virtually takes the experience argument off the table shes also complimented obamas energy plan and is under investigation in her own state for pressuring the firing of a relative from the state safety department
8979080 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
8979081 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
8979082 the greatest benefit we get out of this beyond the food and the reduction in fuel costs is culture
8979083 when we import what we need from far away we import a national homogenized culture that rides on the backs of national homogenized products
8979084 the old system has to fail and the new system has to be created i believe the machinery to get those things to occur is already in the works four dollar gas spinach that gives people e coli giant recalls of the old system starting to fail and the new system starting to work includes things like the giant rise in the farmers market the success of the good food store mainstream newspapers having articles about local food locavore is the word of the year according to the 2007 new oxford american dictionary and michael pollans book is a best seller
8979085 but one half of the prerequisite is the old thing crashing and i hope it can happen in a gentle way
8979086 we need to be flexible to the world around us when people begin to criticize alternatives to the industrial system right away they jump to the extreme to show how ridiculous it is absolutely the extreme is ridiculous but were not advocating going there this is moderate careful conservative and not radical radical is shipping beef from argentina processing the cow right where it was grown thats not very radical

8979103 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8979104 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8979105 lets just say my foots got caught in the door
8979106 my focus is my training my focus is my next fight im not going to talk about retirement im not going to think about retirement i want to be 100 percent focused on the job ive got to take care of and well see after the fight how i feel
8979107 this fight will demonstrate to everyone that there is no sport universally as popular as boxing
8979108 i know everybody thinks this fight will be a difficult fight for me
8979109 i know some people say that its a very easy fight for oscar but i always do my job in the ring and ill do my best to give a good fight and to win this fight i think i can beat de la hoya in this bout i saw his last performance and i think im faster and stronger than him and im younger
8979110 a lot of people are going to be very surprised when were standing next to each other
8979111 size isnt going to be that much of a difference
8979112 i felt challenged especially from an expert trainer like that
8979113 he knows my style and he knows mannys and for him to say that was a big challenge
8979114 i have to find a way to increase my speed
8979115 were three months away and we have to figure out quick how were going to neutralize him its going to be an explosive fight were going to fight in the center of the ring
8979116 dan and i have worked together for over 12 years and with an outstanding team of leaders we have built gamestop into one of the fastest growing and most successful specialty retailers worldwide
8979117 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8979118 efforts by certain parties to destabilize the country by attempting to seize power through illegitimate means and without the mandate of the people must be rejected
8979119 i will not allow disturbances to continue i will not permit the mandate given by the people to be seized
8979120 would undermine the governments financial position and bequeath a bankrupt nation to the next generation
8979121 there are sweeteners here and there but it fails to address some fundamental flaws in economic policy issues of efficiency endemic corruption and governance
8979122 im going to guess that davidson will be the favorite in our league and that stephen curry will be the consensus preseason player of the year
8979123 what they did last year brought a lot of national attention and notoriety to our league
8979124 and they have been so good i was talking to charleston head coach bobby cremins and he said when i signed up for this two years ago nobody warned me about curry
8979125 so the rest of us coaches in the league can either whine and cry about it or work hard to pull ourselves to that level
8979126 we won our division but we didnt take care of our business in the tournament
8979127 weve got all the motivation we need to go out there and earn another shot
8979128 were the only team in the league thats beat them in the last two years
8979129 it was so exciting to see what they did last year i was cheering for them and i know how close we are to their level im just disappointed that we only get to play them once this year
8979130 our 20 0 was not an easy task last season
8979131 there were plenty of games that we could have lost if not for an opportune situation here or there you look at what this league did out of conference last year charleston beat temple appalachian beat arkansas wofford beat purdue on their home court there were plenty of indications that teams in the southern conference can play with anybody in the country
8979132 the most important thing for us is that he gets better he has a mindset that he wants to become a more well rounded player and hes worked at it very very hard
8979133 our coaches wanted to go back down to 16 that was a unanimous vote in our league
8979134 but it was shot down by the people above us the athletic directors were split on it but the presidents were pretty adamant about keeping things the way they are it gives them those 10 guaranteed home games
8979135 dangerously unprepared for the presidency with republican national committee ads labeling obama as
8979136 but maybe thats the good news said the seasoned republican senator from texas who was said to be among mccains potential running mates
8979137 the fact that she doesnt know the ways of washington may be the best of all hutchison said in an interview aired by cnn calling palin an
8979138 hell be following the presidential camapign from afar sarah palin said in her appearance with mccain in ohio today with palin citing her pride in him and
8979139 pro life cause which mccain has pledged to make a central concern of his administration she was not dissuaded by prenatal testing of the child and has said of him
8979140 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8979141 preparedness for the presidency will have to be addressed with a certain recognition that mccain has tapped someone who might have to stand in as president who carries a lack of national credentials unseen in a long time
8979142 architect of president bushs election campaigns dismissed his experience a governor for three years and mayor of 103rd largest richmond
8979143 we have a 72 year old nominee of the republican party and the vice presidency this is a position of a heart beat away and how are people going to feel about sarah palin in that situation
8979144 but ill tell you theres going to be a lot of questions about whether somebody who was the mayor of wasilla alaska just three years ago whether shes ready to be commander in chief
8979145 gov sarah palin is a bold and energetic choice for sen john mccains running mate in her time as alaskas governor she has been a solid conservative true reformer and a powerful voice for families
8979146 facing corruption charges is still in the middle of a recount for their republican primary
8979147 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future
8979148 thats just the way it is its just racing i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
8979149 i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made id do it again
8979150 thats one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me hes raced me that way and thats the reason it went down like that in the back of my mind all i could think about was richmond in a nationwide race when he was trying to get through the field and pile drove me
8979151 i never thought id be single at this time of my life
8979152 and with that in mind i still want to work i still want to keep my hand in it
8979153 because i dont have to work 365 days of material into the year i can take some of the time off that i want

8979162 i think they were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters they were asking for more money and more money and more money and talking just about money
8979163 money money money the americans and british said you have to satisfy the families to lift the sanctions we said we are responsible but it doesnt mean we did it
8979164 i dont regard the money as compensation you cant compensate for people you love
8979165 for the libyans it was a business deal to recover their oil industry and thats what happened
8979166 no society is able to respond appropriately to events if it lacks a dynamic and reflective relation with its own past the danish cartoons crisis was a prime example of this with denmark fumbling in the dark on islam to understand religions today you have to know their history and that is the aim of this new study programme
8979167 without knowing all the details i would think this is probably the wrong initiative it is an attempt to rescue theology by introducing comparative religious history

8979178 the good news is that they want the playbook for virtually everything else we do

8979180 jaws is one of the most credible and well liked football analysts out there not just by fans but by teams and players as well
8979181 i think we were not quite aligned with tony when we brought him on the show three years ago
8979182 i think our group inherited what we were used to as the pti tony what we really didnt put our attention on was an award winning columnist who brings incredible information incredible depth incredible perspective and humor to the booth
8979183 last year in the biggest and best moments we had tony always heightened the moment

8979186 we dont index every one of those trillion pages many of them are similar to each other or represent auto generated content similar to the calendar example that isnt very useful to searchers
8979187 google downloads the web continuously collecting updated page information and re processing the entire web link graph several times per day this graph of one trillion urls is similar to a map made up of one trillion intersections so multiple times every day we do the computational equivalent of fully exploring every intersection of every road in the united states except itd be a map about 50 000 times as big as the u s with 50 000 times as many roads and intersections

8979196 in a year from now what do you think the stepforth blog will be writing about
8979197 as we move forward into 2009 and beyond i think the stepforth blog will only change in a minor way we will likely still have all the same tutorial type articles and latest search engine news but we will probably have more content on areas such as social media and analytics while we touch on these topics now they will likely take up more of the spotlight into the future

8979217 let us hope that this time the police and the cps are going to pursue the real criminals in this matter the government introduced the racial and religious hatred act to protect muslims from hatred but who is going to protect everyone else from the hate mongering going on in even britains supposedly most respectable mosques let the police and cps demonstrate to the public that the religiously aggravated and hatred offences are not off limits to any section of the community

8979250 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
8979251 the industry wide shift to higher household energy prices is now complete all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy

8979324 her name wasnt mentioned it came down to the tim pawlentys the mitt romneys but i think that whatever bounce the obama campaign gets and they will its going to be deflated quickly with sarah palin when shes introduced
8979325 last night senator barack obama had a chance to address all the sexism and misogyny that was leveled in this campaign against hillary clinton and he chose not to take that
8979326 so in terms of sitting well with women on the democratic side we see that john mccain gets it john mccain selected a qualified woman with a lot of experience and accomplishments to be his running mate as opposed to barack obama who chose against the person that got more votes than anyone in history so i think that thats actually whats sitting poorly with women right now
8979327 actually when you look at sarah palin you see that she is a family woman shes a mother of five you see that in alaska she has an incredibly strong record as a reformer
8979328 so i think thats where peoples concern is going to be that its a person with accomplishment and experience whos been chosen she just happens to be a woman as well

8979367 moderation will continue for at least for two more quarters factoring the further tightening by rbi however we do not expect gdp to fall below 8 per cent in 2008 09 the consumption demand both from consumer and government is still strong which should support the manufacturing sector savings are also satisfactory and is reflected in growth of construction sector in this quarter 11 4 against 7 7 a year ago
8979368 growth in agriculture holds the key as a good season would increase demand for other products from industrial and service sectors boosting the economy the slight slowdown in service sector is an area of concern but we would like to watch the figures for one more quarter
8979369 domestic funds and foreign institutions both turned buyers after months we saw inflation climbing down and gdp numbers were also in line with expectations the good thing is volumes were high that shows interest returning back into the market now the nsg meet will be keenly watched we are expecting short term uptrend in the market

8979382 weve had an excellent week of work and all the players have worked very hard in training
8979383 were aware of the fact we need to start getting points on the board and i think having a game like chelsea at this time gives us a great chance to lift the spirits around the club
8979384 we know well be playing against one of the top sides in the league but that often spurs you on to get a result and we know we can play well against them
8979385 if you go to chelsea and try to put everyone behind the ball its likely that the game will end in defeat
8979386 the game plan should be to go there and play with an ambitious attacking style of football without fear and show a lot of character thats the way forward when playing chelsea
8979387 its been fairly even in recent games between the sides we lost at stamford bridge last season but won the carling cup final and then we drew at the lane
8979388 its going to be a close run affair this time and the team that takes its chances on the day will be the one who prevails

8979394 were really making sure we focus on things that have a payback
8979395 historically weve done science projects trying to figure out some nuance of aerodynamics that doesnt fit the rules right now but that someday we may be able to apply if the rules change
8979396 now were really just focused more on things that have a tangible benefit short term or in the near to mid term on the racetrack thats the biggest change we havent narrowed our focus but weve really just shifted it
8979397 it used to be where most of the cars entered had one single sponsor for all season
8979398 you can count those on one hand now it takes multiple sponsors to get to a point where youre going to get a car fully funded
8979399 but the flip side is that nascars tv ratings have gone up through the season
8979400 as your attendance at the track goes down the viewership at home actually goes up and they do see the brand they do see the ford nameplate
8979401 we are very very close the player is coming here everybody knows because espanyol have put on their website that he is coming for a medical we are very very close but he has not signed yet
8979402 he has experience in the premier league and that is really important
8979403 if everything is okay we can talk about his qualities but for now we will just say he is the option we are looking for

8979488 i have no regrets at all what i did i did because hair darrel had called us cheats he called pakistani cricketers cheats it was a slur on our team and nation and i cant tolerate that
8979489 even the icc match referee adjudicator ranjan madugalle who is an experienced referee said later at the hearing that hair had acted in haste and he didnt use his authority properly
8979490 i will say again if this incident was to happen again i would do the same thing hair called us cheats and the icc adjudicator later cleared us of the same charge
8979491 at times national honour is more important than victories or defeats in that match i stood up for pakistan cricket
8979492 im concerned that the disease could be circulating in the uk but despite that fact and the emergence of fresh cases the uptake of vaccine has begun to slow
8979493 this is worrying farmers away from the south of england seem to think that bluetongue is too far away from them to be their problem
8979494 my advice to them is to think again we dont have the surveillance to tell us whether the virus is circulating
8979495 it could be that the virus is prevalent and we are just not picking it up because stock are protected and so not showing clinical signs of the disease
8979496 if your stock are protected you are okay if they are not they could become infected that could allow the disease to gain a foothold and become endemic in the uk we will not beat it if that is the case
8979497 better information on where the animals have come from and what risk is represented is vital
8979498 if importers must bring in stock they should not accept word of mouth affirmation from suppliers that the animals carry no bluetongue risk and protect their reputations and their own cattle by insisting on a vaccination certificate that has been signed by a vet
8979499 france has already declared that btv8 is endemic this summer but it is alarming that no cases from the region in germany where these eight imported heifers originated have been picked up by the authorities or reported by farmers
8979500 the first of last years bluetongue cases was not confirmed in britain until late september and there is a huge danger that many livestock farmers have been lulled into complacency and delayed vaccination because new disease has still to be reported here in 2008

8979522 i therefore urge farmers who have not yet ordered vaccine from their vets to do so immediately it is expected that vaccine supplies will become available within days with further batches arriving over the coming weeks

8979552 in fact all the charges were municipal court violations that do not carry such penalties
8979553 it is not clear whether any order to disperse was given no legal observer sic witness or arrestee on the scene weve debriefed heard any order to disperse
8979554 numerous persons including legal observers asked to be able to leave the blockaded area and were refused
8979555 after the arrests attorneys from the peoples law project and the aclu arrived at the temporary arrestee processing site to conduct confidential attorney client consultations
8979556 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
8979557 perhaps the most outrageous charge however is that one protester was forced to march barefoot into court in leg shackles
8979558 i personally saw one such arrestee later at the city and county building
8979559 some arrestees who could not make their own bond spent 6 7 8 or more hours waiting at taps before being transferred to court
8979560 the only access we were given to those clients was to whisper

8979573 self confessed mastermind of the september 11 attacks on the us
8979574 has traced the origin of the funding of 9 11 back to financial accounts in pakistan where high ranking and well known al qaeda operatives played a major role in moving the money forward eventually into the hands of the hijackers located in the us
8979575 on the eve of the publication of its report the 9 11 commission was given a stunning document from pakistan claiming that pakistani intelligence officers knew in advance of the 9 11 attacks
8979576 pakistan gave tens of thousands of dollars through its lobbyists in the united states to members of the 9 11 inquiry commission to convince them to drop some anti pakistan findings in the report
8979577 pakistan has never indulged in the illegal activity of bribing or buying influence anywhere in the world

8979613 drug release from polymeric materials often follows a burst first order kinetic profile which may not be clinically desired

8979615 microencapsulating the drug enabled the use of simple molding processes to fabricate devices containing tens of thousands of microreservoirs and the devices exhibit constant drug release profiles equivalent to traditional reservoir devices this approach greatly simplifies production and adds tremendous flexibility to both single and multi drug devices

8979701 i do not expect negative fallout for my business in russia nor do i expect such in dealings with gazprom as a result of the current tensions in ties between russia and the eu eni and gazprom have been doing business together over the past 50 years and the gas supply by gazprom has never been interrupted or reduced both companies are currently working on the south stream project to pump russian gas to europe
8979702 russia shall remain a reliable supplier of oil and gas to europe
8979703 the situation is quite clear during the present global economic crisis russia serves as a calm harbour russia has suffered less than some other advanced nations from the instability on the global financial markets hence it is understandable that a significant part of the western business community desires to cooperate with russia more actively on the whole the current political crisis over happenings in the caucasus has nothing in common with the cold war years because during those years the war was between two fundamentally different political and social systems but russia is now a part of the world economic system and globalisation dictates to businessmen new rules of the game
8979704 european politicians are gradually coming to terms with the new realities despite their fretting over russian actions in the caucasus the eu should reopen as quickly as possible real dialogue with russia because both sides want to have normal ties especially in economic and energy matters

8979731 i thought the sessions were great and very educational the attendance was very good considering the weather the kennedy space center sponsored lunch was my favorite standout moment
8979732 two things i was particularly impressed with were one about a week before the conference the team sent out a reminder to all attendees with environment friendly tips to follow two the green faq feature on the web site which also helped attendees and participants practice green behaviors throughout the entire conference
8979733 i was privileged enough to speak at the conference on emotional intelligence appropriately enough i think it took a great deal of emotional intelligence for the conference leaders to take action during such a crisis with the weather i didnt witness any panic or disarray though and the organizational team was very poised
8979734 i found the conference to be very meaty with a lot to offer my favorite part was the general session with keynote speaker linda larson

8979740 anees bhai is keeping tight lipped about the entire offer since he would rather sign on the dotted line before making any declaration of sorts however the fact is that the day singh is kinng was released and declared a success on the basis of sheer opening he has been inundated with offers by one and all so many producers out there just want him to take up their projects and are not even worried about the figure he may quote however one such offer that seems to be in serious contention has come from a top corporate house
8979741 not just that anees bhai has been offered 51 crores to direct three films and given full freedom to pick subjects and actors of his choice over a period of time he has also been extended flat 21 crores as a signing amount it is an unheard of money and quite unprecedented something of this scale has never happened before for a bollywood director but anees bhais track record has forced producers to talk big money
8979742 it wont be fair on my part to comment on the number part since it is best left to be announced by the people who are making an offer in any case temptations like these arent new to me because ever since

8979909 nobody loves a war better than the president and a few years ago it got to the point where if i said anything i truly believed about the iraq war or global warming during a concert people would get up and leave thats fine with me actually its a badge of honour
8979910 little by little it became clear that bush was bizarre and dangerous
8979911 i would do concerts where i would see people in the audience sitting with their arms crossed looking angry as i said i was right 40 years ago and i am right now and throw my fist in the air now theyre listening bushs great trick is to suggest that to go against him is to be unpatriotic slowly people realised that

8979915 the vietnamese developed all sorts of neuroses and phobias after the war ended because they were no longer spending every day in the heightened state that comes with not knowing if youre going to be killed or not when the war ended a lot of us lost direction i certainly did
8979916 i had this great fear of going commercial as a result of becoming well known at such a young age i was afraid of the wider world but i did also have deeply held beliefs that i clung on to tenaciously the big event was meeting martin luther king in 1956 at a quaker seminar that pretty much shaped the direction my life took
8979917 they laughed all the time and told racist jokes about themselves and i realised that nobody could see that side of them they had to be seen as serious and i related to that we got to a restaurant and i asked them dont you have a big march to organise they said we just have you get a public image that you have to live up to but your private reality is often very different
