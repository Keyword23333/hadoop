2520000 again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant on the lookout for choice pearls when he discovered a pearl of great value he sold everything he owned and bought it
2520001 the seed that fell among the thorns represents those who hear gods word but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life and the lure of wealth so no fruit is produced
2520002 jesus told him if you want to be perfect go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me but when the young man heard this he went away sad for he had many possessions
2520003 no one can serve two masters for you will hate one and love the other you will be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money
2520004 dont store up treasures here on earth where moths eat them and rust destroys them and where thieves break in and steal store your treasures in heaven where moths and rust cannot destroy and thieves do not break in and steal wherever your treasure is there the desires of your heart will also be
2520005 a rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops he said to himself what should i do i dont have room for all my crops then he said i know ill tear down my barns and build bigger ones then ill have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods and ill sit back and say to myself my friend you have enough stored away for years to come now take it easy eat drink and be merry but god said to him you fool you will die this very night then who will get everything you worked for yes a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with god
2520006 god blesses those who are humble for they will inherit the whole earth
2520007 i am the way the truth and the life no one can come to the father except through me
2520008 come you who are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world for i was hungry and you fed me i was thirsty and you gave me a drink i was a stranger and you invited me into your home i was naked and you gave me clothing i was sick and you cared for me i was in prison and you visited me
2520009 god blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers be happy about it be very glad for a great reward awaits you in heaven
2520010 god blesses those who are persecuted for doing right for the kingdom of heaven is theirs
2520011 you know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people and officials flaunt their authority over those under them but among you it will be different whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave for even the son of man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many
2520012 and if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers you will surely be rewarded
2520013 i assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property for my sake and for the good news will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses brothers sisters mothers children and property along with persecution and in the world to come that person will have eternal life but many who are the greatest now will be least important then and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then
2520014 that is what the scriptures mean when they say no eye has seen no ear has heard and no mind has imagined what god has prepared for those who love him
2520015 for god loved the world so much that he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life
2520016 zie voor ons dit zou een mooi uitgestrekte strakblauwe zee moeten zijn maar ik zie het niet ik voel het niet het is heel warm er zou een strakblauwe heldere hemel zijn met een intens mooie zon die straalt ik voel het niet jij zit hier op een rots met mij op je hand er zouden veel bloemen en een waanzinnig uitzicht moeten zijn maar ik ruik ze niet zie het niet

2520025 the president of the brazilian soccer confederation ricardo teixeira accepted the brazilian olympic committees request that the olympic team did not wear the official jersey because it would blemish brazils bid to host the 2016 olympics
2520026 the ioc determines that we shouldnt use any national identification in the jersey only the colors of the country and the olympic arcs
2520027 teixeira decided to accept the committees request to avoid any embarrassment or inconveniences to the citys bid for 2016
2520028 all the players and the brazilian people are proud of the jersey with the five stars on it

2520038 this tournament is not going to be won by 1 under par
2520039 its such a tough golf course that they dont need to trick it up
2520040 the fairways are running 30 to 40 yards the greens are like concrete its not enjoyable to play theyve taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap
2520041 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
2520042 nothing is ever going to get as tough as royal birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
2520043 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
2520044 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away
2520045 i had to make the olympics again to try and get the gold medal im feeling so good and theres not so much pressure now
2520046 last year i had problems with my stomach this year im very healthy i feel stronger so if i make the team in the 1 500 im going to pursue the 1 500 very hard because thats my goal
2520047 i made a promise to my parents especially my mother
2520048 i told her i am going to win the gold i talked to her right after i got my silver she said you were third in 2000 now you are second in 2004 the next time is going to be yours to bring the gold
2520049 my sister was a leader from the beginning she respected my dad and mum but she was a leader

2520052 i wanted to be the one flying in the air like her seeing white people i had only seen one white person and that was my priest i think he was from
2520053 my sister said she would support me she said i am paying your school fees all you have to do is study and you will realise your dream of going to america
2520054 i feel enormous pride running for the united states it means a lot to me i have received a lot of support from this country

2520065 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2520066 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2520067 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2520068 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2520069 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2520070 then i told the deputy director you go and pull him out there

2520074 ive been working hard in practice to make sure im ready even though ive raced sparingly
2520075 my coach bobby kersee and i debated running the 200m in london because i was feeling fatigued so when i came off the curve and realized i couldnt shift to another gear i just cruised in as to prevent injury
2520076 i made the decision to skip the 100m the next day and go home to get some much needed rest and sharpness back
2520077 im just working on specific areas in my race now im emphasizing my start and working on my curve running along with keeping up my endurance
2520078 i handle the expectations by focusing on myself and my inner circle
2520079 i never take my concentration off my goals and what i need to do to accomplish them
2520080 my body is very heavy so many of the maneuvers are hard to complete
2520081 sometimes i cant do my best but that happens very rarely

2520085 if he didnt want to marry me then he never will more time to get to know each other is just more time to come up with more reasons why im not the one for him
2520086 i dont mean it to be petty its just that i spent a lot of money and time and work on that scarf and it means a lot to me it meant something to me to give it to you but now you dont love me anymore so why would you want to keep it

2520098 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2520099 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2520100 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2520101 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2520437 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
2520438 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982

2520440 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano

2520443 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2520444 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2520445 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2520446 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2520447 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2520448 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2520449 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2520450 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
2520451 un interlocutor v lido que en este caso ser a o el ministro de gobierno jorge tobares o alg n funcionario de alto rango con poder de decisi n
2520452 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2520453 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2520454 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas

2520463 results continue to show improvement and we are performing essentially in line with our revised business plan budget legal and professional fees continue to have a negative impact on operating results with such costs aggregating 330 thousand during the recent quarter
2520464 i am pleased that our total average cost of funds is continuing to decline to 4 25 for the 2nd quarter 2008 it is down from 4 82 during the 2nd quarter 2007 we will continue to reduce these costs by attracting core deposit accounts through our enhanced calling programs remote deposit capture program and compensating balances from commercial loan customers

2520476 wer so argumentiert wei nicht wovon er spricht oder er sagt absichtlich die unwahrheit
2520477 play at a high level it is possible to unlock more than one
2520478 turn off your air conditioners when youre not at home
2520479 without treatment approximately 90 of persons living with hiv aids die within a few months of developing tb
2520480 one of the great tragedies of this epidemic is that people who are living with hiv after hard fought battles for access to antiretroviral treatment go on to die needlessly from tb
2520481 what we have is the sense of real slippage that well you know it may not be 2010 and it probably will be 2015 as if that doesnt matter
2520482 lower prices at the pump by increasing offshore drilling here at home
2520483 i cant deny it was an important issue there are very few players who left me against my will
2520484 madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here
2520485 he has got four years left on his contract and at some point we would like to extend it
2520486 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2520487 were happy he has explained himself perfectly from my perspective and the matter is closed he is a manchester united player
2520488 the player is happy to be a manchester united player he has always been happy to be here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him
2520489 the important thing is we ended all this stuff about real madrid as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more that happens with players the longer they stay here they dont ever want to leave
2520490 i want his socks and his shorts and then ill forgive him
2520491 hes obviously in the process of learning the differences in rugby union and rugby league
2520492 bit by bit hell pick them up rugby league is perhaps more aggressive than union
2520493 when he came to centre he got a bit more ball tonight the toulon public have discovered an amazing player who is going to play for us in the top 14
2520494 the two or three balls he did get he showed great enthusiasm the supporters really appreciated that and were hoping to get a lot more from him as well
2520495 they like to be in your face and i suppose they like the rough stuff a little bit more than at home
2520496 thats the sonny special hes got to learn to wrap his arms around i guess if the rugby league boys saw it theyd probably think the rugby union boys are a bit soft but thats the rules
2520497 it might have been a fatigue factor but now that the origin period is over there are no excuses i need to take my game to an extra level
2520498 to be quite honest the only blokes that matter to me are the ones in the coaching box and the rest of the boys in storm jumpers
2520499 willie masons been a stalwart in the representative teams for a very very long time hes a high quality player and a big game player
2520500 we certainly didnt personally serve him prior to the match even though we believe his conduct and his statements are consistent with him knowing of it
2520501 therefore the court will be looking at future conduct rather than last night well be drawing it to the courts attention if he plays again
2520502 its one thing not to comply with an obligation you have in a contract its another thing altogether to defy an order of the court
2520503 the bulldogs and the nrl have no real choice but to pursue the matter further
2520504 im not saying anything i havent said anything about breaking any record
2520505 i would say he has a great chance of doing it
2520506 i would expect you are going to see him win by margins and set times that have never been done before hell be unbelievable
2520507 every time i do lose to him it makes me want to get back in the water and work even harder
2520508 the biggest advantage he has now is that hes been through this before he knows what lies ahead
2520509 ive got to get some blood tests to make sure i dont have anything too serious
2520510 my swing was horrible i didnt hit many fairways therefore i didnt hit many greens so i never had chances for birdie
2520511 in the end i was pleased with my score because it was so difficult out there
2520512 we flew on the exact flight that we took last year after we experimented with the effects of the jet lag
2520513 china is six hours in front of europe so its not too bad
2520514 the flights worked really well and none of us suffered too greatly from the flight we collected a lot of data and now it feels awesome to be going back there as the olympic champion
2520515 we believe weve done what we can to eliminate the chance of getting sick weve been training at the right time of the day we think weve done everything right for the race and we have a very strong team
2520516 its quite a long climb but when we were in beijing and on the course last year i didnt suffer at all from the air conditions
2520517 theres a certain specialness to head back four years later as defending champion
2520518 its a different race and ill be lining up in a team of three doing our best again to win
2520519 i know just how incredible it feels to be on that podium to taste that drives you even harder now i have all these people wanting to steal what i have experienced
2520520 in road cycling it is impossible to say i am going to win but i have the form the confidence to do it
2520521 i feel fantastic everything has come together at the right moment
2520522 it was such a high and then i struggled with it
2520523 i had to take time away in 2005 i struggled a lot with motivational problems and in 2006 i had the year off because i just needed to have a break for a little while
2520524 then 2007 was all about trying to come back to the top level and it took all year to do that
2520525 i guess what has been hard is that i was crowned olympic champion four years ago but i have not been able to do anything since that has been able to back that up
2520526 i hope there is a group 1 in him by the end of the spring
2520527 we prepared him for it we gave him a barrier trial a few jump outs but i was still worried about the 1200m first up to his credit he fought it out well stavka runner up is rock hard fit and in form so he did a good job
2520528 ross has been very good to me he looked after me again today
2520529 his newmarket run behind weekend hussler was very good and stavka is racing really well and was always going to be tough to beat but in the end we were too good
2520530 he needed the run that is all there is to it he was just too soft but his action was good
2520531 in all fairness to the horse people just expect him to come out and win but its not always the case
2520532 he was on his toes a bit he jumped out and travelled well behind them i peeled him off to test him but he was just one paced and got tired
2520533 he went super he relaxed travelled really good and was a bit unfortunate that playwright didnt take us into the race he stopped him and dragged him back a little bit but when he got balanced up he finished off his last furlong really strongly
2520534 it was very difficult obviously but i made it more so
2520535 i got off to a bad start and unfortunately i kept it going
2520536 sorry i didnt think you looked like european captain nick faldo
2520537 the obstacles created by jammu and kashmir in the amarnath pilgrimage land allotment is not their own the decision of cancelling land allotment to the sasb taken by the governor of jammu and kashmir is not his own he has just carried out the orders of new delhi there should be no confusion about that and we will continue our struggle against the double standards adopted by government
2520538 i am confident that the revered amarnath shrine board will get back the land and i want to assure the people of jammu that the bjp will extend its full support to the sass in its campaign for the land across the country
2520539 alcuni amici mi hanno regalato un boomerang che non funzionava racconta quando si rotto ne ho acquistato uno migliore e ho iniziato ad appassionarmi
2520540 i pi bravi sono i tedeschi gli statunitensi i francesi ed alcuni svizzeri dice maurizio saba gli australiani non sono tra i favoriti per quanto ci riguarda saremo l per partecipare e fare esperienza
2520541 io e lui siamo grandi amici ci siamo inventati un personaggio mentalmente disturbato
2520542 un film completamente diverso da tutto quello che ho fatto prima una bella sfida
2520543 secondo me ha delle somiglianze con 21 grammi la storia di un uomo di successo benestante un uomo che con leggerezza e distrazione viveva una vita serena e anche molto felice che in un gravissimo incidente stradale uccide per errore sette persone tra cui la sua fidanzata entra in un tunnel depressivo dal quale riesce ad uscire solo con un piano perverso quanto folle e cio uccidersi e donare i suoi organi a 7 persone il problema che finir per innamorarsi della persona cui deve donare il suo cuore ne deriva una stora damore tragicissima fra will smith e rosario dawson e anche molto emozionante il titolo seven pounds sette libbre si riferisce alle sette persone sette anime sette organi sette pesi
2520544 si lo scrittore si ispirato alla vicenda di un impiegato della nasa che si sent responsabile dellesplosione dello shuttle in cui morirono sette astronauti costruendoci sopra una trama fittizia la sony lo aveva offerto a will che non si sentiva di farlo solo quando ho dimostrato interesse anchio che will ha accettato insomma siamo entrati insieme in unavventura spaventosamente ambiziosa pericolosa scivolosa un film particolare e anche difficile ma la potenza della storia per me era tale che il pericolo dellimpresa non mi ha spaventato abbastanza anzi mi ci sono tuffato dentro
2520545 mandava un messaggio dal cellulare un banale telefonino una cosa che soprattutto qui a los angeles fanno tutti ma potrebbe essere qualsiasi citt del mondo il film il tragitto di un uomo che non pu convivere con il senso di colpa di aver tolto la vita a sette persone e quindi sente di aver perso il senso della propria esistenza ma la sua anima viene riscattata da un atto damore che lo riporta su un piano esistenziale diverso mette in moto un atto damore che lo aiuta a farlo sentire vivo a fargli credere che la sua vita non stata inutile secondo me il film ha una tragicit e un romanticismo pazzesco che il motivo per cui ho voluto entrare in questavventura comunque un film che non ho mai visto prima e molto vero
2520546 altroch per prepararmi al film ho passato un sacco di tempo in sale operatorie e ho frequentato chirurghi per capire meglio il mondo dei trapianti e incredibile quanta gente oggi viva grazie al trapianto di un cuore un rene il fegato o un pezzo di polmone il trapianto di un cuore unesperienza miracolosa e quasi religiosa cui io non avrei mai pensato di assistere
2520547 si accanto al chirurgo in diretta per essere trapiantato il cuore deve battere ancora quando lo prendono dal donatore quando lo mettono nel corpo della persona che lo riceve ricuciono le arterie il sangue entra nel cuore inanimato e lui si rimette a battere da solo senza nessun impulso elettrico n aiuto esterno si colora da grigio diventa sempre pi rosso batte allinizio irregolarmente poi trova il suo ritmo veramente sembra che ci sia la mano di dio ero commosso
2520548 will cambiato come attore rispetto alla ricerca della felicit una storia con cui in qualche modo lui che la povert lha conosciuta davvero si era molto identificato in questo film ci siamo dovuti inventare completamente un personaggio mentalmente disturbato disperatamente ossessionato dal bisogno di aiutare gli altri io e will ci siamo chiusi in una stanza per cinque settimane a leggere e capire il copione a incontrare specialisti abbiamo scoperto giorno dopo giorno che questo non era solo un film ma una storia di tante persone il personaggio molto profondo e anche molto nobile e will ha saputo portarlo sullo schermo in modo stupefacente
2520549 s proprio come fanno gli americani ho finalmente capito come fanno a far volare le macchine ci mettono sotto due cannoni con lesplosivo ovviamente le guidano stuntman che spesso muoiono non come in italia dove usiamo delle rampe qui le macchine esplodono proprio nel nostro caso lo stuntman rimasto 45 minuti senza riprendere la conoscenza dopo il salto e abbiamo letteralmente distrutto cinque corvette anni 60 ma stata unesperienza cinematografica incredibile e nonostante abbia alle spalle uno studio come la columbia penso di aver fatto il film con lo spirito indipendente del cinema europeo
2520550 certo e finalmente vedo che qualcosa si sta muovendo finalmente non sento la mancanza asfissiante di leggerezza e di incoscienza nellaffrontare il cinema unautoreferenza di chi pretendeva di essere un autore che per anni ha impolverato la scena italiana ho sempre amato paolo virz e considero matteo garrone e paolo sorrentino due artisti e altri ne verranno fuori hanno una freschezza e un coraggio espressivo che tanti altri autori e registi in italia non hanno e che finalmente comincia ad emergere
2520551 proprio in una fase delicata del paese era arrivata per antonio la tempesta giudiziaria e della sua malattia ha detto il monsignore ma lui ha sempre avuto rispetto delle istituzioni ed stato assolto
2520552 colpito dalle ingiustizie degli uomini e della malattia ma la verit cammina con passo normale mentre le bugie volano
2520553 un uomo di governo efficiente tra i pi capaci e dotati e segnato dallumilt contrariamente a quello che stato detto e scritto di lui
2520554 ho lavorato con il padre e con lui stata una famiglia che ha avuto un ruolo ottimo nella politica italiana provo una certa profonda emozione per questa perdita
2520555 la sofferenza per tredici anni di accuse che gli stessi tribunali hanno riconosciuto infondate
2520556 ma quale vicer ha detto scotti in unintervista a il tempo il potere che si aveva allora era nettamente inferiore a quello che hanno ora sindaci e governatori e un termine davvero ridicolo e pensare che la legislazione antimafia quella che ha condizionato la vera lotta alla mafia ha i primi segnali proprio nel periodo in cui gava fu ministro dellinterno
2520557 did you guys adopt a baby thats really nice of you

2520579 hemos venido a pek n a jugar a ense ar a todo el mundo lo que sabemos hace y cual es el nivel de nuestro voleibol somos conscientes de que hay equipo mejores pero nosotras nos iremos satisfechas sea cual sea la clasificaci n final que obtengamos si jugamos como sabemos y lo damos todo en la pista
2520580 as es la vida y hay que tomarla como llega nosotras hemos salido sin presi n a jugar el partido pero las chinas han demostrado que son mejores y nos han ganado con claridad lo hemos intentado adem s tambi n hemos tenido que jugar en una instalaci n tan grande y con tanto p blico somos j venes y nos falta experiencia en este tipo de situaciones
2520581 lo mejor de este equipo es la unidad que hay entre todas nosotras hemos tenido que superar muchas dificultades para clasificarnos para los juegos ol mpicos y eso nos ha unido m s todav a por eso pase lo que pase y tengamos el resultado que tengamos seguimos anim ndonos en la pista para intentar mejorar
2520582 no pudimos descifrar el juego r pido de las chinas
2520583 las muchachas no pudieron descifrar el juego r pido de las jugadoras chinas y en ning n momento tuvimos opci n alguna ante su gran bloqueo y el eficaz juego de ataque que desplegaron las actuales campeonas ol mpicas
2520584 estamos orgullosos de haber llegado hasta aqu y de haber debutado en unos juegos ol mpicos no podemos estar satisfechos con la derrota pero adem s de la juventud tambi n hay que tener en cuenta que las chicas tampoco est n acostumbradas a jugar en canchas tan grandes y ante 13 000 aficionados que animaron a las jugadoras locales todo lo ten amos en contra
2520585 venimos a competir a aprender a mejorar y a mostrar al mundo el nivel del voleibol femenino venezolano estoy satisfecho porque las jugadoras demostraron que pueden llegar alto en el futuro en cuanto a nuestro objetivo lo marcar amos en no acabar los ltimos y ser noveno o d cimo ser a un gran resultado
2520586 un hola y me voy porque me est n siguiendo los chinos
2520587 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2520588 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2520589 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2520590 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2520591 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2520592 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2520593 muy luchado con muchas situaciones pero pudimos convertir y a partir de ah avanzamos con mucha m s soltura
2520594 pero sabemos que sigue siendo un rival duro con un poder o f sico importante y que tenemos que tener cuidado m s que nada con eso porque nosotros apostamos m s a jugar al f tbol que a lo f sico
2520595 cada uno tiene que tratar de vivir su propia experiencia
2520596 ahora lo principal es tratar de clasificar y despu s se van a ir definiendo solos los candidatos creo que tenemos que tener la inteligencia para clasificar
2520597 ma ana si es posible mucho mejor y despu s sabemos que hay algunos equipos que se perfilan pero en el f tbol puede pasar cualquier cosa
2520598 no es un grupo que escuche especialmente a los mayores sino que todo el mundo trata de aportar su punto de vista porque hay jugadores que tienen 20 21 22 a os pero tienen mucha experiencia

2520601 a drug that holds back the ageing process and prevents cancer heart disease and alzheimers could be on sale within five years scientists claim they say it could also be used to stop the onset of diabetes reinvigorate patients and give them more stamina the drug is made up of chemicals that mimic resveratrol a compound which is found in the skins of red grapes previous research has shown resveratrol reduces the impact of a high fat diet doubles stamina and extends lifespan in mice however to get the same benefits a human would have to drink around 1 000 bottles of wine now a pharmaceutical firm has developed a pill based on two chemicals that act in the same way in one study on mice published last year the drug was found to reverse the symptoms of diabetes it was also shown to cut sensitivity to insulin the chemical that helps control blood sugar levels in the body and which is in short supply in diabetes sufferers the first clinical trials on humans are now under way and the developers sirtris pharmaceuticals believe it could also help prevent diseases including cancer heart disease and one of the drawbacks of resveratrol is that the doses need to be large now this paper says you can reduce it into a little pill taken once a day the chances of success in humans is estimated at 80 to 90 per cent his researchers tested around 500 000 molecules to find those that would have the same effect as resveratrol on genes known to control the ageing process

2520636 debkafiles geopolitical experts note that on the surface level the russians are backing the separatists of s ossetia and neighboring abkhazia as payback for the strengthening of american influence in tiny georgia and its 4 5 million inhabitants however more immediately the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines saakashvili need only back away from this plan for moscow to ditch the two provinces revolt against tbilisi as long as he sticks to his guns south ossetia and abkhazia will wage separatist wars

2520663 its so tight in the field that if you get caught in a wind hole for 30 seconds 20 boats pass you
2520664 the wind shut down and i was passed by nine or 10 boats

2520672 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2520673 i think they need to work through that process of healing

2520689 but just as it likely was poisoning from lead in the environment that brought the condor to the brink of extinction 20 years ago it is certainly lead that today stands in the way of the condor surviving in nature without substantial support from humans
2520690 its important that this priority effort operate at a higher level with the u s fish and wildlife service

2520692 the california condor is in many ways the states signature bird for conservation
2520693 now that weve moved beyond our original goal which was simply to keep the bird from disappearing we want to make sure that were doing whats necessary to get the bird thriving in the wild without human assistance
2520694 there are those who stay at home and those who go away and it has always been so everyone can choose for himself but he must choose while there is still time and never change his mind
2520695 im not particularly surprised i do think some of the charges as i annunciated in court basically like the kidnap for ransom im not sure was there

2520704 im telling you it flies in the face of teachers that walk into classrooms every day and have spent a lot of time and energy in higher education and this bill basically says you can get online and take a couple of tests pay this group 500 and you can walk into a classroom after about ten days working with children
2520705 our better energy would have been spent figuring out ways to pay teachers more so that we can attract the best teachers to our classrooms
2520706 perhaps it can be said that seismic changes are taking place in malaysia because there has been no political renewal and special interest groups are entrenched perhaps the race based system which both lee and anwar challenged under which this group preserves its interests is no longer tenable in the age of the internet perhaps too many malays who support anwar now realise that malaysian malaysia or reformasi is what the country needs to lift the masses out of poverty not an astronaut or istanas if so then perhaps lee was right after all
2520707 that the seeds of malaysian malaysia planted four decades ago and dormant so long have suddenly taken root and germinated as reformasi
2520708 as the datuk seri anwar ibrahim saga unfolds before our eyes reflecting a similar episode 10 years ago it is strange that singaporeans do not experience a sense of deja vu not of the first episode but of aug 9 1965 while the absence of deja vu may be attributed to the passage of time of more than 40 years anyone who reads minister mentor lee kuan yews memoir a bestseller in singapore cannot fail to notice the parallels between lees battle against umno and anwars challenge against the same juggernaut

2520711 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007
2520712 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2520713 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time

2520719 the looms of crime hidden in the dark recesses of mortal thought
2520720 when mortal man blends his thoughts of existence with the spiritual and works only as god works he will no longer grope in the dark and cling to earth because he has not tasted heaven carnal beliefs defraud us they make man an involuntary hypocrite producing evil when he would create good forming deformity when he would outline grace and beauty injuring those whom he would bless he becomes a general mis creator who believes he is a semi god
2520721 the inaudible voice of truth is to the human mind as when a lion roareth
2520722 error carnal beliefs self destruct having no power to determine who we are what we lack or the burden we carry it dissolves into its native nothingness
2520723 though the way is dark in mortal sense divine life and love illumine it destroy the unrest of mortal thought the fear of death and the supposed reality of error christian science contradicting sense maketh the valley to bud and blossom as the rose
2520724 in science man is the offspring of spirit the beautiful good and pure constitute his ancestry his origin is not like that of mortals in brute instinct nor does he pass through material conditions prior to reaching intelligence spirit is his primitive and ultimate source of being god is his father and life is the law of his being

2520753 yo no s contra qui n van a luchar esos portaviones aqu no hay enemigos contra ellos
2520754 como militar yo no tendr a por qu preocuparme ahora si yo ataco a estados unidos lo confronto y lo declaro enemigo podr a pensarse de otra manera en la nueva doctrina militar bolivariana el enemigo declarado de la revoluci n es los eeuu
2520755 que sea una provocaci n pudiera ser un toque de alerta
2520756 algo debe estar viendo los eeuu que llev a reactivar esta flota est el tema de la guerrilla los v nculos entre el gobierno de venezuela y otros gobiernos con las farc o el tema de las relaciones con ir n
2520757 no es una amenaza militar pero si es un esquema disuasivo
2520758 la disuasi n puede significar simplemente una exhibici n de fuerza un mensaje que quiera darse
2520759 hay un mensaje de contenido geopol tico en el marco de un reordenamiento en el hemisferio americano

2520767 se tome m s en serio que nunca la posibilidad de un eventual ataque de estados unidos
2520768 one of the main steps under consideration is a redeployment of nuclear missiles to kaliningrad and belarus
2520769 these missiles would be pointed at europe it would be a perfectly legitimate step if america wants to expand its military capabilities in europe then we have the right to act accordingly
2520770 how would washington feel if we placed interceptor missiles on cuba or venezuela
2520771 we take the possibility of missiles being redeployed against europe very seriously and are aware of the discussions about kaliningrad
2520772 but we also think there is some bluff involved the kremlin is banking on one thing that the shield wont see the light of day before president george w bush leaves the white house next year and it could be scrapped after that
2520773 britain and russia are in the middle of an intelligence battle
2520774 new president or not it will take a long time to repair relations more cold war spy scandals are very likely

2520779 shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere who now know that there are no limits to their dreams
2520780 let us resolve and work toward achieving a very simple proposition there are no acceptable limits and there are no acceptable prejudices in the 21st century in our country

2520786 la capacidad de la rep blica isl mica de ir n es tal que si ee uu dispara un misil ir n ser a capaz de destruir con sus misiles israel y las bases de ee uu en la regi n antes de que se posase el polvo del misil americano
2520787 omnipotent spirit another name for god shares not its strength with matter or with human will
2520788 in the short run that they the middle eastern swfs are investing here is good
2520789 but in the long run it is unsustainable our power and authority is eroding because of the amounts we are sending abroad for energy
2520790 america has hardly even begun to repay its debt to iraq
2520791 this is an immoral request because we didnt ask them to come to iraq and before they came in 2003 we didnt have all these needs
2520792 its totally unacceptable to me that we are spending tens of billions of dollars on rebuilding iraq while they are putting tens of billions of dollars in banks around the world from oil revenues
2520793 us policy must recognize that american security is threatened less by russias strength than by its weakness and incoherence
2520794 it was a remarkable rejection of american policy in an alliance normally dominated by washington
2520795 and it sent a confusing signal to russia one that some countries considered close to appeasement of moscow
2520796 the attitude toward russia in the world is different now
2520797 we are not being lectured like schoolchildren we are respected and we are deferred to russia has reclaimed its proper place in the world community russia has become a different country stronger and more prosperous
2520798 putin is a straightforward pretty tough character when it comes to his interests well so am i and weve had some head butts diplomatic head butts and yet in spite of that our differences of opinion we still have got a cordial enough relationship to be able to deal with common threats and opportunities
2520799 weve got common interests and from that basis we will seize the moment to make a difference in the world
2520800 amber means get on with your preparations stand by for immediate attack and tell us when youre ready
2520801 this administration will not attack iran this has already been decided but the president is really preoccupied with the nuclear threat against israel and i know he doesnt believe that anything but force will deter iran
2520802 if there is no solid plan the amber will never turn to green
2520803 the uniform people are opposed to the attack plans mainly because they think it will endanger our soldiers in iraq and afghanistan
2520804 our hands are always on the trigger and our missiles are ready for launch
2520805 evidence that the missile threat is not an imaginary one
2520806 i dont subscribe to the view that iran is in a position to inflict devastating damage on anyone
2520807 their equipment is quite inaccurate if not outright inoperable those missile launches were more like putting up a beware of the dog sign they want everyone to think that if you mess with them you will get bitten
2520808 his ahmadinejads failed policies have made iran more vulnerable to sanctions and people close to the mullahs have decided hes a liability
2520809 in three months time it will be a different middle east
2520810 no one here is talking about more than delaying the nuclear programme
2520811 maybe the israelis could start off the attack and have us finish it off
2520812 and maybe that has been their intention all along but in terms of the long term military campaign that would be needed to permanently suppress irans nuclear programme only the us is perceived as having that capability right now
2520813 tiene que elegir entre la cooperaci n o la confrontaci n
2520814 esperamos m s amenazas y m s hostilidad de los enemigos pero la fuerza de ir n crece d a a d a y vamos hacia delante
2520815 so lets be friends guys lets be frank and open
2520816 would be taken in russia as a direct threat to the security of our country
2520817 weve heard promises previously on the subject of expansion but for us theres no clarity about natos future intentions

2520820 there is no need for the western countries to be worried or concerned or make any irresponsible accusations we have a vast territorial sea it is the sacred duty of the chinese army to safeguard our security on sea
2520821 though india is not worried about beijing building a strategic naval base on hainan island in the south china sea it is concerned about the numbers nuclear submarines have long legs traversing anywhere between 7 000 15 000 kilometers it is immaterial where they are based

2520848 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2520849 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2520850 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2520851 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2520852 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2520853 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2520854 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2520855 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2520856 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2520857 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2520858 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2520867 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2520868 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2520869 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2520870 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

2520872 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2520873 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2520874 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2520875 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2520876 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2520877 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones

2520879 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2520880 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2520881 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2520882 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2520883 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2520884 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2520885 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2520886 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2520887 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2520888 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2520889 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2520891 results continue to show improvement and we are performing essentially in line with our revised business plan budget legal and professional fees continue to have a negative impact on operating results with such costs aggregating 330 thousand during the recent quarter
2520892 i am pleased that our total average cost of funds is continuing to decline to 4 25 for the 2nd quarter 2008 it is down from 4 82 during the 2nd quarter 2007 we will continue to reduce these costs by attracting core deposit accounts through our enhanced calling programs remote deposit capture program and compensating balances from commercial loan customers
2520893 asset quality remains manageable with non performing loans aggregating 4 3 million at june 30 2008 which represents an approximate 700 thousand increase from the 3 6 million in nonperforming loans at year end 2007 the underlying collateral real estate of one loan previously included in the non performing category has been transferred to other real estate owned as a result of foreclosure in june 2008 in the amount of 2 4 million a july 2008 appraisal shows a 2 9 million value substantially all of the 4 3 million in non performing loans is real estate secured with current appraisals none performed beyond one year which all exceed the book or carrying values as further comfort
2520894 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2520895 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2520896 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2520897 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2520898 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2520899 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2520900 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour

2520906 i said oh thats right the city owns the sidewalks
2520907 somebody hinted to the department of transportation that the city might get negative publicity
2520908 shes definitely low culture but theres nothing obscene about it and in a way it acknowledges times squares seedy past i heard that janette had to go to bloomberg just to make sure it was o k
2520909 i dont think people are going to switch over to bikes because its good for them or because its politically correct theyre going to do it because it gets them from a to b faster
2520910 it feels good if the weathers o k and if you see something that interests you you just stop
2520911 the new york city department of transportation is not necessarily known for its cool reputation
2520912 now its cool in different ways for some people its cool if you have an old junker for other people its cool if you have a racing bike
2520913 anyway it doesnt immediately relegate you to nerd status anymore

2520952 the tests were very useful for working on some modifications to the car after the results in barcelona it was a positive three days session and i have progressed a lot with the car we have done more laps than in barcelona and this is very positive overall i am pleased with the development
2520953 everyday we try to better develop the car to be at the top of our form for the first race in donington at the end of the month i think we are on the right path with the correct options i am eager to get to the race week end
2520954 this second session was very important in barcelona we only covered very few laps compared to this session we needed to get familiar with the car now we are only a few days away from the first race would need more time to get to the very top level in terms results
2520955 i am happy with the work of the team and the engineers i worked previously with gabriele tredozi in f1 and this of course helps during the hard moments and crucial last minute choices because we have already acquired from the past a comprehensive working routine together it is clear that with a new car the work and areas for improvement areas never end in any case we have acquired good information to prepare a good race strategy in donington i am eager to get to that weekend
2520956 even i did not drive the car a lot i have a good feeling now with the car
2520957 the team is doing a good job step after step we build the future of the season and we have set the right directions for the progressing with the car progress direction

2520979 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2520980 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2520981 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2520982 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2520983 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2520984 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2520985 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2520986 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2520994 it could be true that donations were made but as a part of a deliberate set up to make obama look bad aaron klein reports from the israel for wnd again obviously if an actual illegal donation was actually made it should be returned but it would be interesting to find out who really made it and why
2520995 by the way aaron klein is clearly an sic conservative anti obama reporter for the ultra right wing worldnetdaily
2520996 their imagination in suggesting wnd actually set up the palestinian donations to the obama campaign
2520997 thats a good one it was an elaborate sting operation by an independent news source not feeding at the obama media trough says daily kos talk about your twisted convoluted conspiracy tales maybe wnd was also behind the forged obama birth certificate published by daily kos

2521217 previously we worked as prosecutors and capacity building assistants to fight crime with the request by t he efcc and usaids and the united nations we have been asked to draft a law on civil forfeiture
2521218 the bill if passed will empower the agencies for fighting crime and make civil applications to high courts for forfeiture of assets acquired through criminal means
2521219 it is not a bill that will reverse the burden of proof the burden of proof will remain with the prosecuting authorities that is the efcc or any commission that would compliment what the commissions doing right now
2521220 a new agency should be set up to bring civil forfeiture claims it is important for a moment to dwell on the terminology realm that is the forfeiture of property the possessor of the property will not stand the risk of conviction
2521221 but the beauty of the law is that the state and individuals could bring civil cases against the suspects people must prove how they acquire their wealth it is very difficult to get criminal devising methods to cover his tracks when we have this law in place
2521222 the reality is that where there are challenges we would not reject them in their entirety another challenge will be in section 308 of the 1999 constitution that gives public office holders immunity from prosecution it seems to us from everything we have heard that section 308 will apply in the course of our work as the person in question may say that he is not in a position to stand trial
2521223 it wont help us if we are allowing criminals to continue to enjoy ill gotten wealth
2521224 the demotion was done by the psc in the performance of its constitutional duty and whatever is the aftermath of it should come from the commission the office of the igp did not in any way take part in the decision because the police have three different establishments charged with distinct responsibilities
2521225 i do not know the fate of ribadu now in the institute the police command sent him here paid the necessary fees and he is more than half way into the programme
2521226 for now ribadu remains a bona fide participant sponsored by the nigeria police if he has to be withdrawn it must be the responsibility of the organisation which sponsored him
2521227 the credibility image of nipss is a collective thing that must be treated with caution
2521228 the commission is mandated to recruit appoint promote and discipline police officers in discharging its duty the commission reversed all promotions done by the former igp mr sunday ehindero when the psc board was not in place because such promotions were irregular unconstitutional null and void by this the commission has completed its statutory duty it is left for the igp to take further step in recalling ribadu
2521229 malam nuhu ribadus non criminal offence for these atrocious and oppressive actions of the federal government against him is his ribadus honest character and the unprecedented arrest arraignment and trial of some powerful big men for corruption i want president umaru musa yaradua to realise that any government that punishes honesty sows the seeds of its inevitable destruction by corruption

2521240 we are rebuilding the library and needed to move the books while we did that
2521241 there was no better way to move them then toss them into the middle of the floor
2521242 how are you going to know where they belong when you are ready to put them back it will take forever the way youve done it
2521243 i know who you are if you try to publish that
2521244 what are you talking about none of these shelves is fully utilized look move some of these books from the bottom shelf to the one just above it so that that shelf is full then take the books from the top shelf in the next column and use them to fill in the empty space so that each shelf is full and then once you do that youll have an empty top shelf space
2521245 we cant do that because then how will we know where the books are
2521246 arent they on the computer didnt we bring you software and technology for that as long as they remain in order according to the cataloging system it doesnt matter what shelf they are on
2521247 we sent two people to amman specifically to learn for a week we trained you and everything you said you wanted it computerized and it is we spent a fortune in training and software it looked so good when we left and you were running it how can you not know how to use it now
2521248 one of the trained workers quit and the other had a baby and is on leave
2521249 this was a deficiency on your part really they needed at least a few months in america with a faculty supervisor
2521250 there is no electricity and i think we blanked out the cds by accident
2521251 cds have backups you must know that we arent sending people to the us for 9 months with a faculty member to learn a cataloging system and finally we bought you a generator why isnt it on right now
2521252 the generator you know how hot it is outside who has the energy to go flip it on
2521253 its less than two minutes walk its currently 39c 102f in here how is it easier to sit here like this than walk 200 god damned meters and turn a key that will bring you both computers and air conditioning
2521254 project is over no more money its been over for years fine forget the computer system what about the card catalogs we brought that as well as a backup
2521255 then we can see your car drive by and say there goes marthas stewart
2521256 i think theres possibly an element of the credit crunch making decisions later than they might have been in easier times

2521268 kungkungan para ulama dan penguasa serta kungkungan kelompok kelompok islam yang manhajnya telah berubah menjadi mengakomodasi penguasa yang dzolim atau kelompok kelompok islam yang lain yang telah merubah manhaj gerakannya yang awalnya berargumen mengedepankan sikap hati hati tetapi ternyata semakin berubah menjadi kepengecutan sehingga mereka lebih memilih berebut kursi dalam pemilu ketimbang tegak berdiri untuk berjihad
2521269 rakyat syria karena bumi syria bumi syam adalah bumi yang diberkati agar berjuang melakukan segala hal yang mereka bisa untuk menolong saudara mujahidin mereka di iraq
2521270 kepada mereka yang terhalang untuk menyertai jihad di tanah al quds agar mereka bersegera berangkat untuk bergabung dalam barisan mujahidin di negeri dua sungai

2521304 the following was recently posted on another forum that i like to read and comment on from time to time
2521305 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2521306 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2521307 we start by working with the monsters in our mind then we develop the wisdom and compassion to communicate sanely with the threats and fears of our daily life
2521308 just because this is happening to someone else doesnt make me feel any better
2521309 how can i use this situation emotion to make me more kind gentle how can i use it to wake up how can i use this poison as medicine where is the opportunity
2521310 we can regard ourselves as already awake we can regard our world as already sacred
2521311 the elemental struggle is with our feeling of being wrong with our guilt and shame at what we are the point is that we can dissolve the sense of dualism between us and them between this and that between here and there by moving toward what we find difficult and wish to push away

2521350 you dont play arsenal each day it is a tricky draw we already said that but in football anything can happen we must prepare ourselves well and work like crazy for each other on the field
2521351 we must go into the match relaxed and with the belief that we can win there is no pressure for us
2521352 in england everyone thinks arsenal will have an easy job we must have the belief but the players must also enjoy these games
2521353 confidence is high because we have great players and it is important for us to carry on winning every match and win more trophies
2521354 we have all the conditions here at this club that we need to improve and win trophies for the club which is important both for the club and ourselves because everyone feels better when we win
2521355 there are contacts with some english teams im even interested in a role as benchwarmer when a big team comes up
2521356 togetherness can go a long way in getting you a good result against the top teams we senegal werent the best team but we did have a great team spirit and when you have that you can beat teams that have better players or are sides that are better than you
2521357 more than anything you have to want it i hate to lose a football game
2521358 i have been here a few weeks now everyone is working hard to get on with each other on and off the pitch and i think that is important to the club

2521365 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2521366 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2521367 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2521368 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone

2521403 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2521404 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2521405 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis

2521429 then i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth

2521491 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2521492 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
2521493 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing

2521502 its not easy to make the infamous willie horton ad from the 1988 presidential campaign seem benign but suggesting that barack obama is the antichrist might just do it
2521503 the ad was the creation of fred davis one of mccains top media gurus as well as a close friend of former christian coalition head ralph reed and the nephew of conservative oklahoma senator james inhofe
2521504 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2521505 the visual images in the ad which davis says has been viewed even more than the mccains
2521506 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2521507 mccain has a lifetime of experience obama has a speech he made in 2002
2521508 lets construe obamas rhetoric as indicating that obama is the messiah
2521509 you seem to think making fun of obama and co s continual recourse to messianic imagery and themes constitutes making fun of christ or the faith
2521510 i think its fine that obama and co exploit christian imagery constantly for political gain but i think its blasphemous when somebody points that out and laughs at it
2521511 im the messenger of god yes literally thats what i think
2521512 wow politician a thinks hes a messenger from god thats kind of amazing who does he think he is jesus mohammed buddha
2521513 i cant believe it politician b not a but b is referring to religion in the process of mocking somebody thats using religion for mockery how horrible of politician b not to respect religion
2521514 are you kidding y criticize politician b if you want but what politician a said is what started this whole thing and is worse by any objective measure
2521515 anyone else picture obama entering washington dc on a donkey when they watch this one
2521516 light will shine down from somewhere notice the pause i bet he was going to say

2521522 i had kate winslet right up to the last week in pre production then she said she couldnt do the picture because she had worked continually and had spent no time with her child
2521523 i forgave her and understood that completely but i didnt know scarlett from a hole in the wall i thought she was too young she was only 19 years old at the time
2521524 but i was in a hole and had to get someone fairly quickly i knew scarlett was a great actress and a beauty but i didnt know if she was really what i had written i hired her and became totally captivated by her
2521525 i would always call her as i did with diane and mia for years mia was a wonderful actress and she never let me down the same would be true with scarlett

2521543 li abbiamo trovati abbracciati forse nel tentativo di salvarsi a vicenda invece sono rimasti intrappolati dentro quella camera della morte e probabile che uno di loro si sia sentito male che gli altri abbiano cercato di aiutarlo prima di rimanere a loro volta intossicati dalle esalazioni

2521575 one of my staff brought your fine blog to my attention i thank you for your kind words and interest in my studies it appears that you have integrated them successfully profitably into your trading regimen
2521576 ive had more time to digest your site and it is even better than at first glance
2521577 alchemy of trading is a bit different from those weve reviewed before although stephen vita posts plenty of breaking market news and related charts vita who has an mba and has been trading professionally for 15 years presents a stream of consciousness in his multiple daily posts also shares commentary on his own portfolio and trades a better tool for experienced investors who can blend this conversation in with their own studied experience
2521578 ten years ago professional stock trader stephen vita never one to hang around the office would go on bike rides around new york city carrying a book size box with an antenna sticking out and stock tickers flashing across a display screen
2521579 ive cancelled most of my other subscriptions to focus on what you offer at alchemy thanks for your work stephen

2521582 i dont want you to feel the joy of seeing it explode
2521583 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday life and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2521584 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2521585 dear readers this is a call for volunteers for my ongoing masters research project cheers november
2521586 i tended to ramble on when i get too enthused end up overemphasising some examples and the audience gets bored
2521587 i just think its a waste if we dont make some effort to preserve dialects they are a big part of chinese culture so to understand our own culture and roots and to promote it to other racial groups you have to bring in dialects
2521588 there was no common language so communication was a problem and there were also gangs people were divided because of language ideology
2521589 you can say it has been successful because dialects are a dying language in singapore
2521590 but with the creation of a common language dialects are no longer a threat
2521591 a lot of youths nowadays might not even know what dialect groups they are from i dont see a danger of baggage from the past reappearing
2521592 i think it is a sensitive issue because on one hand you want students to keep their roots but you dont want to overplay dialects because in our history it has become an issue when people become over assertive about their own identity
2521593 culturally i see its importance but in the overall scheme of things is it useful
2521594 i would leave it the student if a student wants to take then he should not be denied the opportunity
2521595 i personally see no conflict in teaching dialects and chinese it could even enliven their interest in mandarin
2521596 it helps the younger generation and the educated communicate with the older generation and the less educated among peers it is a natural bond

2521603 then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him

2521606 then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me

2521615 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2521616 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2521617 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2521618 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2521740 the implication is that we have citizens in this city living on a street that is unsafe and i resent that
2521741 people who live there park in and out of their driveways every day and its not an issue for them

2521779 quando gli imprenditori europei sono arrivati in nuova zelanda si sono limitati a tagliare ogni albero di cui fosse possibile rivendere il legno fin quasi a deforestarla completamente nel caso delle isole del capo verde al largo delle coste africane questo processo di deforestazione stato spinto fino al suo limite a causa della attivit di estrazione e di fusione dei metalli che sono state portate avanti in quei luoghi dagli imprenditori europei per circa un secolo ora queste isole sono dei veri deserti esposti alle sabbie del sahara che arrivano fino ad esse trasportate dal vento e sono inquinate dai metalli pesanti lasciati dietro di s dalle attivit minerarie limprenditore si impadronisce con ogni mezzo delle risorse che appartengono alla comunit e lascia dietro di s un cumulo di scorie pericolose dovremmo ricordarci della lezione di rapa nui
2521780 la vera forza motrice dello sviluppo come noi lo conosciamo stata la manodopera di milioni di lavoratori che sono stati sfruttati per generazioni nellabisso delle miniere nellinferno infuocato delle industrie siderurgiche e che vengono sfruttati ora in quei luoghi di mercificazione della dignit personale che sono i call center ed i laboratori di maglieria

2521829 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2521830 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2521831 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2521832 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2521833 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2521834 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2521835 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2521836 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle

2521845 mpaa the owners of torrentspy accused the mpaa of violating the federal wiretap act by intercepting e mails
2521846 hacked into the company email server and configured it to copy and forward all incoming and outgoing email to his personal account and then sold the information to the mpaa
2521847 the district courts holding is contrary to the plain language of the statute misapplies the law of this circuit and by setting a precedent for the government and others to engage in similar conduct without regard to the wiretap acts prohibitions dangerously undermines the statutory and constitutional privacy rights of every internet user
2521848 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
2521849 this case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case the district courts holding would remove a vast amount of communications from the protection of the wiretap act as such those communications would at best be protected by the sca stored communications access act which provides significantly less protection against government access to communications most worrisome is that under the district courts holding law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of emails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
2521850 the second case concerns a request by the department of justice doj to a federal magistrate judge in pennsylvania for authorization to obtain cell phone location tracking information from a mobile phone provider without probable cause the magistrate instead demanded that the doj obtain a search warrant based on probable cause and the doj appealed that decision to the federal district court in the western district of pennsylvania in an amicus brief filed thursday eff urged the district court to uphold the magistrates ruling and protect cell phone users location privacy

2521856 postponing or freezing the tax on homes worth over a million pounds probably wouldnt deter many buyers but for owners of an average priced home it could make a major difference to the overall cost

2521860 little did we know that would be the last time we would see aiden
2521861 i knew from past experience that it was a bomb because it was not just loud but it had an echo a vibration with it
2521862 i locked the garage and drove home and i could see a pall of smoke in the distance
2521863 it was a horrific and chaotic scene there were hundreds of injured people some of them with life threatening injuries
2521864 i went there with my brother james and aiden was identified i then had to go home and tell my family that aiden would not be coming home
2521865 we just had to face that and it was a terrible thought
2521866 he was 26 at the time and he was married with two children it affected me badly then 14 years later aiden died in the omagh bomb
2521867 some people say lightning cant strike twice in the same place sadly i can tell them differently
2521868 he was a person that was at the centre of the house aiden was always doing things or asking others to do things
2521869 he was not interested in politics or bigotry or any of these horrible things his friends were right across the board
2521870 i think we have been denied a wonderful son and we will always miss him
2521871 that loss will become more acute when we get older because even if he was only there to make us a cup of tea or clean the windows he would be doing it for the love of us
2521872 that on a very simple basis is what we have been denied
2521873 the moment came which every mother and father must fear the moment when their beautiful children are lowered into the ground
2521874 the poignancy of that moment will remain forever with everyone who was there as the three coffins were laid to rest the loudspeakers picked up the wail a cry heard throughout ireland and the world
2521875 hair raising and frightening it was the lament for the innocent

2521882 for thirty years with only a minority in dissent the best most vital and compassionate minds of the left had hailed the flowering of the progressive state in soviet russia
2521883 even as the unmarked graves of stalins victims were re opened and their wounds bled afresh the new left raised its collective voice to proclaim the continuing truth of its humanitarian dream stalinism had died not socialism in the face of such epic criminality and collusion what was the urgency of our renewed dedication to the goals that had proved so destructive in the first place why were the voices of our enemies not more worthy of a hearing in the hour that seemed to vindicate them so completely why were we so eager to hurry past the lessons they urged on us in order to resume our combat again
2521884 for you and the prophets of the next left the socialist idea is still capable of an immaculate birth from the bloody conception of the socialist state

2521942 i think the review system might be a little bit of a comeback for the bowlers there will be more outs than not outs
2521943 everyone says the game is a batsmans game i think the review system might be a little bit of a comeback for the bowlers there will be more outs than not outs all the bowlers should be pretty happy that the review system is in place
2521944 weve had a number decisions turned around in our favour the other way of looking at it is sitting here and complaining about seven or eight wrong ones in fact we had those turned around i think its doing its job there are one or two areas that have to be cleaned up a little bit but from our point of view we are reasonably happy the way it has gone
2521945 it was a tough day of test cricket tomorrow will be the same
2521946 obviously well be looking at getting as many runs in front as we possibly can and then bowl them out again the track has got a little bit of turn but its not difficult if you apply yourself once you get in and you are confident and positive its not impossible to score runs
2521947 sanga held our innings together all day long we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did today the concentration he shows batting for long periods of time is what makes him world class he showed that out there today in difficult conditions for a quality player like that who is striking the ball well it wasnt too long before he scored runs
2521948 this is not the first time he has done it he not only took the shine and hardness off the ball for the rest of the players but also went onto make some handy runs as well he plays the quicks very well watches it very closely and is probably one of the best watchers of the ball in our team
2521949 a few decisions went here and there and we were really giving up
2521950 it could have gone either way from there we are definitely going to give more than 100
2521951 but when that stuff blew up thats where most of the energy for the storms went

2522011 in the end it held together but only just the 650 odd bishops who attended the once a decade lambeth conference went home with open schism between the liberal and conservative wings of the worldwide anglican communion averted a split may prove no more than postponed as the agreed mechanisms for making minds meet are oh so slowly put in place see article but at least the unedifying spectacle of comrades in christ tearing strips off each other over gay sex will vanish from the headlines for a bit does it matter if anglicans fall out most churches are riven by tensions it is not so long ago that the roman catholic opus dei glared at liberation theologists and moscows orthodox still squabble like mad with constantinoples but anglicans lack the glue that binds those churches together the power of the pope to impose discipline on straying catholics the body of undisputed theology that unites orthodox believers even when they quarrel anglicanism works through relationships a sense of belonging to a family with a shared inheritance that now has waned despite the apparent reprieve this years lambeth conference could well be the last of its kind as a secular newspaper that supports gay marriage and believes in a firm line between church and state we can hardly claim to be a neutral observer in this yet trying to look at the communion from an anglican perspective or that of most of them two things stand out first schism might not be a bad thing and disestablishment would be a very good thing

2522015 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2522016 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2522017 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2522018 such as a solar flare with the intensity as mentioned for 12 21 12
2522019 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2522020 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2522278 its out of line to insinuate that we should blacklist people for speaking their minds
2522279 its a strange thing when people in this country cant express their opinions without being attacked
2522280 its an important time for people on the conservative side to speak out
2522281 actually i welcome this kind of stupidity its the kind that pisses people off and those who may have been kinda cool to donating to mccain due to his somewhat liberal positions in times past may very well be angered enough by this brown shirting tactic to give

2522296 this tournament is not going to be won by 1 under par
2522297 its such a tough golf course that they dont need to trick it up
2522298 the fairways are running 30 to 40 yards the greens are like concrete its not enjoyable to play theyve taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap
2522299 if we had it like this once a year ok
2522300 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
2522301 nothing is ever going to get as tough as royal birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
2522302 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
2522303 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away
2522304 we are not used to seeing this kind of major at a pga championship

2522320 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2522321 the way i approached the game changed that day i just had one thing in my mind that i have to play for my country and live that dream for my dad
2522322 my first reaction was of absolute joy i could hardly believe it
2522323 a plus point was the chief selector was there i hadnt done as well as id wanted to in the indian premier league so i knew this tournament was an important opportunity it was pressure to have the chairman watching me against tough opposition but once i started doing well i grew more confident about my batting
2522324 dilip sir asked me to keep doing what i do i knew he had been observing me for sometime now and i hope i can live up to his expectations
2522325 he is a very physical type of player he likes to impose himself on the game backs it up with his skill
2522326 i cant be bogged down by a bowler i just like to give it back
2522327 i was asked to open the innings which i dont usually but i remained unbeaten on 120 and helped india win
2522328 he was disappointed that on a couple of occasions he didnt get as many runs as he should have simply because he had wanted to get a reasonable amount of runs a little bit too early therefore we agreed he should be looking to bat into the 40th over
2522329 he just told me to recognise my strong areas during the game and go for the shots i felt confident of and could pull off
2522330 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon

2522349 im anxious to start competing but also excited about executing my final practices
2522350 im definitely more relaxed this olympics i know what to expect and im very confident in my training
2522351 it is less than i have ran before but i also didnt run many in 2004 before the games
2522352 ive been working hard in practice to make sure im ready even though ive raced sparingly
2522353 i ran very poorly in stockholm and london because i was just exhausted
2522354 my coach bobby kersee and i debated running the 200m in london because i was feeling fatigued so when i came off the curve and realized i couldnt shift to another gear i just cruised in as to prevent injury
2522355 i made the decision to skip the 100m the next day and go home to get some much needed rest and sharpness back
2522356 im just working on specific areas in my race now im emphasizing my start and working on my curve running along with keeping up my endurance
2522357 i handle the expectations by focusing on myself and my inner circle
2522358 i never take my concentration off my goals and what i need to do to accomplish them
2522359 is a reflection of the extraordinary pressures at work in the housing and mortgage markets

2522372 up until about a year and a half ago i handled my career all by myself
2522373 i dont mind doing the hard work at first it was pretty easy because when i was working with
2522374 usually i am a pretty good judge of character and can weed out the people who will flake but there were a few situations where people were giving me the runaround i decided to start working with derek and hes been great now instead of putting my energy toward weeding out people i can focus on work
2522375 they always told me dont depend on anyone else for anything
2522376 even before i could really have a job i had a job
2522377 the neighbors used to hate me because i was always going door to door selling something
2522378 in the beginning they wanted to put me on a stick and crucify me or something
2522379 they hated me but now it almost seems like a lot of people in the indian culture have embraced me
2522380 i was lucky too i called up vivid and asked for a meeting steve hirsch was kind enough to take a meeting with me himself he doesnt do that for everyone i guess he saw something in me and i was a vivid girl which is great because you just cant get any bigger than vivid
2522381 there are a lot of things still planned for 2008
2522382 i dont want to talk about too many of them just yet because i dont want to jinx them but there are still some big things to come
2522383 its not so good for sport or for gymnastics with judges making decisions not by result but according to some kind of game
2522384 im gonna get myself in a lot of trouble with his remarks
2522385 but its been like this forever it hasnt changed countries have certain friends and friends help friends i dont know what message was sent to the judges in between sessions but i think were a better team
2522386 if you dont have an athlete here you cannot have a judge here
2522387 i know i dont look it but im 26 your body starts to tell you
2522388 eleven months ago i was given this challenge that seemed impossible and today i was out there competing in the olympic games representing canada and being a part of an incredible team
2522389 this is something i worked for for 20 years of my life and for these 11 months i had to search for small victories every single day you dont get that by winning a gold medal and i know that its not the final moment that defines the person its everything you have to go through to get there and for me the past 11 months especially have been so rich and taught me so much about myself and about the strength that i had and it felt phenomenal
2522390 its black and blue i told him dont be disappointed you contributed in ways you dont even know you pushed me made me push myself made everyone push themselves
2522391 it was very gutsy of him to go there and put it all on the line
2522392 im very proud of brandon he showed a lot of strength of character
2522393 brandon probably ruptured his lateral ligament complex and as well he had tendons that are snapping back and forth
2522394 he was probably an 8 or 9 on every landing
2522395 have this opportunity taken away from him when he had the potential for a podium position hes devastated
2522396 especially brandon pushing super hard to do anything he could just to get out there it was amazing to see him it was just insane i have no idea how he was able to pull it together
2522397 the coup is a serious setback for mauritanians because it has robbed the people of their basic right to freely elect leaders of their own choice
2522398 we got guarantees that the parliament the democratic institutions the political parties and freedom will continue to exist
2522399 we will not release the deposed president at the time being for security reasons we are now trying to make calm prevail

2522403 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2522404 they dont want to be parents they want to be cool they want to be hip they dont want to be the bad guy
2522405 but guess what being the bad guy is your job
2522406 my mama knew better she wasnt there to make me like her she was there to shape me she was there to make me a good person

2522411 will answer the needs of individual service members as well as provide flexibility to the services and best value to the taxpayer
2522412 by definition the gate pays and separation pays are flexible
2522413 not from the standpoint of what we owe military people for an arduous career of service
2522414 what we are suggesting here is that there needs to be some parity between our older and our younger retirees
2522415 it is not fair to ask the oldest retirees who make the least to pay far more than younger retirees for a benefit that is just somewhat more generous

2522697 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
2522698 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
2522699 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2522700 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint the image could then be used with fingerprint recognition software to identify an individual
2522701 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2522702 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
2522703 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2522704 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits

2522714 note to self wear a different shirt for my next seo video interview i happened to wear the same polo shirt for both interviews
2522715 matt i often wonder how is the pagerank value stored internally is it a floating point number as many people suggest or is it just the integer value itself due to the heavy recursive pr computations
2522716 how many end users i e people with no vested interest in web design on any level fully comprehend what pagerank is and use it willingly
2522717 dave original i believe your intuition is way off on this one the last time i checked many many more users turned on the pagerank display than there are site owners the pagerank display is actually a popular feature as it turns out
2522718 i figured the seo industry could use something to discuss
2522719 my memory may not serve totally correctly on this and its after 2 am and i cant sleep but isnt the pagerank indicator visible by default after the install
2522720 from where do you know when a pr update is made
2522721 could you clarify what the low medium amp high page rank values in google webmaster tools are
2522722 at some point we take our internal pageranks put them on a 0 10 scale and export them so that theyre visible to google toolbar users
2522723 folks my blog is not the best place to chat about pagerank for an individual site going up or down the various forums around the web are probably better for that
2522724 my personal opinion is that the duplicate content filter should have an allowance of maybe 5 10 copies per website this is because if you write good content on an information site people will copy this means that all the hard work that you have applied to your website has gone done the drain so to speak i think is a problem that needs to be addressed i have an information website and everytime i write something on the site i always get at least 15 people copying my stuff

2522840 the world has entered a second nuclear age for the first time since the end of the cold war the threat of nuclear annihilation is on the rise should such an assault occur there is a strong likelihood that the trail of devastation will lead back to abdul qadeer khan the pakistani father of the islamic bomb and the mastermind behind a vast clandestine enterprise that has sold nuclear secrets to iran north korea and libya khans loose knit organization was and still may be a nuclear wal mart selling weapons blueprints parts and the expertise to assemble the works into a do it yourself bomb kit amazingly american authorities could have halted his operation but they chose instead to watch and wait khan proved that the international safeguards the world relied on no longer worked journalists douglas frantz and catherine collins tell this alarming tale of international intrigue through the eyes of the european and american officials who suspected khan tracked him and ultimately shut him down but only after the nuclear genie was long out of the bottle
2522841 thorough research and brisk prose propel a terrifying tale of greed weaponry and geopolitics
2522842 i think the lesson of his life and the large lesson here is that by looking for short term goals successive american administrations ignored the long term dangers of what a q khan was doing and that was to spread nuclear technology to very unstable places and possibly sell it to a terrorist group as yet unidentified
2522843 a q khan is to our way of thinking the most dangerous criminal in the history of the world because he stole technology he stole designs from a dutch lab in the he took that back to his home country of pakistan he helped them develop a nuclear arsenal there and then he turned around and reversed his own theft and began selling it to the highest bidders we know he sold it to three troublesome countries iran libya and north korea we believe that this book makes a compelling case that theres a fourth unidentified customer out there and in a sense thats the most terrifying aspect of this whole a q khan problem
2522844 what drove us is that we think this is the single most important issue facing the world today its not just an american issue its not just an iranian issue but its a global issue that requires global solutions and we use this book to try and use a q khans life to dramatize the problems of nuclear proliferation the dangers of nuclear proliferation and some of the solutions that are available to prevent a terrorist attack with a nuclear device or nuclear war between pakistan and india

2522852 nor on the contrary are they any less wide of the mark who think that religion consists in acts of worship alone and in the discharge of certain moral obligations and who imagine they can plunge themselves into earthly affairs in such a way as to imply that these are altogether divorced from the religious life this split between the faith which many profess and their daily lives deserves to be counted among the more serious errors of our age
2522853 to those to whom much is given much more will be required
2522854 this split between the faith which many profess and their daily lives deserves to be counted among the more serious errors of our age

2522856 you know i love timbaland he is like a brother to me but until the music is done its premature

2522858 i understand this music so well because youre from australia

2522860 the policy and legal positions as expressed in the appropriate documents of the national and state democratic party from which local city committees derive their authority along with the basic political principles that join together richmond democrats whether they voted for senator obama senator clinton indeed any of those on the presidential ballot this february are fundamentally inconsistent with the process used by the richmond city democratic committee in 2004 as regards awarding its
2522861 2004 election marked the first mayoral contest under the new system and the time frame for action was truncated once the local committee members decided to make an endorsement they probably didnt appreciate the full ramifications of their actions as you know and i know the candidates and staff accepted the rules and played to win back then there was no time to do anything else
2522862 while we cannot change the past we can all learn from it and indeed must in case this matter requires some formal submission from an interested democrat for it to be properly before the rcdc then i ask that you consider this electronic letter such a submission all the democrats in richmond look forward to the rcdc reviewing this most serious matter and taking the appropriate action required and expected for the modern democratic party

2522885 at the moment i as a cricketer feel left out with the whole worlds focus is on the beijing olympics
2522886 inclusion of cricket in the olympics would give cricket a whole new identity as the games is massive i guess the all icc full members can get direct entry to the main event and the other teams can come in through qualifiers
2522887 also the best cricketers in the world should be eligible to play and there should not be any age limit
2522888 it will be a decision welcomed by professional cricketers if it happens
2522889 besides who doesnt want to be part of an event so huge the twenty20 version is ideally suited to the olympics as it has mass pulling power and entertainment value
2522890 it doesnt take a lot of time and will be easier for the world audience to understand i am not in favour of allowing every country to participate the full members and three or four qualifiers would ensure quality
2522891 i would have absolutely messed up the matrix at that point i wasnt smart enough as an actor to let the movie be whereas keanu was
2522892 is a democratic stronghold and everybody wants to move forward
2522893 i have met with the unity campaign and were hopeful to coordinate our efforts with the unity campaign which is really a big umbrella for the party and also to coordinate our efforts with the state rep candidate joe moody campaign the u s sen candidate rick noriega campaign the others to see how we can help each other out
2522894 i watched that video and i think the press is trying to create some sort of soap opera
2522895 this goes back to sen obama as a community organizer the folks running the campaign they get it they know when president obama is governing hes going to need help
2522896 it is crucial in 2011 to have a seat at the table
2522897 depending who you talk to there are about 30 house races seats we need to hold on to and seats we might be able to pick up
2522898 i always tell people harris county is the swing state of texas all those races even at the county level will be important
2522899 we know sen clinton did a fantastic job and had incredible relationships
2522900 its about us and john mccain when we put those options out to folks particularly in mexican american latino parts of the state folks are smart theyll get it
2522901 a targeted effort in the straight ticket democratic areas from segundo barrio to socorro
2522902 there are issues and concern that democratic supporters be in unity and that hasnt happened it behooves el paso to not only carry obama but carry him at the percentage were capable of which should be 65 percent
2522903 two years ago the party did not unify for shapleigh we cant have that
2522904 if the obama campaign wants good support it has a responsibility to support the downticket and that starts at the top
2522905 this is just what i need its perfect how much is it i want to buy this

2522938 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2522939 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2522940 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2522941 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too

2522945 i kind of feel like there is a lot of pent up demand from buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines for the last three to four years this appears to be the first year where the reo market is leading the way and pushing prices lower buyers are coming out of the woodwork to pick up bargains yet i think by next year these buyers will have bought and demand will decrease as inventory from reos and regular motivated sellers continues to rise by the fall of next year you should see the higher priced areas come down more in line to where they should be

2522956 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2522957 this was obviously very very stressful for them and i dont pretend to tell you what it is they are thinking at this time
2522958 i have been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny for seven months during this time period
2522959 ive always been on time ive always listened to my attorneys in everything that we are doing i hear your honors rulings especially the one that was happening here the last time we were here
2522960 ive also been trying to be a good mayor at the same time even with incredible odds and incredible scrutiny
2522961 im hoping you will be able to have the mayor step down
2522962 i feel the mayor has not had the best interests of the city what happened thursday put the icing on the cake he cannot do any city business behind bars
2522963 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2522964 for me hanging over my head is that i want us to come home together
2522965 to do that we have to work hard and keep together

2522970 i knew it was lucky because of the never ending 8
2522971 they really wanted that date and they were lucky they called a year and a half in advance
2522972 i didnt realize it was a lucky date at first and then i got so many calls requesting it
2522973 we liked the 8 because it looks like the infinity symbol when you turn it on its side and were hoping it brings us good luck
2522974 i feel amazing happy relieved that everything went well and were just so happy it didnt rain
2522975 we were totally freaking out earlier and now i just cant wait to go to jamaica on my honeymoon

2522987 the only noise i heard was somebody getting hit by a golf ball and they were grunts
2522988 this tournament is not going to be won by 1 under par
2522989 its such a tough golf course that they dont need to trick it up
2522990 the fairways are running 30 to 40 yards the greens are like concrete its not enjoyable to play theyve taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap
2522991 if we had it like this once a year ok
2522992 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
2522993 nothing is ever going to get as tough as royal birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
2522994 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
2522995 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away

2523002 i really had no desire to be in politics prior to last year
2523003 nine years ago when i first began visiting congress with the academy of ophthalmology advocating and addressing health care issues i had a wonderful rapport and relationship with the honorable former congressman jim leach i thought leach was an ideal representative for our district he was very thoughtful he was introspective he was highly intelligent he would dissect bills and issues and then give you a response now he may not have always given the response that you wanted but at least you were assured that there was insight and a true understanding of the difficulties and different sides of an issue i always felt that he was doing what was best for the district and for the constituents within the boundaries of the constitution
2523004 i didnt have a sense that there was an understanding for the voters problems or a sense of knowledge of the issues the thing that i believe makes a good representative and provides thoughtful insight into regulations and laws
2523005 one of the very effective things about my candidacy is the fact that i am a small business owner that i am a woman that im a mother that im a wife of almost 25 years that im a veteran that i was a nurse and the fact that i left home at 16 and paid my own way through college all of these combination of things are so very different in and of themselves yet they make a complete package that is a microcosm of our entire society and our entire district
2523006 one is always cognizant of the fact of being a role model for those that will hopefully come behind
2523007 i try to always present myself as i am to be authentic and sincere im caring but also intelligent and knowledgable on the issues voters want someone who is credible and competent and capable and then if you have those additional attributes that women bring to the table thats icing on the cake
2523008 i believe there is a difference between men and woman although i also realize that there is crossover
2523009 i think women tend to be more receptive of other viewpoints women listen carefully build consensus and are good at collaborating they have knack for bringing different groups of people into the fold so to speak
2523010 i think that having the experience of working around men in a position of authority and being able to be respectful dignified and commanding but doing so in a manner that doesnt leave anyone feeling inadequate or less significant is important
2523011 so yes i think that my having been in the military when there were very few women starting medical school when there were very few women being the first woman faculty member at the university of iowa and being the first female president of the iowa medical society positions me well to work with different groups of people to collaborate well and to interact well and make everybody feel that they are a necessary component to the entire puzzle
2523012 que 77 kilowatios hora por a o kwh a o
2523013 well right now we have three line ups were going to look at i dont have a feel yet i havent been in the gym with sydney anderson and i havent been in the gym with some of our freshman so we have three potential line ups we are going to look at and see how it goes hopefully by the first week we will be evolving toward one of those it is kind of unfair to sydney anderson to have her master all that but thats how were going to approach it i really cant tell you what our best line up is right now
2523014 i was little indifferent whether it was 30 or 25 i think it will be great for the fans you have to have a little bit more mentality of you cant take points off and have to be low error you make three or four errors in a row and get down its a shorter distance to be able to come back i think it is going to make more competitive games and there will be a lot more close games i think youre going to see more four and five set matches the people that wanted that decision in the ncaa i think they are going to get what they want i worry that some of the matches the fans may not feel like they got much for their money because if there is a 3 0 match maybe it goes pretty short thats the downside of it the best analogy i can give you when youre watching the olympics you watch the 800 meter dash they have two or three minutes to finish it and the 100 meter dash you have ten seconds to decide who is going to win it
2523015 everybody in the country knows that jordan is going to get a lot of attempts jordan knows that youve got to have your role players and jordan is going to be that go to player but also you have to be a balanced team because teams will want to find ways to slow her down we have to be creative in where we give her those opportunities we have to move her around she is going to hit out of the front row and the back row she is going to have a lot of chances to win games
2523016 well that is what we have to find out during practice i dont know and thats what the next few weeks are going to be about i know several players have been challenged this spring and this summer to be able to step up
2523017 were still doing the same things were working hard building that team chemistry we do have five new players but fortunately with the bridge program they were able to get here four weeks ago so there has been a smoother transition but the biggest thing is not having a setter this spring that was the biggest unknown and the biggest anxiety for me until we can get in there and get going it felt like we went through the spring without a setter thats why i say we have three line ups we have to figure out how we can be really great thats the most unusual thing that i have ever had to go through since being at nebraska
2523018 first of all i think it is crazy that we are starting practice tomorrow saturday and two a days already it seems like summer has flown by everybody is taking summer classes and its been a lot of fun its great to have all the freshman here were really excited to get started
2523019 i probably have the most experience on the team but i also look to the other seniors as well because we came into together and were going to leave together id say its our team and i think everybody plays a part in that as well we have a lot of young players and they need to find themselves as well i think it is our team together and im going to try and lead the best i can
2523020 yeah its going to be fun they are going to bring a whole new attitude towards the game and its going to be a lot of fun seeing what the talent level is out there
2523021 i dont think were the underdog i think you have great programs and we have been a great program for a long time just because we lost four all americans doesnt mean were going to be bad
2523022 i think were all really excited for this new season to start we have been working since january and i know a lot of us have been thinking about it since december were just really excited to begin and start paving our new path for this season
2523023 im really excited to have a chance to step up right away its not going to be easy its definitely going to be a challenge we have five middle blockers returning to our team this year bringing my game everyday is going to be important and being challenged everyday and being able to challenge back is going to be something to keep in mind ive been looking forward to this day a lot and all i can do is work hard everyday
2523024 the first personal goal that i kind of had in mind since i found out that we have the final four in omaha is that us three seniors started in omaha and getting back to omaha has been one of my biggest personal goals and to figure out how i can help my team get there i have had many goals in the weight room and personally on the court i have some high standards for myself i love our team and i think were ready to grow and makes some great strides this season
2523025 i am extremely excited for practice tomorrow its the first time i will get to be on the court with six people or six members of the team i am really excited im actually more excited than i thought i would be
2523026 i think this year people dont know what to expect from us and i think thats exciting in itself we have a chance to go out there and be great and we have a chance to do a lot of things that some people may not think we can do
2523027 are accused of criminal association with the aim of international terrorism and two of them also of serious fraud to fund terrorism
2523028 confirm that islamic terrorism is deeply rooted in our territory and that we must keep our guard up against it
2523029 i think its bullshit because what we did was take a great game gears of war 1 for xbox 360 made it run at higher resolutions and added three new hours of really good gameplay and it got lower reviews i think thats bullshit and i dont understand it i cant figure out what it is

2523151 nama al hasyawiyyah digunakan kepada orang orang yang meriwayatkan hadis hadis sisipan yang sengaja dimasukkan oleh golongan al zanadiqah sebagai sabda nabi dan mereka menerimanya tanpa sebarang interpretasi semula dan mereka juga menggelarkan diri mereka ashab al hadith dan ahl al sunnah wa al jamaah
2523152 terdapat sebuah kumpulan ashab al hadith iaitu al hasyawiyyah dengan jelas mengisytiharkan kepercayaan mereka tentang tasybih iaitu allah seumpama makhluk nya sehinggakan mereka sanggup mengatakan bahawa pada suatu ketika kedua dua mata allah kesedihan lalu para malaikat datang menemui nya dan dia allah menangisi kesedihan kerana banjir nabi nuh a
2523153 sekiranya engkau membantuku dalam dakwah ini engkau akan menguasai seluruh najd
2523154 penduduk dariyyah pada masa itu dalam keadaan sangat menderita dan kepayahan mereka lalu berusaha untuk memenuhi kehidupan mereka aku lihat kesempitan hidup mereka pada kali pertama tetapi kemudian aku lihat al dariyyah selepas itu pada zaman saud penduduknya memiliki harta yang banyak dan senjata disaluti emas perak kuda yang baik para bangsawan pakaian mewah dan lain lain lagi daripada sumber sumber kekayaan sehinggakan lidah kelu untuk berkata kata dan gambaran secara terperinci tidak mampu dihuraikan
2523155 aku lihat tempat orang ramai pada hari itu di tempat dikenali al batin aku lihat kumpulan lelaki di satu pihak dan wanita di satu pihak lagi aku lihat emas perak senjata unta kuda pakaian mewah dan semua makanan tidak mungkin dapat digambarkan dan tempat itu pula sejauh mata memandang aku dengar hiruk pikuk suara suara penjual dan pembeli
2523156 mereka mengakui bahawa allah taala datang pada hari qiyamat sebagaimana kata nya
2523157 al fajr 89 23 dan sesungguhnya allah menghampiri makhluk nya menurut kehendak nya seperti yang disebutkan
2523158 orang yang berpegang kepada akidah bahawa nabi masih hidup walaupun sesudah mati seperti kehidupannya semasa baginda masih hidup
2523159 kesan dari itu kritikan kritikan telah timbul kerana puak wahabi berpegang kepada dalil tersebut dalam kalam mereka hingga dikatakan bahawa islam dari segi jawhar dan tabiatnya tidak mampu lagi berhadapan dengan perubahan menurut kehendak dan tuntutan zaman tidak dapat berjalan seiringan dengan keadaan kemajuan dan proses perubahan serta tidak lagi mempunyai kesatuan dalam perkembangan kemajuan zaman dan perubahan masa
2523160 abd al wahhab bapa kepada al syaikh muhammad adalah seorang yang salih dan merupakan seorang tokoh ahli ilmu begitulah juga dengan al syaikh sulayman
2523161 bapanya abd al wahhab saudaranya sulayman dan guru gurunya telah dapat mengesani tanda tanda penyelewengan agama ilhad dalam dirinya yang didasarkan kepada perkataan perbuatan dan tentangan muhammad terhadap banyak persoalan agama
2523162 orang yang paling kuat menentang al syaikh dalam persoalan ini adalah saudaranya al syaikh sulayman penulis kitab al sawaiq al ilahiyyah beliau tidak mengiktiraf saudaranya itu mencapai kedudukan berijtihad dan berkemampuan memahami al kitab dan al sunnah al syaikh sulayman berpendapat bahawa para imam yang lalu generasi demi generasi tidak pernah mengkafirkan ashab bidaah dalam hal ini tidak pernah timbul persoalan kufur sehingga timbulnya ketetapan mewajibkan mereka memisahkan diri daripadanya dan sehingga diharuskan pula memeranginya kerana alasan tersebut

2523164 ziarah nabi adalah sunat yang dituntut ulama bersepakat dalam hal ini dan sesiapa yang berpendapat bahawa ziarah itu adalah haram maka para ulama wajib mengutuknya dan menegahnya daripada mengeluarkan pendapat tersebut sekiranya dia enggan maka hendaklah dipenjarakan dan diperendah rendahkan kedudukannya sehingga umat manusia tidak mengikutinya lagi
2523165 kemunculan secara tiba tiba mazhab wahhabi dan sewaktu mereka memegang kekuasaan di makkah operasi pemusnahan secara besar besaran telah dilakukan oleh mereka dengan memusnahkan pertamanya apa sahaja yang ada di al mualla sebuah kawasan perkuburan quraisy yang terdiri daripada kubah kubah qubbah yang begitu banyak termasuklah kubah kubah sayyidina abd al muttalib datuk nabi s
2523166 demi usia hidupku sesungguhnya al baqi telah menerima nasib yang sangat malang kerana hati hati yang kecewa mengikut nafsu dan berperangai kebudak budakan maka berlakulah pencetus kepada segala kecelakaan apabila tiada lagi kedamaian bagi umat islam kepada allah diadukan hak nabi nya yang telah memberikan petunjuk dan syafaat
2523167 celakalah anak cucu yahudi dengan perbuatan jenayah yang mereka lakukan mereka tidak mendapat apa apa daripadanya dengan membongkarkan harim muhammad dan kaum kerabat baginda neraka wail untuk mereka dengan apa yang mereka tentang terhadap orang orang yang kuat al jabbar mereka musnahkan kubur orang orang salih dengan perasaan benci mereka hindarkanlah daripada mereka kerana sesungguhnya mereka membenci orang orang yang terpilih di sisi allah
2523168 apabila bidaah timbul dan orang orang yang terkemudian daripada umat ini melaknat orang orang yang terdahulu maka barang siapa yang memiliki keilmuan maka hendaklah menyampaikannya
2523169 apabila bidaah lahir maka orang alim hendaklah menzahirkan keilmuannya sekiranya dia tidak berbuat demikian cahaya keimanan nur al iman akan hilang

2523182 you can go to school and learn theory but once you get out and make it a profession and graduate from playing for a party in the summer to wanting to make this a career there arent many places to get information and this gives these people an opportunity to perform and interact with somebody who has been doing it for a while and sit down and talk with them

2523319 actually none of these books are appropriate for review on the name of the stupid blog with the stupid editor who is a jerk we dont do non fiction particularly self helpish stuff that caters to the oprah set we get hundreds of publicity packages and requests for reviews each week and can only properly respond to those who take the time to do two minutes research into the scope and politics of the site can you please remove us from your mailing list
2523320 dear he who shall not be named i in fact spent more than 2 minutes on the site and since you have discussion tags such as politics i thought that perhaps our name of political book we have book would be of some interest furthermore i would like to point out and quote from your own about section it is a space open to suggestion so please write us if you have an idea which is what i did a simple no would have sufficed if you found our titles to not be for your readership you will not be contacted by us in the future but in the interest of future hardworking individuals in my position i would suggest that you make more clear that you are only open to suggestions that fit within a constrained pre determined set of parameters as this will perhaps cut down on the immense number of pitches you receive wishing you the best me

2523351 larry charles theory is just keep going till they throw you out i guess he learned that on borat the crew would set up and at the last second when the cameras were already rolling i would show up so either theyd be seen on camera leaving the interview and lose face or theyd have to talk to me it was like and now heres bill you could usually see the troubled looks on their faces at the holy land theme park the pr woman freaked out and finally told us to leave she was definitely not a happy camper

2523402 il soggiorno estivo del papa a bressanone si legge nelle motivazioni costituisce uno stimolo importante per la comunit ecclesiastica locale ed implica linvito a confrontarsi attivamente con la dottrina della fede
2523403 sono stato molto soddisfatto ha detto il teologo riguardo alla risposta del papa perch egli ha fatto il collegamento tra creazione e redenzione dicendo che le cose non sono separabili poi soprattutto ho apprezzato anche il riferimento al dio creatore che sancisce limpossibilit per gli uomini di gestire o di sfruttare la terra a loro piacimento perch siamo responsabili davanti a lui siamo praticamente i mandatari che dobbiamo gestire e custodire la terra come dio vuole

2523423 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2523424 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2523425 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2523426 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir

2523432 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2523433 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2523434 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2523435 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social
2523436 el objetivo es sembrar para que crezca en el futuro un estado democr tico y desarrollado

2523457 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
2523458 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
2523459 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2523460 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint the image could then be used with fingerprint recognition software to identify an individual
2523461 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
2523462 there is nothing which is best literally for the whole people
2523463 very very much consumer beware because if anybody tells you that you can spray something on it the problem goes away just turn and walk away
2523464 because theres no way with any type of contaminant you can just spray something on and walk away
2523465 you have to protect your eyes your hands and your breathing zone thats how youre going to get a contaminate if you cut yourself or you rub your fingers its on your eyes or when you breathe

2523471 i dont think that it has worked when it was launched last year things looked good for a month or so with shaikh zayed road not witnessing heavy traffic but soon things came back to square one there can be two reasons behind this one is the number of cars in dubai has risen steeply or the people tired of facing very heavy traffic on the alternative roads are now ready to pay dh4 for each trip through the toll gates
2523472 the new garhoud bridge is really good and with the wide lanes and presence of salik the traffic is not much but the traffic mess up starts after one crosses the bridge towards sharjah and now with the toll coming on the other two roads the alternative roads will also see a heavy rush we should be ready to see a very bad traffic situation from next month
2523473 the study showed high traffic load on al maktoum bridge which caused traffic congestion on some internal roads in deira it also pointed to congestion at al barsha and al sofouh due to the traffic load caused by motorists crowding these areas to avoid passing the al barsha toll gate the study proved the necessity to launch a new phase of salik on the congested roads and the need to redistribute traffic on major roads and creek crossings especially after launching the new garhoud bridge
2523474 during the peak hours when maktoum bridge witnesses congestion the parallel roads and bridges like business bay crossing garhoud bridge and emirates road are occupied only up to 70 per cent of their respective capacities some motorists avoid passing through the al barsha toll gate by using internal roads which cause congestions at al barsha and al sofouh

2523498 this is a parish that does exactly what the holy father tells us to do celebrating the mass reverently in the old and new forms the bishop is determined to squash it and to destroy me because he doesnt want me moving to another parish and doing the same thing
2523499 the bishop believes your ministry to be divisive is uncertain that ordinary pastoral care of parishioners is taking place and does not have confidence that you will celebrate the ordinary form of the mass with a generous heart for the vast majority of parishioners who expect sunday and weekday masses to be in english and at an altar facing the people
2523500 a slur on my character an attack upon my priesthood and totally without foundation
2523501 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
2523502 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities the letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity paralyzing mans noblest impulses

2523505 but members of the u s antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there
2523506 it western intellectuals has made man the measure of all things on earth imperfect man who is never free of pride self interest envy vanity and dozens of other defects we are now paying for the mistakes which were not properly appraised at the beginning of the journey on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but we have lost the concept of a supreme complete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility

2523520 a law which sets a maximal time period which one might hold off prior even to filing a suit depending on the type of case or claim
2523521 the limitations based on the state usually range from 1 to 6 years except for in rhode island which utilizes 10 years for many drives of action
2523522 there are as well statutes of limitations to enforce a judgment ranging from either 5 to 25 years based on the state the select few states use favorite requirements prior to the lawlawsuit can constitute filed like the written warning to the dr within the claim of malpractice making the dem amp upon the state professional and so wait for the claim to be denied or ignored for a particular period of time number one demanding a retraction before filing a libel suit and other variations vermont protects its ski resorts by leaving just one season for filing the lawsuit for injuries suffered in the skiing accident as an exception to that states trio year statute of limitations for other personalized injuries
2523523 within virtually all situations the instance starts to run on the date of harm nevertheless a brobdingnagian exception to this general rule exists a exception protects plaintiffs in situations where they might not be caring for months or years that they use been harmed within such situations statutes of limitations may start out a clock ticking either on a date of discovery of the harm or even on the date on which the complainant should have discovered the harm
2523524 the members period inside service just cant become utilized to compute the instance restricts for even even even bringing any action or proceeding by or against a member whether in court or elsewhere
2523525 when the statute of limitations is running or even when its expired making any payment or sign language a promissory note can reset or restart depends on your state law the statute of limitations always check whenever a sol has expired before making a payment signing an agreement to make payments or even acknowledging the debt is valid

2523529 we were never informed or advised that an indictment was imminent of him
2523530 it had never been made clear to him nor to us that he was the suspect
2523531 theyve maintained that they are confident they have the correct person neither we nor the public have been presented with any hard direct evidence of the doctors involvement in these killings
2523532 its very difficult when you have no direct evidence that this man was involved in it to say that he was the only one that had access to this material
2523533 in that affidavit there are at least eight other people who the government had the same suspicions on or enough suspicions anyway to get either search warrants for either their laboratories or their homes or their vehicles and how those people were eliminated we just have no information about how they were eliminated
2523534 thomas hawk was forcibly removed from the san francisco moma by two security guards at the direction of the over zealous simon blint director of visitor relations how ironic is that why taking photos in the atrium sf moma policy on this their own web site specifically allows photography in the atrium hawk had also previously confirmed this personally with thea stein in the marketing and communications department of the museum didnt matter to simon blint who according to hawk went all aggressive and power trip happy even trying to eject his companion

2523543 people could relate to what he wrote no matter what their background was
2523544 you have to want to learn from each other some people dont want to do that but its their loss
2523545 if he was writing about something that was maybe above his head like a medical issue he would go to the library and check out books before he would write about it
2523546 he just loved to write and every chance he had he would send something to the newspaper

2523571 i dropped a present for the new baby i saw gordon but it was a purely social visit and just stayed for a cup of coffee i did not discuss any letter and it would have been inappropriate to do so
2523572 as it is to almost the entire party and the entire country that without an urgent change in the leadership of the party it becomes less likely that we will win that election
2523573 gordon ought as chancellor and as putative prime minister to have condemned it from the outset why didnt he
2523574 if someone had ever done this before it would be much easy for us to do now
2523575 for me and for my president and my government as a whole it is out of the question that we would even raise this issue with these countries
2523576 we will not it would be undiplomatic it would not be fair it would be showing lack of gratitude lack of statesmanship lack of maturity
2523577 those who planned ordered committed and are responsible for the most serious human rights violations have not been brought to account and in many cases have seen their military and civil careers flourish as a result of their activities respect for the rule of law and the organs of the state responsible for its administration a fundamental pillar of the democratic transition in indonesia and nation building in timor leste will always be extremely fragile in this context
2523578 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2523579 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2523580 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2523581 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2523585 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2523586 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2523587 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2523588 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2523589 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2523590 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2523591 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2523592 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2523593 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2523594 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2523595 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2523596 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2523597 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2523598 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2523599 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2523600 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2523601 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2523602 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2523603 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2523604 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2523605 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2523606 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2523607 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2523608 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2523609 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2523610 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2523611 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2523612 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2523613 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2523614 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2523615 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2523616 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2523617 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2523618 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2523619 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2523620 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2523621 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2523622 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2523623 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2523624 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2523625 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too
2523626 you should convince millions of chinese and indians who are willing to live an american way of life that they dont have to buy cars they dont need a fridge
2523627 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2523628 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2523629 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2523630 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2523631 the negotiators from the three parties are engaged in consultations as we speak to try and tie loose ends before president mbeki arrives
2523632 all i can say for now is that they are working hard and i suppose things will go well
2523633 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2523634 it is with this in mind that the on going dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean

2523645 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2523646 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

2523871 sejauh ini kita tetap berpegang kepada keputusan sebelumnya polda belum memperoleh semacam jaminan apakah laga persib masih dapat berlangsung kondusif atau tidak pasalnya ini menyangkut perilaku bobotoh kalaupun ada izin kemungkinan digelar tanpa penonton dan dilakukan di lingkungan ksatrian tni

2523887 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2523888 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2523889 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2523890 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2523891 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2523905 to slow the drift of japan away from the west and toward accomodation with china
2523906 to accept russia as the core state of orthodoxy and a major regional power with legitimate interests in the security of its southern borders
2523907 to maintain western technological and military superiority over other civilizations
2523908 and most important to recognize that western intervention in the affairs of other civilizations is probably the single most dangerous source of instability and potential global conflict in a multicivilizational world

2523940 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2523941 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2523942 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2523943 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2523944 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2523945 but i do support saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2523946 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2523947 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2523948 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2523949 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds

2523959 normally with four points we would hope to get out of the group
2523960 in the beginning of the first half we played pretty good and also in the last minutes
2523961 i did not expect us to be as dominant as we were
2523962 christine is smooth and smart about her positioning shes able to play in many positions
2523963 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2523964 for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2523965 i felt it was my duty to warn the press of the novels potential to provoke anger among some muslims

2523970 i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any kind of activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2523971 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2523972 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2523973 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2523974 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2523975 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2523976 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2523977 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2523978 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2523979 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2523980 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2523981 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2523982 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2523983 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social
2523984 pci le top 10 de vos actus pr f r es en juillet

2523986 i nostri punti di forza sono la tecnica individuale dei nostri calciatori che sono cresciuti insieme il carattere forte del nostro allenatore la nostra tifoseria e la seriet del presidente
2523987 wir haben schon lange gewusst dass die blase irgendwann platzt seit acht bis zehn jahren war hier kein haus mehr f r unter 100 000 dollar zu bekommen
2523988 kurz vor dem beginn der krise gab es kaum eine immobilie f r weniger als 500 000 600 000 oder 700 000 dollar
2523989 es ist hei heute und n chste woche f ngt die schule wieder an da haben die leute anderes zu tun
2523990 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2523991 certainly there are no winners here it was a difficult case for all the parties involved its a tragic loss of a relative because he hadnt really done anything wrong
2523992 in the daytime its ok its light and people are out
2523993 once it gets to be dark its a different story
2523994 with the m o modus operandi and the suspect descriptions were able to say theyre probably linked
2523995 theres no silver bullet when people are desperate they take desperate acts weve got to keep trying as diligently as we can weve got to solve this problem we can stop it
2523996 we want it to be safer we want to bring our customers back
2523997 any time youre in a restaurant and youre having dinner with your family and somebody comes in and robs it thats a serious situation and were taking it extremely seriously
2523998 said they would start shooting if the tellers did not open the doors
2523999 somebody is going to die if you dont open the door
2524000 el se or yakobashvili se equivoca se trata por lo visto de 400 aviones
2524001 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2524002 nuestros pacificadores y las unidades que les apoyan est n realizando en estos momentos una operaci n para imponer la paz a la parte georgiana tambi n son responsables de la protecci n de la poblaci n
2524003 las fuerzas armadas de abjasia han comenzado una operaci n para expulsar las tropas georgianas de la parte alta del desfiladero de kodori
2524004 proponemos el alto el fuego inmediato y el inicio de la retirada de tropas de la l nea de contacto
2524005 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2524006 esperamos el cese inmediato de las operaciones militares y que se reanude el di logo
2524007 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2524008 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2524009 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2524010 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2524011 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too
2524012 you should convince millions of chinese and indians who are willing to live an american way of life that they dont have to buy cars they dont need a fridge
2524013 we bocog promised free access except for a few websites that jeopardise our security and the healthy growth of our youth
2524014 thats an assessment made by the authorities of which sites are good and which are not good for our youth its like what any other country does
2524015 however the other day i was asked would i apologise and i said i would not apologise as the ioc do not run the internet in china
2524016 but there will be a review of what happened when we come to audit the games when they are over
2524017 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2524018 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2524019 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2524020 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2524021 the negotiators from the three parties are engaged in consultations as we speak to try and tie loose ends before president mbeki arrives
2524022 all i can say for now is that they are working hard and i suppose things will go well
2524023 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2524024 it is with this in mind that the on going dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean
2524025 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2524026 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2524027 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2524028 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2524029 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2524030 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2524031 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2524032 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2524033 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2524034 i heard all the hosts of the recent olympic games had failed to clinch the first gold so why should we be an exception to that rule
2524035 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2524036 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2524037 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2524038 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2524039 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time
2524040 tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them
2524041 the american people are worse off than they were eight years ago
2524042 senator mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back
2524043 go kill me a coon and ill teach you to sing
2524044 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2524045 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2524046 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2524047 einer meiner tr ume war unter 1 00 95 zu bleiben denn als ich zehn jahre alt war habe ich die em 1993 in sheffield gesehen und da fixierte einer der ber hmtesten ungarischen brustschwimmer mit 1 00 95 weltrekord das war mein ziel
2524048 ich habe ein gutes material erwischt nur ist der anzug beim start gerissen
2524049 den rekord habe ich mir vorgenommen das habe ich erreicht das ist die beste empfehlung ich bin da wo ich sein sollte
2524050 aber es hat bei brust mit der einteilung des rennens gehapert
2524051 science is getting trumped by politics and i want that fixed
2524052 my case is the worst case scenario where politics is blocking good science
2524053 an effort organized by multiple federal agencies and powerful industry groups with support of tens of millions of dollars in congressional earmarks
2524054 were a bunch of nerdy scientists how the hell do we know how to cover up and do conspiracies were boring
2524055 there really has not been adequate research about what this material is let alone the repercussions
2524056 folks were told that this stuff had been studied to death and lewis is concerned that theyre overstating what they knew about the material
2524057 if its misused if its overapplied if it doesnt meet quality criteria of course its going to be a problem
2524058 science takes little steps but if you add up all the little pieces in 1 500 articles in the last five years you have a safe argument
2524059 it doesnt take but a high school education in science to understand this stuff bacteria hides in hunks of gunk
2524060 they are a really christian family theres not one person who has ever met them who has a negative thing to say about them theyre a great family
2524061 they would leave little messages for the players the whole reason they were here is because their life is usa volleyball
2524062 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2524063 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2524064 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
2524065 archbishop orombi isnt the first person who has used this language of colonial relics about the canterbury relationship i think its a misunderstanding really it would be fair only if canterbury governed now i dont govern the communion
2524066 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges
2524067 recent campaign by an american biology professor against the catholic eucharist
2524068 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2524069 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2524070 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2524071 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2524072 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2524073 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2524074 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2524075 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2524076 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2524077 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2524078 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2524079 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2524080 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2524081 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social
2524082 el objetivo es sembrar para que crezca en el futuro un estado democr tico y desarrollado
2524083 eles t m de se concentrar mas muito dif cil
2524084 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2524085 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2524086 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2524087 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2524088 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2524089 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2524090 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2524091 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2524092 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2524093 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2524094 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2524095 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2524096 war is never a good thing no one wants it

2524098 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2524099 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2524100 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2524101 if i dont do what i just covenanted to do cut me in half like this animal
2524102 i am the lord who brought you out of ur of the chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it
2524103 sovereign lord how can i know that i will gain possession of it
2524104 bring me a heifer a goat and a ram each three years old along with a dove and a young pigeon
2524105 covenant is a bible word you may be aware of the covenant god made with noah with abraham with moses with david jesus you will remember established the new covenant in his blood for the forgiveness of sins the point of a covenant is commitment the very thing to which we have such an aversion but where would we be if god had not committed himself to blessing the world through the offspring of abraham where would we be if jesus had refused to commit himself to washing away the sins of the world where would we be when god made his covenant with moses he promised to deliver his people from the land of egypt from the house of bondage he promised to be their god to protect them to guide them to bless them there were also stipulations to the covenant what we today call the ten commandments these were to be the response of the people to the overwhelming grace and goodness of god their promise to live faithful obedient lives not as a way of earning gods pleasure but as a way of expressing gratitude for gods mercy the new covenant that jesus established in his blood demands no less he has written his law not on tablets of stone but on the fleshy tablets of our hearts we have seen the glory of god in the face of jesus christ calvarys sacrifice is gods binding commitment he has made covenant with us covenant demands commitment what is our response are we willing to offer up our lives of obedience in return

2524109 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2524110 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2524111 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2524112 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about

2524118 if the u k is worried we have far greater reason to be worried
2524119 the implications for india could be catastrophic even if the temperature were to rise by as much as two degrees celsius because our adaptive capacity is so low
2524120 unlike a developed country such as the u k which can mobilise adaptation strategies like building barriers against sea level rise india does not have the financial technological or institutional capacity to cope even with existing natural disasters let alone climate change which would trigger an increase in extreme weather events like droughts and floods
2524121 even though vast resources were made available for tsunami relief and rehabilitation not even one third of those who lost their homes have been rehabilitated and only a fraction of houses built for the victims have been occupied because they were either found to be architecturally inappropriate or sociologically incompatible
2524122 communities who depend on climate sensitive sectors such as dryland farming fisheries and forest resources will be worst affected
2524123 for instance parts of orissa and andhra pradesh could begin to see temperatures going up to 50 degrees and cities like bangalore will begin to experience temperatures of 40 degrees by the end of the century
2524124 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2524125 all of my family knows about this and just to be absolutely clear none of them are responsible for it i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it

2524127 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2524128 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2524129 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2524130 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2524131 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2524132 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2524133 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2524134 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2524135 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2524136 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2524137 in every life there is one particular event that is decisive for the entire person for his fate his convictions his passions
2524138 where had all that russian generosity gone it had been replaced by political consciousness
2524139 for not having seen it all nor remembered it all for not having divined all of it
2524140 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2524141 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2524142 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2524143 if you are an international organisation dependent on international visitors and guests eliminating your carbon footprint is going to be impossible its about tidying up the edges and not being profligate rather than eliminating it its about doing our best
2524144 the things that will have effect are the price of oil and whether people can come at all
2524145 where a flight is essential people should offset it and be very careful to buy offsets that are genuinely beneficial
2524146 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2524147 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2524148 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2524149 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2524150 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2524151 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2524152 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2524153 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2524154 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2524155 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2524156 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2524157 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2524158 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2524159 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2524160 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2524161 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2524162 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2524163 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2524164 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2524165 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2524166 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2524167 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2524168 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2524169 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2524170 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2524171 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2524172 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2524173 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2524174 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2524175 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2524176 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2524177 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2524178 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2524179 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2524180 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2524181 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2524182 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2524183 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2524184 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2524185 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2524186 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2524187 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2524188 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2524189 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2524190 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2524191 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2524192 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2524193 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2524194 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2524195 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2524196 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2524197 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2524198 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2524199 just so you all know we did set a record
2524200 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2524201 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2524202 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

2524206 let me make it clear to sass leaders they should not try to browbeat the kashmiri politicians as such idiotic actions could cause more harm to the people of jammu than any other region
2524207 i am sure even certain quarters in the police and other security agencies are aware of the presence of such non state subject trouble mongers in jammu
2524208 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2524209 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2524210 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2524211 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2524212 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2524213 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2524216 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2524217 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2524218 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2524219 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2524220 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2524221 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2524222 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2524223 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2524224 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2524225 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
2524226 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
2524227 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
2524228 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2524229 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2524230 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2524231 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2524232 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2524233 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2524234 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2524235 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2524236 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2524237 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2524238 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2524239 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2524240 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2524241 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2524242 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2524243 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2524244 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2524245 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2524246 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2524247 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2524248 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2524249 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2524250 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2524251 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2524252 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2524253 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2524254 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2524255 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2524256 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2524257 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2524258 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2524259 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2524260 deep sea temperatures warmed about 1 300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric co2
2524261 suggests the rise in greenhouse gas was likely a result of warming
2524262 the co increase lagged antarctic deglacial warming by 800 200 years and preceded the northern hemisphere deglaciation
2524263 the weight per unit of area of a column of air that reaches to the top of the atmosphere
2524264 shifts in rainfall patterns cloud cover and warming temperatures triggered a 6 percent increase in the amount of carbon stored in trees grass shrubs and flowers
2524265 global climate change has eased climatic constraints on plant life around the globe allowing vegetation to increase 6 percent
2524266 increased atmospheric co2 and climate change are the primary causes of the recent
2524267 when the atmosphere gets hazy like it did after the eruption of mt pinatubo in the philippines in june 1991 plants photosynthesize more efficiently thereby absorbing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
2524268 diversity increases as the planet warms and decreases as it cools

2524272 significantly changes the planets distance from the sun during its long year which lasts 248 earth years
2524273 in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees fahrenheit
2524274 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
2524275 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
2524276 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2524277 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2524278 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2524279 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2524280 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2524281 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2524282 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment
2524283 a study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution
2524284 global warming will be put on hold over the next decade because of natural climate variations
2524285 snow cover over north america and much of is greater than at any time since 1966
2524286 as a result of the cold la nina current in the pacific
2524287 the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past four or five years that could mean global warming has taken a breather
2524288 the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming
2524289 global warming and other environmental insults were threatening the planet with catastrophe
2524290 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action
2524291 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that
2524292 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2524293 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2524294 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis
2524295 often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported

2524298 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2524299 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2524300 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2524301 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2524302 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2524303 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2524304 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2524305 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2524306 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2524307 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2524308 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2524309 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2524310 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2524311 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2524312 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2524313 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2524314 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2524315 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2524316 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2524317 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2524318 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2524319 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2524320 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2524321 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2524322 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2524323 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2524324 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2524325 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2524326 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2524327 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2524328 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2524329 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2524330 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2524331 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2524332 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2524333 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2524334 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2524335 real results by the end of my first term in office
2524336 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2524337 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2524338 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2524339 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2524340 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2524341 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2524342 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2524343 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2524344 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2524345 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2524346 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2524347 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2524348 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2524349 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2524350 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2524351 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2524352 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2524353 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2524354 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2524355 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2524356 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2524357 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2524358 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2524359 esperamos el cese inmediato de las operaciones militares y que se reanude el di logo
2524360 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2524361 nuestros pacificadores y las unidades que les apoyan est n realizando en estos momentos una operaci n para imponer la paz a la parte georgiana tambi n son responsables de la protecci n de la poblaci n
2524362 las fuerzas armadas de abjasia han comenzado una operaci n para expulsar las tropas georgianas de la parte alta del desfiladero de kodori
2524363 proponemos el alto el fuego inmediato y el inicio de la retirada de tropas de la l nea de contacto
2524364 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2524365 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2524366 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2524367 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2524368 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2524369 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2524370 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2524371 a veces una piensa que las cosas van a ser f ciles y resulta que no lo son estamos jugando contra equipos muy buenos que llevan jugando juntos mucho tiempo

2524373 pasamos mal la pelota y las receptoras iban en una direcci n la pelota en otra
2524374 no podemos regalar tantas pelotas y ganar si jugamos as ante austrlia nos dan una paliza
2524375 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2524376 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2524377 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2524378 no me esperaba que la clasificaci n fuera tan r pida y tras ver las dos primeras carreras quer a ser el mejor ubicado en la prueba final

2524380 phelps es un monstruo pero yo estoy muy bien entrenado y con gran confianza
2524381 estoy satisfecha con ese tiempo porque s que para la final nadar mejor
2524382 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2524383 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2524384 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2524385 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2524386 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2524387 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2524388 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2524389 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2524390 el se or yakobashvili se equivoca se trata por lo visto de 400 aviones

2524392 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2524393 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2524394 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2524395 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2524396 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2524397 well i will call the carpet cleaner to come out you call michael my brother is a plumber and we will get this taken care of
2524398 as they were sanding they ran into more moisture they can not lay flooring on that until we are sure it is not a leak and then we can not do the hardwoods
2524399 hey it can not get much more chaotic than it already is so go ahead and lets just rip the band aid
2524400 god uses every circumstance to teach us your attitude can change your circumstances if you change the way you look at things the things you look at change and until you change your attitude your circumstances could potentially continue to throw you into walls

2524403 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2524404 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2524405 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2524406 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2524407 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2524408 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2524409 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2524410 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2524411 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2524412 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2524413 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2524414 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2524415 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2524416 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2524417 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2524418 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2524419 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2524420 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2524421 the approval of the cabinet is incongruous considering that parliament has recently approved amendment to sbi subsidiary banks act 1959 thereby providing for more autonomy to associate banks through appointment of seperate chairman for each bank
2524422 we are going to ask the left if they would support her even as she is accused of amassing wealth much beyond her known sources of income
2524423 we hope the samiti will not stick to its position and will help restore normalcy and peace in the state talks will have to continue through talks alone problems can be solved
2524424 our doors are open for talks we can meet anytime but there should be concrete proposals regarding restoration of land and removal of the governor
2524425 we cannot fight terror with laws like these we will form a law stricter than pota when we come to power
2524426 the upa governments actions and its intentions are a matter of suspect for the whole country
2524427 there were some terrorist attacks also while nda was in power but in those incidents the security forces were able to shoot down the terrorists due to high moral today even the forces are demoralised by the government

2524435 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part

2524437 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
2524438 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
2524439 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
2524440 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
2524441 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
2524442 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
2524443 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
2524444 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
2524445 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
2524446 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2524447 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2524448 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2524449 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2524450 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2524451 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2524452 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2524453 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget

2524459 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2524460 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2524461 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2524462 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2524463 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2524464 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2524465 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2524466 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2524467 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2524468 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2524469 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2524470 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2524471 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2524472 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2524473 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2524474 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2524475 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2524476 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2524477 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2524478 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use

2524480 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2524481 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up

2524498 if any of you lacks wisdom he should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to him but when he asks he must believe and not doubt because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind

2524612 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2524613 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2524614 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2524615 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2524616 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2524617 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2524618 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2524619 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2524620 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2524621 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2524622 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2524623 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social

2524627 the success of my comedy has been not being afraid to touch on subject matters or issues that everyone else is politically scared of
2524628 its a joke believe me im not trying to hurt anybody
2524629 now america tell me again why cant i whip that girl
2524630 when i saw her laughing i told her that i was going to be a comedian so shed never cry again
2524631 when i started in the clubs i had to work places where didnt nobody else want to work
2524632 i had to do clubs where street gangs were had to do motorcycle gangs gay balls and things of that nature
2524633 the people come to see you the person they fell in love with but when they see you on tv you become a whole other character another person and they become disappointed and i wasnt going to allow that to happen to me
2524634 i will forever consult mr aidoos for his advice to move the party forward because in unity lies strength since the constituency has the potential of retaining win the seat
2524635 because the few who are carrying the heavy load are becoming burnt out or worn out and that may be contributing to the poor attitudes shown by some health staff
2524636 the work we all do the nhis and the health policy 2007 2011 must all be underpinned by research
2524637 ghana must embrace and develop fully the home brewed well researched community based health planning and services
2524638 we need at least 6 250 of them or for a better service 12 500
2524639 the national accreditation board and the council of tertiary education must be proactive in this endeavour
2524640 behind this whatever it takes obstructionism is an ideological commitment to high energy prices the rulers of the democratic party want prices to keep rising
2524641 if it bears out that it is simply a geological cyclical issue or whatnot regardless of where we might wind up with regard to global warming i do commend for example folks like boone pickens who has indicated again regardless of what we find are the causes of global warming that we need to really start working towards developing alternative sources of energy over the long term some people as the former vice president has indicated believe this is an imperative because of global warming others like boone pickens take a more market driven approach that is that global warming seems to be occurring and we need to discover why and what the correlations are but even regardless of that we need to be developing alternative sources of energy over the long term over the short term and this is me talking not boone pickens we are and will continue to be petroleum based economy that is not going to change in the short term and we need to therefore do everything we can to develop sources of petroleum so that we have the energy we need in the short term so that in the long term we will be able to develop the alternative sources we need whether that is natural gas solar to some extent wind to some extent or perhaps something that has not even been invented yet
2524642 to develop a sustainable program that addresses key strategic issues in environment and renewable energy
2524643 the research really is about looking at those things that are available and doing a military assessment in the field to see how they stand up under pressure
2524644 what the local communities get out of this is access to advanced medical treatment
2524645 this is the most cost competitive way to go for this application
2524646 thin films can be flexible so they can be put on a canopy they are also very light and they are very rugged unlike glass or rigid modules they can take some damage and actually can even take a bullet hole they can take a licking and keep on ticking
2524647 our on the farm bio diesel facility will make us more sustainable as a farm we will use the crops to make fuel and then use the co products the cooked soybean or sunflower meal as a source of protein for the cattle nothing that we use to make the fuel will leave the farm that is stewardship

2524649 i am for drilling i am for solar i am for wind i am for nuclear i am for any source that can be used to reduce dependence on foreign oil spending
2524650 the principle is a sound one if we do not use as much natural gas in power plants we can use it in cars

2524656 i dont know much about her we never played so i just want to try to find my feet for my first match and try to perform the best i can
2524657 the president of the brazilian football confederation ricardo teixeira accepted the brazilian olympic committees request that the olympic team did not wear the official jersey because it would blemish brazils bid to host the 2016 olympics
2524658 the ioc determines that we shouldnt use any national identification in the jersey only the colors of the country and the olympic arcs
2524659 teixeira decided to accept the committees request to avoid any embarrassment or inconveniences to the citys bid for 2016
2524660 its a pain to play without the symbol on the shirt because it imposes respect were five times champions of the world and we carry that on our chest
2524661 but its a political matter and something which the players dont need to get involved in
2524662 at the olympics the home team always win more medals than previously its that home court advantage it works it really works
2524663 i remember in barcelona they spain won more medals than at any other games before
2524664 this is their time in the sun and theyre going to do it well we have total faith well be no more surprised at chinas performance than we will the u s australia or anyone you get that at the olympics
2524665 im not surprised ive said all along well see something here
2524666 when you get to a home olympics you want to give a bit extra in front of your home crowd and they give you the support
2524667 i think they were very very solid in the finals well see how it pans out tomorrow
2524668 teachers are also required to handle their pupils with great tact be good role models to them teach the pupils well to understand and learn better guide and counsel these children to enable them to attain higher heights
2524669 it is therefore incumbent upon parents to provide their children with the requisite teaching and learning materials pay their fees and other levies promptly to make going to school enjoyable
2524670 parents must attend pta meetings and visit their schools regularly to discuss their childrens progress

2524687 we have had to fight very hard to stop the school introducing charges for mapalim to use the building which would have resulted in a 100 per cent increase in fees
2524688 total fiction neither i or anyone associated with the school has made any proposal to charge mapalim for use of the building for the after school club i am frankly amazed at the email that they sent and am asking for an explanation
2524689 mapalim have been running a popular and useful service at simon marks for the last two years but sadly now have to move on
2524690 i am glad to say that the school is in the process of arranging a replacement service in time for next term

2524706 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2524707 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2524708 russia has launched a full scale military operation on air land and sea we have entered a totally new realm politically legally and diplomatically
2524709 no georgia i believe started a war in southern ossetia and we are responsible to keep the peace
2524710 we have been appreciative of the american efforts to pacify the hawks in tbilisi apparently these efforts have not succeeded quite a number of officials in washignton were really shocked when all this happened
2524711 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2524712 they mark dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives are being lost and others are in danger
2524713 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2524714 the war in ossetia instantly showed the idiocy of our state management
2524715 to do a creeping annexation of south ossetia and abkhazia and secondly to overthrow saakashvili who is a tremendous thorn in their side
2524716 we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2524717 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
2524718 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen

2524720 i spoke with amateur boxing association of the philippines president manny lopez whos now in beijing and he told me harry ta amor isnt jogging outdoors because of the smog
2524721 theyre tapering off right now with a relatively light workout load
2524722 now shes four years older more experienced and more prepared her raw courage has always been there i guess it runs in the family someone joked her grandfather was a siga siga in san beda during his college days toni is lot more confident today her maturity is evident shes more determined
2524723 she sparred with boys who pushed her to the limit shes focused and hungry to win she holds her ground against anybody
2524724 i was told there was no way the judges would score the fight for toni over the hometown favorite in athens
2524725 if toni won that match she wouldve come home with at least a silver but things are different now
2524726 it would be hypocritical to claim they dont feel the pressure but their confidence is intact they know what theyre up against theyve got what it takes to win
2524727 theyre not affected by the incentives one way or the other they know theyre fighting for our country with the entire pta organization their parents relatives and countrymen giving them all out support and praying for their success
2524728 after the olympics well compete in the southeast asian and asian games if he continues to do well tshom might still make it to the 2012 london olympics remember we brought don geisler out of retirement for the last asian games everything will depend on tshoms focus and determination
2524729 that will surely lessen the pressure on tshom and toni
2524730 its dreadful if no filipino will have won a medal before they compete but tshom and toni are ready for any eventuality
2524731 most ambitious olympics in history opens with most spectacular show
2524732 hindi totoo yan hindi naman kami magkaaway hindi rin naman kami magka close
2524733 this unique outreach caught our attention for bringing volunteers together for the purpose of helping to feed homeless and low income families in the boise area
2524734 we have seen many food outreaches but this one had a unique way of producing the food to be donated our hope is that others will see what an effective outreach the garden o feedin is to the boise community
2524735 hopefully it will inspire others to start a garden with their own church or think of other ways to reach out to people in need
2524736 week after week we were only able to give people canned goods beans and rice we thought we should be able to give them a healthier diet and teach them to garden so they could produce their own food
2524737 we are here for the community to supply fresh organic vegetables for people in need or for those who dont have a place to grow them
2524738 were trying to get more people interested in helping other people our goal is for folks to give of themselves instead of just coming to church and going home
2524739 we want people to know the garden is here and anybody can come participate and help out
2524740 the more people that know its here the more publicity it gets the easier it is to get donations and for people to find us and know if they need help we are here
2524741 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
2524742 the king will answer and say to them truly i say to you
2524743 hindi totoo yan hindi naman kami magkaaway hindi rin naman kami magka close
2524744 there are no easy answers but there are simple answers we must have the courage to do what we know is morally right
2524745 one of the sad signs of our times is that we have demonized those who produce subsidized those who refuse to produce and canonized those who complain
2524746 how to stop high speed police chases suicidal bridge jumpers and save money too

2524749 russia needs to remove its imperialist war machine from georgia the only reason why some parts of georgia want to seek independence is because russia put its citizens there
2524750 theyve made a very strong circumstantial case an extremely strong circumstantial case
2524751 its such a key piece of their argument and its based on inference we dont know which other labs had the strains with the mutations
2524752 there is a classic defense mechanism to raise reasonable doubt by presenting the jury with viable options as to how the crime was perpetrated
2524753 this case would have been a very very difficult case to prove
2524754 thousands of prosecutors in thousands of courthouses across this country every day prove cases beyond a reasonable doubt using circumstantial evidence
2524755 eliminated every possibility until they were left with one which is a tedious but very thorough way to do an investigation
2524756 if those questions are not resolved there will always be a residue of doubt that the perpetrator will still be at large and that an innocent man may have been accused
2524757 its very important to tie up these lingering loose ends and address the gaps
2524758 im waiting for it to be shown that the quantity and the quality of the powders in the anthrax letters could have been produced in those suites
2524759 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2524760 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2524761 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2524762 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2524763 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2524764 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games

2524766 muchos a os despu s frente al pelot n de fusilamiento el coronel aureliano buend a hab a de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llev a conocer el hielo macondo era entonces una aldea de 20 casas de barro y ca abrava construidas a la orilla de un r o de aguas di fanas que se precipitaban por un lecho de piedras pulidas blancas y enormes como huevos prehist ricos el mundo era tan reciente que muchas cosas carec an de nombre y para mencionarlas hab a que se alarlas con el dedo
2524767 es muy dif cil encontrar en mis novelas algo que no tenga un anclaje en la realidad
2524768 promovi treinta y dos guerras y las perdi todas tuvo diecisiete hijos varones de diecisietes mujeres distintas que fueron exterminados en una sola noche escap a catorce atentados a setenta y tres emboscadas y a un pelot n de fusilamiento
2524769 una noche en que no pod a dormir rsula sali a tomar agua al patio y vio a prudencio aguilar junto a la tinaja
2524770 pero en realidad la nica persona con la que l pod a tener contacto desde hac a mucho tiempo era prudencio aguilar prudencio iba dos veces al d a a conversar con l era prudencio aguilar quien lo limpiaba le daba de comer y le llevaba noticias
2524771 el mi rcoles de ceniza antes de que volvieran a dispararse en el litoral amaranta consigui que se pusieran ropas dominicales y la acompa ara a la iglesia m s divertidos que piadosos se dejaron conducir hasta el comulgatorio donde el padre antonio isabel les puso en la frente la cruz de ceniza de regreso a casa cuando el menor quiso limpiarse la frente descubri que la mancha era indeleble y que lo eran tambi n la de sus hermanos probaron con agua y jab n con tierra y estropajo y por ltimo con piedra p mez y lej a y no consiguieron borrarse la cruz en cambio amaranta y los dem s que fueron a misa se la quitaron sin dificultad
2524772 fernanda sinti que un delicado viento de luz le arranc las s banas de las manos y las despleg en toda su amplitud amaranta sinti un temblor misterioso en los encajes de sus pollerines y trat de agarrarse de la s bana para no caer en el instante en que remedios la bella empezaba a elevarse rsula ya casi ciega fue la nica que tuvo serenidad para identificar la naturaleza de aquel viento irreparable y dej las s banas a merced de la luz viendo a remedios la bella que le dec a adi s con la mano
2524773 llovi cuatro a os once meses y dos d as
2524774 la ltima vez que le hab an ayudado a sacar la cuenta de su edad por los tiempos de la compa a bananera la hab a calculado entre ciento quince y los ciento veintid s a os
2524775 poco despu s cuando el carpintero tomaba las medidas para el ata d vieron a trav s de la ventana que estaba cayendo una llovizna de min sculas flores amarillas
2524776 s lo cuando lo voltearon boca abajo se dieron cuenta de que ten a algo m s que el resto de los hombres y se inclinaron para examinarlo era una cola de cerdo
2524777 y entonces vio al ni o era un pellejo hinchado y reseco que todas las hormigas del mundo iban arrastrando trabajosamente hacia sus madrigueras por el sendero de piedras del jard n
2524778 conservaba su fuerza descomunal que le permit a derribar un caballo agarr ndolo por las orejas
2524779 no supo en qu momento se le subi a las manos la fuerza juvenil con que derribaba un caballo
2524780 necesitaron diez hombres para tumbarlo catorce para amarrarlo veinte para arrastrarlo hasta el casta o del patio
2524781 promovi treinta y dos guerras y las perdi todas tuvo diecisiete hijos varones de diecisietes mujeres distintas que fueron exterminados en una sola noche escap a catorce atentados a setenta y tres emboscadas y a un pelot n de fusilamiento
2524782 se dispar un solo tiro de pistola en el pecho y el proyectil le sali por la espalda sin lastimar ning n centro vital
2524783 al cuidado de un mensajero que atraves la sierra se extravi en pantanos desmesurados remont r os tormentosos y estuvo a punto de perecer bajo el azote de las fieras la desesperaci n y la peste antes de conseguir una ruta de enlace con las mulas del correo

2524785 muchos a os despu s frente al pelot n de fusilamiento el coronel aureliano buend a hab a de recordar aquella tarde remota en que el padre lo llevo haber el hielo
2524786 sin embargo antes de llegar al verso final ya hab a comprendido que no saldr a jam s de ese cuarto pues estaba previsto que la ciudad de los espejos o espejismos seria arrasada por el viento y desterrada de la memoria de los hombres y en el instante en que aureliano babilonia acaba de descifrar los pergaminos y todo lo escrito en ellos era irrepetible desde siempre y para siempre porque las estirpes condenadas a cien a os de soledad no ten an una segunda oportunidad sobre la tierra
2524787 macondo era entonces una aldea de veintes casas de barro y ca abrava construidas a la orilla de un r o de aguas di fanas que se precipitaban por un lecho de piedras pulidas blancas y enormes como huevos prehist ricos
2524788 en pocos a os macondo fue la aldea m s ordenada y laboriosa que cualquiera de las conocidas hasta entonces por sus 300 habitantes era de verdad una aldea feliz donde nadie era mayor de treinta a os y donde nadie hab a muerto
2524789 macondo estaba en ruinas en los pantanos de las calles quedaban muebles despedazados esqueletos de animales cubiertos de liros colorados ltimos recuerdos de las hordas de advenedizos que se fugaron de macondo tan atolondradamente como hab an llegado
2524790 macondo era ya un pavoroso remolino de polvo y escombros
2524791 jos arcadio buend a quien decidi por esos a os que en las calles del pueblo se sembrar n almendros en vez de acacias y quien descubri sin revelarlos nunca los m todos para hacerlos eternos muchos a os despu s cuando macondo fue un campamento de casas de madera y techos de cinc todav a perduraban en las calles m s antiguas los almendros rotos y polvorientos aunque nadie sab a entonces quien los hab a sembrado
2524792 aureliano apareci vestido de terciopelo negro entre amaranta y rebeca ten a la languidez y la misma mirada clarividente que hab a detener a os m s tarde frente al pelot n de fusilamiento
2524793 muchos a os despu s frente al pelot n de fusilamiento el coronel aureliano buend a hab a de recordar aquella tarde remota en la que su padre lo llev a conocer el hielo macondo era entonces
2524794 el hijo de pilar ternera fue llevado a casa de sus abuelos a las dos semanas de nacido ursula lo admiti de mala gana vencida una vez m s por la terquedad de su marido que no pudo tolerar la idea de que un reto o de su sangre quedara navegando en la deriva pero impuso la condici n de que se ocultara al ni o su verdadera identidad aunque recibi el nombre de jos arcadio terminaron por llamarlo simplemente arcadio para evitar confusiones
2524795 cuando naci el hijo de aureliano y pilar ternera y fue llevada a la casa y bautizado en ceremonia ntima con el nombre de aureliano jos
2524796 que la historia de la familia era un engranaje de repeticiones irreparables una rueda giratoria que hubiera seguido dando vueltas hasta la eternidad de no haber sido por el desgaste progresivo e irremediable del eje
2524797 radicaba en que melqu ades no hab a ordenado los hechos en el tiempo convencional de los hombres sino que concentr un siglo de episodios cotidianos de modo que todos coexistieran en un instante
2524798 jos arcadio buend a que era el hombre m s emprendedor que se ver a jam s en la aldea
2524799 jos arcadio buend a se convirti en un hombre de aspecto de holgaz n descuidado en el vestir con una barba salvaje que ursula lograba cuadrar a duras penas con un cuchillo de cocina
2524800 pero poco a poco lo fue abandonando a su soledad porque cada vez se les hac a m s dif cil la comunicaci n estaba perdiendo la vista y el o do parec a confundir a los interlocutores con personas que conoci en pocas remotas de la humanidad y contestaba a las preguntas con un batiburillo de idiomas
2524801 esa noche pietro crespi lo encontr en el corredor llorando con el llantito sin gracias de los viejos llorando por prudencio aguilar por melaqu des por los padres de rebeca por su pap y su mam por todos los que pod a recordar y que entonces estaban solos en al muerte
2524802 entonces agarr la tranca de una puerta y con la violencia salvaje de su fuerza descomunal destroz hasta convertirlos en polvo los aparatos de alquimia
2524803 cuando llegaron rsula y amaranta todav a estaba atado de pies y manos al tronco del casta o empapado de lluvia y en un estado de inconciencia total le hablaron y l las mir sin reconocerlas y les dijo algo incomprensible
2524804 la laboriosa de rsula andaba a la par con la de su marido activa menuda severa aquella mujer de nervios inquebrantables a quien en ning n momento se la oy cantar parec a estar en todas partes desde el amanecer hasta muy entrada la noche siempre perseguida por el suave susurro de sus poller nes de ol n gracias a ella los pisos de tierra golpeada los r sticos muebles de madera construidos por ellos mismos estaban siempre limpios y los viejos arcones donde se guardaba la ropa exhalaban un tibio olor de albahaca
2524805 amaneci muerta el jueves santo la ltima vez que le hab an ayudado a sacar la cuenta de su edad por los tiempos de la compa a bananera la hab a calculado entre ciento quince y los ciento veintid s a os
2524806 un jueves de enero a las doce de la madrugada naci amaranta antes de que nadie entrara al cuarto rsula la examin minuciosamente era liviana y acuosa como una lagartija pero todas sus partes eran humanas
2524807 el domingo en efecto llega rebeca no tenia m s de once a os hab a hecho el penoso viaje desde manaure con unos traficantes de pieles que recibieron el encargo de entregarla junto con una carta en la casa de jos arcadio buend a pero que no pudieron explicar con precisi n qui n era la persona que les hab a pedido el favor
2524808 ten a la cabeza cuadrada el pelo hirsuto y el car cter voluntarioso de su padre aunque llevaba el mismo impulso de crecimiento y fortaleza f sica ya desde entonces era evidente que carec a de imaginaci n
2524809 aureliano es el primer ser humano que naci en macondo iba a cumplir seis a o en marzo era silencioso y retra do
2524810 la muerte de remedios no le produjo la conmoci n que tem a fue m s bien un sordo sentimiento de rabia que paulatinamente se disolvi en una frustraci n solitaria y pasiva semejante a la que experiment en los tiempos en que estaba restringido a vivir sin mujer
2524811 un d a en que el peque o aureliano a la edad de trece a os entr a la cocina en el momento en que ella retiraba del fog n y pon a en la mesa una olla de caldo hirviendo el ni o perplejo en la puerta dijo lt se va a caer gt la olla estaba bien puesta en el centro de la mesa pero tan pronto como el ni o hizo el anuncio inici un movimiento irrevocable hacia el borde como impulsada por un dinamismo interior y se desplazo en el suelo
2524812 el coronel arcadio buend a dispon a entonces de tiempo para enviar cada dos semanas un informe pormenorizador a macondo le escribi a rsula cuiden mucho a pap porque se va a morir rsula se alarm jos arcadio fue asesinado por unos ni os estos lo ahogaron
2524813 era un fugitivo de cuantas plagas y cat strofes hab an flagelado al g nero humano sobrevivi a la pelagra en persia al escorbuto en el archipi lago de malasia a la lepra en alejandr a al beriberi en el jap n a la peste bub nica en madagascar al terremoto de sicilia y a un naufragio multitudinario en el estrecho de magallanes aquel ser prodigioso que dec a poseer las claves de nostradamus era un hombre l gubre envuelto en un aura triste con una mirada asi tica que parec a conocer el otro lado de las cosas
2524814 y que todo lo escrito en ellos era irrepetible desde siempre y para siempre porque las estirpes condenadas a cien a os de soledad no ten an una segunda oportunidad sobre la tierra

2524819 mmhmm it looks great on me you should see it
2524820 the outfits f fine b but y you should g get o off me
2524821 if im so fine can you get off my fineness then
2524822 you should stop thinking that everything goes in your favor reina
2524823 estamos aprendiendo vamos dando paso a paso para ir creciendo que es lo m s importante
2524824 there are aspects there where we think during our legal review it would go beyond the constitutional provisions but in the end we never looked at an agenda of term extension that is not the ultimate objective
2524825 the ultimate objective is having peace in mindanao it just so happens that during these negotiations there might be a need for us to amend the constitution toward a federal system of government
2524826 senator pimentel himself told me that he will not allow his bill to have other riders or other aspects so he will just limit it to just a federal system we are not talking of parliamentary
2524827 so why sign the ancestral domain accord if you cannot deliver there may be another motive and that motive could be charter change
2524828 i dont think we are negotiating in bad faith we know we can be able to go from the moa to congress to enable it i think congress would hear us out if there is need for enactment of laws
2524829 i would like to believe that the president has the authority she has the ability to be able to push this through there is certainly an abundant political will that would drive her to ensure that whatever is agreed upon with the milf could be enabled and implemented
2524830 its not only for mindanao itself the expanded armm or the bangsamoro juridical entity but this is something that would help solve a lingering problem that we have of disorder in mindanao the continuing armed conflict that is affecting the whole republic in terms of the economy perceptions of investors if we can have peace in mindanao everyone knows especially our legislators that we can uplift the condition not only of mindanao but of the whole country
2524831 why dont we give them more economic powers a little bit of more political authority what is wrong with that this is still within the republic of the philippines
2524832 its the people who should tell us what they want if they dont then no
2524833 when you open charter change can you say its only up to this point
2524834 you can try a law establishing greater powers in the bje after all the concept of an autonomous government is in the constitution in fact the complaint is that the law that was passed is not real autonomy
2524835 thats why im saying when people should be happy with this breakthrough it becomes so suspect because the actions of the leadership raise so many questions on her real agenda
2524836 is this peace making by improvisation or is it cha cha not for peace but for political survival
2524837 thats why people are so afraid now that the position taken by the sc before that both houses should vote separately will no longer be the decision because majority of justices are already her appointees
2524838 whats happening is instead of a common ground that is being formed what you have is more suspicions and more divisions the peace process that is difficult is made more difficult due to her suspect moves
2524839 hes thought a lot about the countrys political future and how to adapt conservatism to changing demographics and pressures
2524840 mmhmm it looks great on me you should see it
2524841 the outfits f fine b but y you should g get o off me
2524842 if im so fine can you get off my fineness then
2524843 you should stop thinking that everything goes in your favor reina

2524852 in recent days we have seen two stark examples of exactly whats wrong with washington and whats at stake in this election first we learned that the federal budget deficit could reach a half a trillion dollars next year eight years after we had record surpluses we are faced with record deficits this mortgaging of our childrens future is a direct result of the bush administrations dangerously failed fiscal policies
2524853 instead of helping americans who are struggling we have seen loopholes and lavish giveaways for corporations who ship jobs overseas and tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them now senator mccain proposes to continue these costly and unfair bush tax policies hed continue to put special interests ahead of americans who are struggling while shortchanging the investments we need to get the american economy moving again
2524854 the second thing we learned this week was that the iraqi government has a 79 billion surplus thanks to their windfall oil profits and while this iraqi money sits in american banks american tax payers continue to spend 10 billion a month to defend and rebuild iraq thats right america faces a huge budget deficit iraq has a surplus senator mccain promises to continue president bushs opened ended commitment to the war in iraq while refusing to pressure iraqis to take responsibility for their own country
2524855 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2524856 the american people are worse off than they were eight years ago sen mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back we cant afford to take that chance we cant afford to keep running up record deficits while we favor the few over the many we cant prioritize a misguided war in iraq over the urgent needs of the american people
2524857 when our memories outweigh our dreams then we have grown old

2524876 the one guy who made plays all spring all over all the time was brian smith
2524877 and in this defense the guy who is in position to do that all the time is the middle linebacker so now toryans going to have his work cut out to get there ahead of brian but brian is the one guy who stood out for the coaching staff every day every play
2524878 pat weighed in at 288 this morning what ian has is a very low center of gravity if you watched kuntz play youll see that end his natural position of play pat has shown position flexibility where hes been able to play inside and out
2524879 those two veterans that have playing experience are going to battle it out at left tackle and may the best man win
2524880 now the one thing we do have is both paul and mike have some position flexibility where they could bounce inside and play guard im looking to get the best player out of those two guys one day one guy will be running with the first group and the next day the next guy will be running with the first group so that will be going back and forth until we go by what we see
2524881 obviously if you went off the spring robert had a phenomenal spring
2524882 if you were just picking off the spring you would put robert in and say youre first but james and robert would battle it out and armandos kind of off to the side
2524883 the feedback on michael floyd from jimmy clausen has been through the roof
2524884 he looks like an upperclassmen thats been around a long time
2524885 i dont mean just playing okay i dont mean just playing consistently
2524886 i mean guys that can make game breaking plays i think that its going to be interesting because the competition is going to be very very good because theres not a changeover theres just added players
2524887 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2524888 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2524889 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2524890 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes
2524891 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it

2524898 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2524899 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2524900 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2524901 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2524902 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2524903 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos

2524905 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2524906 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2524907 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2524908 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2524909 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social

2524914 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2524915 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2524916 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2524917 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2524918 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2524919 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences

2524941 blogs enhance social online networking where a campaign can be generated exponentially through a limitless number of ways well limited only by the number of bloggers who are willing to write about it and then link to each other and generate a buzz a blog should bring a positive tone and quality that aims to engage bloggers in long term community and change and only then will it be effective
2524942 what is measurable is the search engine page results serps of the keyword
2524943 even if they have already blogged about the filipina we need fresh content all the time second link to
2524944 we still have a long way to go google serps in europe does not show filipinaimages com in the first page same with msn and other search engines

2524948 everywhere he went he brought light and joy from your first breath you were loved beyond imagination
2524949 a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others
2524950 i graduated from my masters and had to come home as part of my contract on a more personal level after all the learning i wanted to be useful i felt that my country needed my skills more than the us did they had enough brilliant people there there were more opportunities to make a difference in the philippines more challenges to face more issues you can try to solve
2524951 i guess i was really scared in breaking rules since they were really more bent on implementing these than here in the philippines
2524952 they just speak whats on their minds and i had to condition myself that it was okay to do that here in the philippines i had to watch what i say because people were more sensitive
2524953 in the us people were more direct to the point and i had to train myself to receive what they say and also to say what i think i would always be amazed when a stranger approached me to compliment what im wearing i think filipinos are too shy to do that
2524954 i just missed the food all the fat grease and salt filipino songs it just has a different effect on me
2524955 given the unconscionably bad environmental state of the area in and around the site of the 2008 summer games we cannot in good conscience allow chinese athletes to compete in china
2524956 we deeply apologize to china for the bitter disappointment they will feel at not being represented in these games however we place the blame squarely on china for their failure to prepare a suitable venue for international competition
2524957 frankly it seems to me that in terms of air quality water purity and general contamination beijing is barely even capable of supporting human life let alone strenuous activities such as team sports swimming and long distance running
2524958 we can only hope our refusal to compete in this city will result in real change for its long suffering residents
2524959 a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others
2524960 women and gender advocacy training education and research in the age of ict wgater ict this is an action plan output of a trainers training on ict in 207 with apec digital opportunity center as lead sponsor
2524961 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2524962 i think our ict enabled services sector is fulfilling its promise of making a positive impact on our economy offering employment and bringing in revenue to the philippines all groups supporting this effort should work tightly together so that the end result is faster growth
2524963 the bpo and call center sector both outsourced and competitive remains to be the most attractive ict sub sector for pldt
2524964 another promising segment is the mobile workforce we are bullish that this will give us the most growth as broadband wireless coverage becomes more pervasive in the countryside and we dont just mean growth in terms of access but even on collateral business applications such as sales force automation erps work at home call center agent apps etc
2524965 we need end to end policies covering all the gray areas rules must be set and agreed upon with all the stakeholders
2524966 a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others

2524975 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2524976 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2524977 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2524978 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
2524979 it needs to be a part of resolving the problem and solving the problem and not contributing to it
2524980 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2524981 the first thing needed is to make the georgians return to their positions and re establish the status quo we had before
2524982 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2524983 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2524984 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2524985 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2524986 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2524987 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2524988 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2524989 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2524990 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2524991 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2524992 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2524993 russia has launched a full scale military operation on air land and sea we have entered a totally new realm politically legally and diplomatically
2524994 no georgia i believe started a war in southern ossetia and we are responsible to keep the peace
2524995 we have been appreciative of the american efforts to pacify the hawks in tbilisi apparently these efforts have not succeeded quite a number of officials in washignton were really shocked when all this happened
2524996 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2524997 they mark dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives are being lost and others are in danger
2524998 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2524999 we bocog promised free access except for a few websites that jeopardise our security and the healthy growth of our youth
2525000 thats an assessment made by the authorities of which sites are good and which are not good for our youth its like what any other country does
2525001 however the other day i was asked would i apologise and i said i would not apologise as the ioc do not run the internet in china

2525016 my loving people we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery but i assure you i do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people let tyrants fear i have always so behaved myself that under god i have placed my chiefest strength and safe guard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects and therefore i am come amongst you as you see at this time not for my recreation and disport but being resolved in the midst and heat of the battle to live or die amongst you all to lay down my life for my god and for my kingdom and for my people my honour and my blood even in the dust i know i have the body of a weak and feeble woman but i have the heart and stomach of a king and a king of england too and think foul scorn that parma or spain or any prince of europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm the which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me i myself will take up arms i myself will be your general judge and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field i know already for your forwardness you have deserved rewards and crowns and we do assure you in the word of a prince they shall be duly paid you in the meantime my lieutenant general shall be in my stead than whom never prince commanded a more noble or worthy subject not doubting but by your obedience to my general by your concord in the camp and your valour in the field we shall shortly have a famous victory over those enemies of my god of my kingdom and of my people
2525017 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of comm amp to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2525018 now this is from a vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from a president
2525019 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2525020 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by a way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby amp a shop around a vice president
2525021 i would naturally i would probably st amp on my basically my reputation amp say it came from a vice president
2525022 but are wasnt anything in a writing that you remember saying a vice president
2525023 you know if youve ever seen a vice presidents stationery its on a white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of a vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2525024 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but a issues in this matter are simply too important to st amp as discredited in any way

2525031 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2525032 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2525033 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2525034 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2525035 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2525036 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2525037 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2525038 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2525039 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2525040 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2525041 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2525042 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2525058 to be that kind of athlete you must be willing to sacrifice everything else in your life everything olympians rarely lead balanced lives because they choose to be single minded
2525059 but is that so different than the christian life we are called to be single minded in our pursuit of god to love the lord our god with all our heart and with all our mind and with all our strength and we must be willing to sacrifice everything else in life to pursue this one goal couldnt olympic athletes be role models for us in our faith walk

2525199 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2525200 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2525201 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2525202 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2525203 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2525204 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2525205 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2525206 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2525207 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2525208 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2525209 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2525210 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles

2525213 executive privilege claims that form the foundation of the executives resistance to the committees subpoenas are not foreign to federal courts either
2525214 in the thirty four years since united states v nixon was decided the courts have routinely considered questions of executive privilege or immunity
2525215 is not merely an investigation into the executives use of his removal power but rather a broader inquiry into whether improper partisan considerations have influenced prosecutorial discretion
2525216 defies both reason and precedent to say as the executive does that the committee which is charged with oversight of doj generally cannot permissibly employ its investigative resources on this subject
2525217 unique ability to address improper partisan influence in the prosecutorial process n o other institution will fill the vacuum if congress is unable to investigate and respond to this evil
2525218 the 110th congress expires on january 3 2009 unlike the senate the house is not a continuing body
2525219 on the committees side the entire house and thus any outstanding subpoenas will lapse on january 3 2009 and the basis of this lawsuit will cease to exist to be sure the incoming house of representatives may elect to re issue similar subpoenas but that remains speculative at this juncture similarly the incoming executive administration may decline to pursue the assertions of immunity and executive privilege that form the foundation of this dispute
2525220 a former president may still assert executive privilege but the claim necessarily has less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
2525221 as with the incoming congress there is no way to predict whether the new administration will support the assertions of privilege made in this case there is also the likelihood of appeal of this decision and given the significance of the issues involved a stay pending appeal is at least possible thus although proceedings before this court could be concluded prior to january 2009 any appeals process may not run its course before that date at that point the case would arguably become moot nevertheless the court concludes that this concern does not counsel against entertaining this case
2525222 lets get all this behind us so that the congress will not be fooling around with bush once the new president arrives

2525301 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2525302 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2525303 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2525304 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2525305 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2525306 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2525307 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2525308 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2525309 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2525310 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2525311 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2525312 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2525313 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social
2525314 el objetivo es sembrar para que crezca en el futuro un estado democr tico y desarrollado

2525325 this is a parish that does exactly what the holy father tells us to do celebrating the mass reverently in the old and new forms the bishop is determined to squash it and to destroy me because he doesnt want me moving to another parish and doing the same thing
2525326 the bishop believes your ministry to be divisive is uncertain that ordinary pastoral care of parishioners is taking place and does not have confidence that you will celebrate the ordinary form of the mass with a generous heart for the vast majority of parishioners who expect sunday and weekday masses to be in english and at an altar facing the people

2525418 strangely this year there are no out riders competing on any team
2525419 there is one rider who is married but is having an affair with a guy but so far hes not coming forward about it sad
2525420 you spend a day with these athletes and it becomes obvious that gay people are everywhere
2525421 the reason many of them arent out is because theyre focused on their job during this time when sports is the no 1 thing in their lives
2525422 she is religious and close to her mother she is also somewhat shy and fragile this beijing thing is going to be a major cultural shock she came out of nowhere and went from nothing to this but when she does come out and she will she will be an incredible role model
2525423 came in several times along with most of the team she never made a big deal about who she was or where she was going and of course seeing female athletes in the bar was commonplace she hooked up occasionally and i watched her make out a few times
2525424 i think that those who keep their sexuality secret and act overly heterosexual hinder the sport
2525425 my experience shows there are no more gay men competing in gymnastics than in any other sport
2525426 i think that for closeted elite gymnasts not only are they scared to be a role model for gay youth they are afraid that coming out will confirm the perception that they compete in a gay sport the misconceptions are so far from the truth gymnastics is one of the toughest hardest and most gruelingly difficult sports in the world

2525488 non centra niente dal commento di ieri sera sembrava che giocasse linter di 10 anni fa disponiamo di una linea mediana che mi sembra importante e anche lattacco apposto abbiamo dei problemi solo in difesa

2525490 quella vista ieri una bella inter che nn ha solo forza nelle gambe
2525491 st facendo bene nonostante le tante defezioni contro uninter che ha solo qualche assente in difesa
2525492 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore

2525499 infatti l avvento del fascismo stato colpa di quegli stronzi che si sono ritirati sull aventino invecde di farsi massacrare e di quel codardo di matteotti che ha preferito farsi ammazzare e lasciare cos campo libero al duce inoltre ricordiamolo non aveva senso prendersela con lui pi che sbagliato era inutile

2525514 they got a number of people down safely they definitely saved some lives
2525515 theres no way you should be camping up there for more than a day
2525516 he was up there for i think three or four nights hes a tough guy and hes got a very strong attitude so its mind over matter
2525517 i think anyone in the same situation would have done the same thing
2525518 mark seems to have steadied himself and come through it all right thank jesus for that

2525521 our leader wilco was miraculously found near c3 wandering around but was thought to be probably dead

2525524 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2525525 there are probably some workplaces where the f word is commonly used but it has no place in negotiations between employers and employees about wages and conditions
2525526 and as for you jennifer asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2525527 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately
2525528 its unrealistic to think you can ban bad language in the workplace
2525529 its a matter of context we are certainly against bad language when it is used as coercion but it can be a part of workplace banter
2525530 we dont want to be too politically correct about these things

2525538 since the beginning of time and till the end of times
2525539 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2525540 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2525541 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2525542 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

2525545 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2525546 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2525547 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2525548 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2525549 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2525556 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2525557 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2525558 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2525559 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

2525561 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2525562 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2525563 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2525564 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2525565 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2525566 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2525567 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2525568 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2525569 this aggression is carried out by the russian black sea navy large scale land operation and air forces
2525570 one brigade of georgian forces is in iraq and we are calling it home tomorrow
2525571 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2525572 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2525573 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2525574 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2525575 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2525576 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2525577 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2525578 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2525579 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2525580 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2525581 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2525582 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2525583 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2525584 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2525585 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2525586 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2525587 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2525588 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2525589 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2525590 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2525591 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2525592 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2525593 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2525594 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2525595 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2525596 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2525597 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2525598 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2525599 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2525600 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2525601 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2525602 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2525603 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2525604 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2525605 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2525606 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2525607 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2525608 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

2525610 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2525611 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2525612 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2525613 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2525614 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2525615 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2525616 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2525617 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2525618 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

2525620 we of course are all for people being materially better off
2525621 well im for me and my type being better off but only if we can tear down those other guys in the process
2525622 surely we can rely on the good will and superior knowledge of those making decisions to assure a good result
2525623 are you advocating state ownership of the means of production if so which ones how do you know what will result from such a program
2525624 are you advocating state ownership of the means of production as was advocated by tyrants those in control during the great kulak famine in the soviet union and the starvation at plymouth plantation
2525625 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2525626 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2525627 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2525628 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2525629 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2525630 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2525631 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2525632 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2525633 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2525653 we are again having cold weather i think day before yesterday was the most stormy day we have had the snow was about six inches deep for two or three days it had been snowing gradually and on friday afternoon it came down with great force at noon i left my house and returned to it after supper in the evening i found the snow everywhere throughout my house i measured it on a board and found it three inches deep inside my bed was also covered with snow three inches deep and i took my washbowl and with a sweep or two of the hand piled it heaping full and thawed it or melted it for wash water in the morning having to economize as i have to carry my water one mile

2525656 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2525657 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2525658 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2525659 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2525660 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2525661 who are open to doing something on the production side
2525662 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2525663 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

2525763 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2525764 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices

2525773 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2525799 i first got interested in this topic because people were telling me that the air fresheners in public restrooms and the scent from laundry products vented outdoors were making them sick
2525800 and i wanted to know whats in these products that is causing these effects
2525801 i was surprised by both the number and the potential toxicity of the chemicals that were found
2525802 nearly 100 volatile organic compounds were emitted from these six products and none were listed on any product label plus five of the six products emitted one or more carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants which are considered by the environmental protection agency to have no safe exposure level
2525803 be careful if you buy products with fragrance because you really dont know whats in them
2525804 id like to see better labeling in the meantime id recommend that instead of air fresheners people use ventilation and with laundry products choose fragrance free versions

2525867 i dont think well be able to get back to square one this has already created something that is not going to fade away easily this resentment and hostility
2525868 we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2525869 we all have to unite in this very important and difficult moment for our homeland when our future and our freedom are under threat
2525870 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
2525871 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves
2525872 la construction de colonies isra liennes est un probl me
2525873 yes great and when will george w bush and dick cheney face trial for war crimes

2525883 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2525884 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2525885 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2525886 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2525887 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2525888 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2525889 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2525890 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2525891 this is a brilliant marketing move for myspace or for hilton

2525949 sei da responsabilidade que o lyon tem no campeonato franc s e reconhe o que todos quem bater esse advers rio at porque j estive do outro lado recentemente mas vejo um grupo muito forte e capaz de superar todas as adversidades que est o por vir

2525952 we knew alonso was a very good player and as a result he had a good price on his head we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2525953 it could be that he does stay with us for me it is not a problem if he stays or not he can stay we always have felt he is a good player
2525954 we are only talking about a very very good price he is a good player if he is not going to bring a good price then it is very simple easy to understand
2525955 i heard the crowd obviously we know now as we knew before that he could stay with us
2525956 it is not positive that we may not have the players we want here before the champions league game standard liege
2525957 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital

2525960 it is a good test match wicket if you are a batsman you really have to work hard to get going i think it is a very good test match wicket
2525961 first things first we have to get them out as early as possible without letting them get a big lead that is what we are going to look for tomorrow
2525962 first session is crucial tomorrow from there we have to bat really well and put up a good total so that they have to bat last on this track
2525963 we are very hopeful for tomorrow the game is evenly poised now today a few decisions went here and there but we were really giving our best it could have gone either way from there we have to wait and watch how the game shapes up tomorrow
2525964 on any wicket you just have to run and give your best bowl in good areas and be patient and wait for batsmen to make mistakes
2525965 as he ronaldo gets older i think he will appreciate being here more and more the longer people stay at this club you tend to not want to leave
2525966 believe me it makes me proud to know how much he thinks of me
2525967 i love the passion he has for football if it were humanly possible i would like to have him always by my side of course its not possible but it shows how much affection admiration and respect i have for him he has always been like a second father to me at united
2525968 ill never forget it was him that explained the significance of the number 7 united shirt which will always be my shirt when i was at sporting i had a number of offers some of them very lucrative one of them offered eight million euros just as a signing on fee and meant that i would play for sporting for one more year and then leave as a free agent but money isnt everything real barcelona inter milan juventus valencia and practically all the big clubs were also interested
2525969 after wed won the champions league i felt that in five years i had helped win everything there was to win wed won the premier league twice and id won a host of individual awards including the best goalscorer in the premier league champions league and in europe
2525970 so i felt that maybe i needed a new challenge i never hid the fact that i wanted to play in spain at real madrid in particular and i thought this could be the right moment united and real are probably the two biggest clubs in the world and it would never be an easy decision to make
2525971 apart from the challenge everyone realises that spanish and portuguese culture and lifestyle are more similar those were the reasons that made me consider the change
2525972 apart from the reasons ive just given i also have to recognise that my family would welcome the change the chance of being an hours flight from my mother and the rest of my family was very attractive even more so playing for a club like real madrid
2525973 i know i have to deal with these circumstances even though its difficult sometimes but its harder to ask the same of the people i love the most
2525974 the people at united particularly the manager understood my reasons but we all eventually concluded that i should continue to wear that number 7 shirt its no sacrifice for me its a great honour i have important things to win in england i will give everything i have to united
2525975 i want to defend the european cup and help united become world champions not forgetting the league and other cups

2525987 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week
2525988 however a less hawkish statement on policy from the fomc federal open market committee on august 5 combined with sharply declining energy prices provided a powerful lift for dow jones industrials last week despite generally weak economic reports

2526002 were only going to put holland in in an emergency situation if we had lost too many guys and didnt want to put a starter back in
2526003 a big part of camp is trying to find your best 53 players so you want to do that to evaluate some of the younger players evaluate some of the older players
2526004 also you want to put your scheme together you want to grow as a team throughout the four preseason games and you want to come together as a unit the guys that are out there you want them to appear to be cohesive
2526005 both of them will get a chance to play with the starting defense and well evaluate both of them
2526006 when doctors told me i couldnt work again i think in the back of my mind i didnt accept that

2526014 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2526015 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2526016 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2526017 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2526018 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2526019 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2526020 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2526021 le match contre la chine sera bien plus important que celui douverture contre le br sil 0 1 dans notre groupe qualificatif au tournoi olympique de football
2526022 at that hearing were going to have more details about how the police overreacted
2526023 we are looking for restitution because it was such an excessive drain on resources
2526024 i was always trying to get after him because he was their best player so i tried to hurt him every time
2526025 we used to go at it with each other me and him almost got into a brawl on the field one time he was their guy on defense and i was our guy on offense so wed go at it
2526026 that was probably one of the most memorable moments of my high school career
2526027 i didnt know i had to take that many classes
2526028 there were some other schools he could have gone to that had lesser requirements
2526029 juco to colorado is hard to get in to he just liked it so much and really liked coach cabral and what they were going to do with him here that he just thought this was the best thing for him
2526030 so i had to have another person say it over to me again when the teacher was saying something i didnt fully understand it i didnt hear it the second time it was always hard
2526031 hes very determined very dedicated hes all about the sport of football
2526032 it was time management making sure you get all of your work done
2526033 i think its a case of reaching down and finding those guys that have a zeal for that have a passion
2526034 he went through some emotions i think in essence of wondering where to go to school and what to do i think once he made his mind up he had a definite plan and he was one of those guys where every time you talked to him he knew exactly what it is he had to do and he was on it
2526035 its a real credit to him your heart goes out to those guys that are able to reach down deep and get it done
2526036 by and large we coaches have been doing this for a while and we can kind of take a look at a guy and go hes better suited for this spot i just think hes better suited for that

2526047 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
2526048 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
2526049 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

2526083 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
2526084 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
2526085 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
2526086 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
2526087 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
2526088 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
2526089 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
2526090 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
2526091 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
2526092 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
2526093 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
2526094 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
2526095 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
2526096 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
2526097 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
2526098 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
2526099 how do they market themselves or how is their medium distributed
2526100 by all means continue destroying my possessions i daresay i have too many
2526101 i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it
2526102 i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness

2526107 hes real encouraged and the doctors are too it will be immobilized over the weekend
2526108 the way they say these things happen it could be a lot worse it just hurt a lot when it happened but it feels better now i have heard about people who come back from this in a short period of time and others in a long period im hoping mine is short
2526109 nothing torn and no cartilage problems its the best case scenario
2526110 i thought it was very tough my horse is 100 percent fit and it is suitable for the course the test is that i dont stuff it up and take a wrong line
2526111 he did everything i asked he was agile wide awake fully switched on i noticed his eagerness
2526112 of course horses notice these things they are flight animals by nature and had to look out for wolves
2526113 the groom heard a bang in the stables during a thunderstorm yesterday morning we didnt think it was serious but when we were warming the horse up today we saw he was not well he is injured on the hind leg

2526126 grandiosa fortunatamente gi ero riuscito a vincere al bernabeu con il mio gol unimpresa che volevamo a tutti i costi consapevoli che potevamo battere il real madrid dopo torino abbiamo trovato una continuit di gioco risultato e condizione fisica adesso stiamo facendo grandi partite speriamo di continuare su questi livelli
2526127 su quattro ho avuto una sola sconfitta due vittorie ed un pareggio
2526128 ci siamo arrivati queste sono le partite pi belle quando si arriva alla fine
2526129 e la realt non sto al 100 ancora fortunatamente in queste tre ultime settimane sono riuscito ad allenarmi con continuit ora sto tornando nelle migliori condizioni
2526130 sicuramente ci saranno tante persone ad aspettarci tutta roma voleva vincere questa partita e noi siamo riusciti a conquistarla sul campo festeggiare con i nostri tifosi la cosa pi bella
2526131 noi siamo consapevoli che possiamo fare bene sia in italia che in europa ma dobbiamo essere umili e giocare come stiamo facendo ora facendo quello che ci dice di fare il mister
2526132 so che la champions una competizione importante per la vincita di questo trofeo spero di rendere al massimo in questi anni e centrare lobiettivo ma io penso alla roma poi se dovesse arrivare il pallone doro ovviamente sarei contento
2526133 i didnt really have time to think about anything there was less pressure
2526134 i used to stress out a week in advance and now i just did my thing
2526135 not to feel the kind of apparatus before you do gymnastics on it is kind of tough
2526136 but ive been doing these routines for a while now and im pretty confident in what i do

2526140 china and japan they will fight for gold and silver and the other teams will fight for the bronze
2526141 although we made some small mistakes we did a great job in general we are competing at the right time and right place with support from the people of our country
2526142 there was indeed a lot of pressure i was nervous
2526143 they have been waiting for years for this and they will be ready
2526144 we had a mishmash of players here at the time
2526145 but we could see the enthusiasm then for their womens team theyve put a lot of time money resources into the womens program the last four years its been about building it up and getting on that medal stand so we know its going to be a tough match
2526146 we gained some confidence but know that the americans were at half strength
2526147 we have nothing to lose in this game all the pressure is on them
2526148 we gave up a couple of easy buckets but they executed were not going to come out and be up by 20 in the first 2 minutes we executed our game plan and eventually got up big
2526149 sometimes you think things are going to be easy from the get go and theyre not
2526150 were playing against very good teams that have been together for a long time
2526151 he knows the players and wants to learn about the international game
2526152 it was awesome i know he had to leave early
2526153 its an honor that he came out and watched us perform and that he is a fan of the womens basketball
2526154 just to come out here tonight and see how many fans were supporting us and that our president was out here was good
2526155 yeah right i cant even brush my teeth in peace just bear with me here
2526156 philosophy is perfectly right in saying that life must be understood backward but then one forgets that it must be lived forward
2526157 if i only knew then what i know now i never would have decided that
2526158 absolutely nothing went our way so were going to have to take care of business
2526159 phil was making uncharacteristic errors ive not seen him make in two years he usually cracks these balls away and the crowd goes wild but even he was saying whats going on

2526182 sen obama needs at least 300 foreign policy advisers probably a lot more
2526183 hes spent very little time learning about traveling reflecting on and being involved in national security issues in recent years
2526184 theres not a significant national security issue of the past 20 or more years that he has not been centrally involved in
2526185 we dont have a mini state department or a mini defense department here in one sense sen mccain needs foreign policy advisers like tiger woods needs a golf coach
2526186 sen obamas own life experiences have given him a unique perspective on the complexities of the world
2526187 is extremely aware of emerging issues and threats comfortable processing complex information and rendering correct judgments on key issues such as iraq nonproliferation and afghanistan
2526188 they feel that iraq and afghanistan have sucked all of the oxygen out of the foreign policy and the national security policy agenda in the bush administration

2526292 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2526293 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2526294 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2526295 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2526296 he was dying thats what they told me he was basically living on charity the church had paid for his living situation my concern was just to help everybody else
2526297 i was escorted out of las vegas and i havent been back
2526298 much of it is propaganda telling the defense department what they want to hear
2526299 based on all credible information to date the iaea has found no indications of iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons
2526300 information from a high ranking iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected
2526301 viewed war in lebanon as a curtain raiser to attack on iran
2526302 the israelis told us it would be a cheap war with many benefits why oppose it well be able to hunt down and bomb missiles tunnels and bunkers from the air it would be a demo for iran
2526303 we told israel look if you guys have to go were behind you all the way but we think it should be sooner rather than later the longer you wait the less time we have to evaluate and plan for iran before bush gets out of office
2526304 israels military response by air land and sea to what it considered a provocation last week by hizbollah militants was unfolding according to a plan finalised more than a year ago
2526305 of all of israels wars since 1948 this was the one for which israel was most prepared
2526306 ease israels security concerns and also serve as a prelude to a potential american pre emptive attack
2526307 we do what we think is best for us and if it happens to meet americas requirements thats just part of a relationship between two friends hizbollah is armed to the teeth and trained in the most advanced technology of guerrilla warfare it was just a matter of time
2526308 if there was to be a military option against irans nuclear facilities it had to get rid of the weapons that hizbollah could use in a potential retaliation at israel bush was going after iran as part of the axis of evil and its nuclear sites and he was interested in going after hizbollah as part of his interest in democratisation
2526309 the suggestion that the us and israel planned and co ordinated an attack on hizbollah and did so as a prelude to an attack on iran is just flat wrong
2526310 t he only thing that the bombing has achieved so far is to unite the population against the israelis
2526311 aware of latency and take into account issues of concurrency and partial failure
2526312 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2526313 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2526314 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2526315 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2526316 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2526317 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2526318 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2526319 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen

2526325 oooo lucky me to have such a randy bloke and one who truly wants me
2526326 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2526327 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2526328 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2526329 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2526330 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2526331 these arent the most important buildings in ohio by any means but collectively the wright field historic district is very important and these buildings are part of that
2526332 the only way to clean up the contamination which is under the slab of the building is to take the building down and dig out the contamination
2526333 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2526334 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2526335 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2526336 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2526337 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2526338 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2526339 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2526340 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2526341 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2526342 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2526343 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2526344 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2526345 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2526346 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2526347 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2526348 sorry for the delay yep im out of town but not on vacation unfortunately

2526352 go to each of your vendors every 6 9 months and ask for 10 30 off if half of them say yes youll save 5 15 on fixed costs people will give you a discount if they think they are going to lose the business
2526353 the fact of the matter is this case is going forward
2526354 we compared her picture to my twins and other children and we think its her
2526355 were just sitting here and hoping that if it is him there will be some closure
2526356 at least someone has been apprehended and thats one more person thats not going to do this to more families
2526357 this wouldnt have happened without the support and desire of ninas family
2526358 in my experience there havent been similar deals because in my experience there havent been similar cases
2526359 burns in hell for what hes done to the most amazing person one could meet in their lives
2526360 whats left is to thank ninas mother irina sharanova for the amazing person she raised and hopefully ninas children will become the same people nina once was
2526361 its like blackmail as a juror i feel it was first degree murder hes a coldblooded killer
2526362 his motivation for taking authorities to the grave was to put some resolution to the whole thing and improve his posture with the case and bring closure to the family
2526363 he realized that to ever be paroled he would have to acknowledge responsibility and show remorse
2526364 we think he might have seen something that can help us resolve this case
2526365 we had several witnesses who saw the man and several other witnesses who heard gun shots
2526366 oooh look at the goats look its goats theyre sooooo cute

2526371 there is a lot of anger in this community as to the way the police handled it they are blaming police for allowing a loyalist mob into what is not exclusively but a majority nationalist republican street
2526372 it is time that people showed more respect for their neighbours and time that the small minority who seem intent on creating trouble sought out new and peaceful ways to resolve their differences

2526381 governments seeking the benefits of open standards need to consider the role of interoperability while the best implementations may result in formatting problems the worst implementations actually lose information e g information found in pictures footnotes comments tracking changes and tables we consider several implications of these results including the lack of perfect compatibility between implementations the lack of good implementations outside of windows and the surprisingly good overall performance of ooxml implementations

2526388 were professional players i mean if you find somebody that says aw were comfortable and these games right now dont matter i will slap them right now every day as a professional player you try to win every day and thats what were doing
2526389 weve used him as a starter in long relief and just for an inning hes throwing strikes
2526390 we fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 p m and 11 39 p m on friday which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium
2526391 all doping charges against monika have been cleared by sai but ioa has not agreed on the ground that time is very short and they wont be able to reopen the entry process for her but they will be trying to send her to beijing
2526392 thats why we call it a team at some point in the season all 25 count
2526393 i know what my job is i just got to stay ready when they need me
2526394 its a little odd to play against a group of individuals that ive been so close to for so long its like playing in the backyard with your family so its different that way
2526395 but you know you got to separate and move on
2526396 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
2526397 he looked more like the old liriano like the one before
2526398 its only going to get better hes only going to get stronger
2526399 he wants to get back to where he is now more than anybody
2526400 hes a strong minded guy thats why hes good thats why hes at where hes at
2526401 we need to do a better job getting to the relievers with a good lead
2526402 right now our struggles are were swinging at some pitches we shouldnt be swinging at
2526403 overall we just need to put together some good at bats and try to string some things together
2526404 i knew i was going to have to get through the game without my best stuff
2526405 i had never faced peavy before so thats all i was trying to do and i was able to put a good swing on it
2526406 he threw well today i saw the good movement on the fastball maybe a little more movement
2526407 i was feeling very rusty early if you saw the first couple of swings
2526408 thats to be expected after going 15 days and not seeing a pitch but it came back quickly
2526409 usually if we get four or five runs we typically win
2526410 all in all it was kind of ugly in the first inning im human i cant go out there and put up zeros inning after inning
2526411 over the last couple of months i dont think theres been a better player in the league not just hitting but fielding too
2526412 i knew i hit it well but i saw him dive for the ball and said noooo
2526413 when things are going bad what can go bad will go bad
2526414 it doesnt last forever but when youre in it it feels like it
2526415 any time you can help the team out especially with an rbi is kind of lucky
2526416 but if it can happen a few times then you feel better about the whole game as a complete package
2526417 the addition of manny and now of penny is a big lift for us
2526418 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should play better than this
2526419 i can talk about the starting rotation every time we cross the line we want to do our best maybe half of the team dont have that mentality
2526420 when a team is on a bad roll as were the as you want to keep them down
2526421 it just got worse as the night went on i dont know if i can play tomorrow we just have to see
2526422 as far as getting some key hits we werent able to do that tonight
2526423 we just need to suck this one up move on to saturday and see what happens then
2526424 its really my pleasure to be able to manage a guy like roy because theres not much management to it its just pretty much put him out there and let him go and leave him alone

2526426 i cant afford this mortgage its up to 2 400 a month
2526427 i cant even open the bills it makes me so insane
2526428 its a catch 22 banks dont want to open the floodgates to anyone who wants to modify their mortgage
2526429 i would never tell anybody to stop making payments to manipulate a bank but the banks attitude is were not going to negotiate until its clear you cant make your house payment

2526444 its a just an honour being asked to perform it at a big sporting event like this im very excited to go
2526445 i always wanted to represent my country at the olympics
2526446 but since karate is not an official olympic sport this is the next best thing
2526447 for best olympic torch lighting moment id have to go with the 94 lillehammer games
2526448 what a joke of a race i should have stayed home all it was was a 10 lap shoot out

2526502 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2526503 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2526504 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2526505 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a

2526511 given those numbers in our view the unions are in a unique position to help us
2526512 until we have a better understanding its very difficult for us to make any choices
2526513 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2526514 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2526515 to the best of my knowledge this is a random action and not targeted at americans its just that you dont expect something to happen in a country like this
2526516 the chinese government will try not to let this event have a serious impact on u
2526517 im saddened but that doesnt make me think any less of this country
2526518 my feeling is that this has nothing to do with china
2526519 this is clearly an opportunity for some key leaders in china to show their human side
2526520 of course its a little scary but any time you have so many coming together there is a chance that something like this would happen
2526521 im very surprised because all of the locals we have met say its very safe
2526522 china is the friendliest place for americans that ive ever traveled period
2526523 even after this i still feel safer walking down the street in the middle of the night than i do in philadelphia
2526524 we are what we think with our thoughts we make the world
2526525 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them
2526526 you bring out something in people that they arent used to so they react to you in the strangest of ways
2526527 they are a really christian family theres not one person who has ever met them who has a negative thing to say about them theyre a great family
2526528 they would leave little messages for the players the whole reason they were here is because their life is usa volleyball
2526529 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2526530 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2526531 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2526532 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2526533 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2526534 to open religious services and make some literature available to a limited number of people during the olympics is a welcome thing but it means nothing in terms of religious freedom in china
2526535 it would mean more if beijing residents are able to access the bible and other religious literature in a public bookstore and if chinese citizens could choose their places of worship without being afraid of harassment being arrested or sent to labor camps
2526536 i dont care if this is a legal church or an illegal one
2526537 in china there are so many things the government doesnt allow but that doesnt mean that everything banned is bad
2526538 everyone should ask themselves what they truly believe in were all adults we have the ability to decide what we believe in to judge what is right or wrong people wont listen just because the government says so
2526539 in a way its a kind of progress that we are still able to operate
2526540 it shows that the government is worried about its international image
2526541 for some big house churches in cities like beijing and shanghai the government might not push too hard because theyre afraid of a backlash or creating an influential news story
2526542 but for small house churches including many in the countryside the crackdown is very serious
2526543 an important reason for the crackdown is the olympics this year chinese leaders face more pressure from outside groups house churches and even ordinary individual citizens
2526544 the public security bureau always misuses its power they have lost their humanity
2526545 the police are saying we cannot go onto the a30 and therefore it the route to the new post office is too dangerous
2526546 its no good any of us thinking we can do it
2526547 im concerned about the domino effect itll have itll take the heart out of the village in many ways

2526549 two ana sergeants began to rally some of their fellow soldiers and direct their frustration towards the royal irish soldiers in the base
2526550 as the evening wore on a crowd of local nationals gathered outside the patrol base again fuelled by this small discontented ana group
2526551 warnings were given by the locals for the ana to move out of the base so they could deal with the uk troops left there
2526552 a senior ana officer was flown out to the patrol base and having assessed the situation placed the two ana sergeants under arrest
2526553 the force responded with small arms fire killing the militants and inadvertently killing four women and a child located with them

2526610 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2526611 i am today holding high level consultations with european foreign ministers and with the us secretary of state
2526612 the uk will be discussing with all our partners how to stop the spread of violence secure a ceasefire and get talks underway
2526613 this move coupled with russias recent lifting of cis sanctions that opens the possibility for military assistance to abkhazia has significantly increased tensions in an already volatile region
2526614 in this regard we expect russia to live up to its recent assurances that russia will abide by its international commitments and responsibilities not to supply weapons to conflict zones and to maintain russian sanctions on the transfer of military services and equipment to separatist regions

2526619 its the first bad outing ive had in a long time since the all star break
2526620 im not going to look much into it i felt like i made some good pitches im just not too upset about it
2526621 what was it a bunch of singles and three doubles or so
2526622 im just not real upset about it im going to move on i already have done that
2526623 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2526624 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2526625 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2526626 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2526627 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2526628 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2526629 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2526630 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2526631 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2526632 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2526633 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2526634 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2526635 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2526636 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2526637 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2526638 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2526639 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2526640 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2526641 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2526642 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2526643 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2526644 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2526645 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2526646 he is such a nice chap that none of us mind
2526647 i have been sailing flying 15s for 25 years i used to race with my dad and now i race with my 11 year old daughter eleanor they are lovely boats and we love being out there you might not think it but it is a very competitive class and some of the younger guys are hopeful that they might topple rupert one day
2526648 it was quite tense because we were in 5th place at the first mark and if we had stayed there we would not have won overall
2526649 we have taken this very seriously we are professional sailors so treated it as part of our training programme and feel that we made a clear progression it has been a fantastic regatta and we are really pleased to have won
2526650 the crew are pretty disappointed but it was all my fault
2526651 my tactician advised me not to put it up because we were in the lead and only needed to stay in front of amey love shack to win the overall prize but i wanted to put it up for a bit of fun
2526652 this was not in the plan at all but it is very exciting
2526653 if they win tomorrow and we come second we win overall if they win and we come third they win overall if we win we win
2526654 the forecast is for wind which suits us because we are the fat boys of the fleet but julia has to be favourite because she is a very good competitor shes clever with a very good crew
2526655 we were in a difficult situation facing a complex building depression whose passage is hard to forecast
2526656 these depressions can generate strong very strong winds from the south west in the st georges channel on the return down from the isle of man and no doubt would have meant finishing the race in ireland i have therefore preferred to set a new course that is long and which is still interesting sports wise and that will also get the skippers into laber wrach before the very strong winds hit even tough we would have preferred to have this long leg one that we have been planning and thinking of doing for a long time you cant go against nature particularly when it comes down to the safety of the competitors we are not here to play circus games it is nature that dictates the law here the leg some 500 miles will still be interesting and with lots options to play with
2526657 with this new course i loose the advantage of sailing in home waters initially it will be tough to sail up to the new buoy then it should be slightly easier this does swing back into the favour of those who sail around there and know the area well
2526658 effectively we will be doing a 500 mile windward leeward race with a spreader mark

2526664 the crowd parted he tipped his hat i shot it real quick its one of the few instances when i knew i had taken a really great photo
2526665 you dont know how fast and how widespread that can happen until it does the reach of it is insane
2526666 they want the diversity of photography that were seeing on the web
2526667 theyre tired of old cheesy looking stock images they want black latino or asian subjects
2526668 you dont need to be a full time pro to monetize your photography
2526669 my images are stolen all the time all over the world thats perfectly fine and good for me
2526670 people steal it and they make it more and more popular that makes it more likely legitimate people will license it
2526671 should a car dealer in austin have to pay as much as toyota in japan
2526672 i get a lot more exposure when i share them than if i put them behind an all rights reserved wall
2526673 every photo i have on flickr is with a camera i carry in my pocket
2526674 she said i had some talent and suggested i take it more seriously
2526675 that led to me upgrading to professional grade equipment and seeking out more actively some paying roles
2526676 the last thing you want to see is a photo thats important to you used in a satire or in a youtube video you object to morally
2526677 people have to balance the accessibility of their images versus the way people might misuse those images online

2526682 pay the bill on time pay the bill on time and pay the bill on time
2526683 their perfect customer is someone who pays on time but does not pay in full
2526684 a number generated by a mathematical algorithm a formula based on information in your credit report compared to information on tens of millions of other people the resulting number is a highly accurate prediction of how likely you are to pay your bills
2526685 here you are a freshman new to credit new to college
2526686 what you do today can and will affect loans you get when you have graduated

2526690 we have 30 knots from the south southwest and its damp the skies are dark and the sea is rough with a short and uncomfortable chop which is only going to worsen
2526691 the wind continues to come in from the south southwest with 25 to 30 knots and gusts of up to 40 the shift to the west southwest should come from around 23 00 tonight
2526692 it is going to get worse and worse and we could well see 4 to 5 metre waves close to brittany buoy
2526693 i am sailing under solent and am well prepared for this front the boat is fine and i am doing well i am ready for the battle right now i have 23 to 24 knots of wind we have a short chop and it really is like being in a field of spaghetti with all the seaweed around for now all is good and luisina is going fast earlier i was close to erwan and passed him so my boat speed is good the wind has freshened but it is going to get stronger especially with the gusts you feel like the depression is almost stationary and is going to stay like that for some time so we all have wind the main thing we have to be set properly and try and avoid these big floating banks of seaweed by tonight we should pass the tip of brittany and further offshore we should not have so much
2526694 we have headed out into the english channel with quite a bit of wind which has rotated round to the left but all is good right now we are on a direct course to the mark we are gobbling up the miles to the brittany weather mark which is a good thing i changed to solent not that long ago maybe a bit late actually because the wind has really come in now when i went to change the sail the autopilot force tacked the boat so i found myself under the genoa and with the full water ballast below so my oilies a just slightly wet the sea is not all that rough yet but it is going to come i let the autopilot drive the boat for most of last night so managed to get some sleep and rearing to go

2526705 council staff around britain went on strike last month over a 2 45 percent pay rise happily their paymasters have felt less constrained in awarding themselves more generous rises
2526706 at east cambridgeshire district council senior members have just trousered a modest 94 percent increase in their allowances while at the same time cutting the arts budget by 70 000 and forcing the closure of a gallery in ely the 94 percent is for committee chairs with ordinary members getting a mere 10 percent rise costing the council 22 000
2526707 the death penalty is about revenge and hate and revenge and hate is why my daughter and those 167 other people are dead today
2526708 i have come to believe that the death penalty is not what will help me heal responding to one killing with another killing does not honor my daughter nor does it help create the kind of society i want to live in where human life and human rights are valued i know that an execution creates another grieving family and causing pain to another family does not lessen my own pain
2526709 it really sounds like angel diaz was tortured to death

2526727 juries make mistakes prosecutors make mistakes if you are for the death penalty you have to say we are going to lose innocent lives but it is worth it

2526857 as one who is in the lord jesus i am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself

2526861 i also think im leaving the district in a very good place i wouldnt want to leave the district if it were in great need
2526862 kind of a rollercoaster with good moments and bad moments
2526863 if anything we would have liked to have seen change in that culture from the central administration that tends to be top down in its decision making

2526869 students are involved in the process of getting food scraps from the cafeteria kitchen to put in the compost and after watching the compost go through its process and mixing it with the soil in the garden they grow and eat vegetables the next fall and they know that the compost that helped feed those plants came from their own kitchen its really about seeing the cycle of nature and being involved with it

2526881 i think its significant that the university has agreed to do this and i applaud them for it

2526899 go it will be done just as you believed it would
2526900 just as you believed just as you believed just as you believed
2526901 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
2526902 if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
2526903 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future
2526904 in the last days there will be very difficult times for people will love only themselves and their money they will be boastful and proud scoffing at god disobedient to their parents and ungrateful they will consider nothing sacred they will be unloving and unforgiving they will slander others and have no self control they will be cruel and hate what is good they will betray their friends be reckless be puffed up with pride and love pleasure rather than god they will act religious but they will reject the power that could make them godly stay away from people like that
2526905 as iron sharpens iron so a friend sharpens a friend
2526906 and we are confident that he god hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases him and since we know he hears us when we make our requests we also know that he will give us what we ask for
2526907 the holy spirit is quick to remind you if your mind is beginning to take you in a wrong direction then the decision becomes yours will you flow in the mind of the flesh or in the mind of the spirit one leads to death the other life the choice is yours

2526935 but part of what makes a city dynamic is the way that its citizens deal with its problems and people here are nothing if not imaginative at problem solving indeed the mexicans and their ingenuity are very much a part of what gives mexico city its dynamic energy

2526953 they must act to protect them because as the most marginalised group in this world it spells out how the rest of us will be treated and is also the surest way to protect our last remaining ecosystems
2526954 many climate change scientists share this view they think the indigenous peoples can play a vital role in preserving biodiversity and the planets resources because they live in close proximity with nature

2526964 ik ben zo goed als hersteld van de hamstringblessure waar ik voor de winterstop last van had dus ik zou kunnen spelen voor rbc
2526965 maar ik heb eerst nog een gesprek met rob meppelink
2526966 via mijn zaakwaarnemer ben ik volop in gesprek met vvv hoe dat afloopt weet ik nog niet
2526967 ik heb nog niemand van vvv gesproken maar via peters zaakwaarnemer begrijp ik dat de interesse groot is zolang dat echter niet uitmondt in een concreet bod kan ik er niks mee
2526968 ik neem aan dat peter zelf ook zo zijn voorwaarden heeft richting vvv waar hij uit zal moeten komen
2526969 eerst eens kijken of hij echt gaat het zou jammer zijn we leveren dan toch weer kwaliteit in die niet zomaar terug te halen is voor een bedrag dat rbc kan ophoesten het is mooi dat we een speler zon opstap naar de eredivisie kunnen bieden maar nadelig voor de club rbc de supporters de spelersgroep en indirect mezelf maar dat is de voetballerij
2526970 maar waarom zou dat mourinho niet kunnen zijn hij zou tot de zomer duits kunnen leren mourinho is zeker in beeld wij hebben een topper nodig en dat is hij
2526971 er zijn ontzettend veel kandidaten voor de baan de enige persoon waarvan ik zeker weet dat hij het niet zal worden ben ikzelf mijn god ik zou er niet aan moeten denken
2526972 nu ga ik met de club praten hoe we dit oplossen
2526973 nadat koeman naar valencia was vertrokken heb ik een gesprek gehad met psv
2526974 daarin gaf de clubleiding aan dat mijn situatie veranderd was
2526975 ze zeiden dat koeman degene was die mij graag naar psv wilde halen nu hadden ze drie vier man voor mijn positie ze wilden graag meewerken aan een transfer als er zich een club zou melden zo is het balletje gaan rollen
2526976 je kunt de situatie raar noemen het is nooit om leuk te horen maar je moet het respecteren het is de keuze van psv
2526977 ook na het gesprek heb ik me volledig ingezet voor psv jan wouters had een andere visie waar ik niet in paste alhoewel ik de laatste drie wedstrijden daar toch wel in paste kennelijk want toen speelde ik maar goed dat is zijn goed recht ik ben blij dat mijn laatste balcontact een doelpunt was
2526978 nu ik mijn eerste doelpunt heb gemaakt ben ik er zeker van dat er meer gaan volgen
2526979 ik speel momenteel niet op een niveau waar ik tevreden mee ben ik wil mezelf graag verbeteren op de bank lukt dat niet
2526980 ik heb pech gehad met die blessures maar nu ben ik terug
2526981 schuster feliciteerde me met het doelpunt en vertelde dat ik met wat meer geluk er zeker nog drie of vier extra doelpunten had kunnen maken
2526982 er is altijd druk als je een van de grote aankopen bent bij chelsea ben ik aan dit soort dingen gewend geraakt
2526983 het is enige wat ik kan doen is hard werken zodat iedereen straks tevreden over mij is
2526984 dat zijn onzinverhalen ik snap niet waar die vandaan komen
2526985 misschien is het voor mij moeilijk om te communiceren omdat mijn spaans nog niet zo goed is maar ik kan uitstekend overweg met mijn collegas ik herhaal het is onzin
2526986 de kans dat de transfer niet doorgaat schat ik op 80 tot 90 procent
2526987 er doemen steeds nieuwe obstakels op waarbij az machteloos staat
2526988 zoals het er nu voorstaat gaat de transfer niet door we zijn zeer teleurgesteld voorlopig is er geen nieuwe afspraak gemaakt de kans dat de transfer niet doorgaat schat ik op 80 tot 90 procent
2526989 we zijn wel met een alternatief bezig maar ook die komt waarschijnlijk niet naar alkmaar

2527001 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2527002 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2527003 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2527004 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2527005 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2527012 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2527013 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2527014 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2527238 non esistono studi che permettano di concludere senza equivoci che la psicoanalisi efficace rispetto a un placebo attivo o a unaltra forma di trattamento non ci sono metodi disponibili che possano incontestabilmente indicare lesistenza di un processo psicoanalitico la maggior parte degli studi ha dei limiti maggiori che potrebbero indurre coloro che criticano la disciplina a non tenere conto dei risultati altri studi hanno dei limiti cos gravi che persino un valutatore che abbia della simpatia per la psicoanalisi potrebbe essere incline a non tenere conto dei loro risultati

2527246 that discussed the advantages of obamas much touted voter registration program
2527247 here are virginias numbers the addition of 151 000 new voters by the registration deadline of october 6 based on experience the campaign believes about 75 of these new voters will show up on election day and 80 of those newly registered will likely be obama voters mostly this is because the people out there registering voters are wearing obama t shirts and stickers or sitting behind tables with obama banners taped to their front that naturally attract undecideds and those inclined to support obama in virginias case that translates to nearly 68 000 extra votes for obama uncaptured by pollsters in current polling given that virginias general election turnout was 3 2m in 2004 and projecting turnout of 3 5m in 2008 banking 68 000 new votes means obama would start out with a 1 9 to 0 structural advantage

2527250 to open religious services and make some literature available to a limited number of people during the olympics is a welcome thing but it means nothing in terms of religious freedom in china
2527251 it would mean more if beijing residents are able to access the bible and other religious literature in a public bookstore and if chinese citizens could choose their places of worship without being afraid of harassment being arrested or sent to labor camps
2527252 i dont care if this is a legal church or an illegal one
2527253 in china there are so many things the government doesnt allow but that doesnt mean that everything banned is bad
2527254 everyone should ask themselves what they truly believe in were all adults we have the ability to decide what we believe in to judge what is right or wrong people wont listen just because the government says so
2527255 in a way its a kind of progress that we are still able to operate
2527256 it shows that the government is worried about its international image
2527257 for some big house churches in cities like beijing and shanghai the government might not push too hard because theyre afraid of a backlash or creating an influential news story
2527258 but for small house churches including many in the countryside the crackdown is very serious
2527259 an important reason for the crackdown is the olympics this year chinese leaders face more pressure from outside groups house churches and even ordinary individual citizens

2527262 and when i said leaving i do not mean leaving you and move somewhere else oh no that would be to kind and you deserve much worse even if this means taking my life maybe you found this piece of paper a scorn thing that dont worth reading maybe you dont care about me i know youve never loved me but surpsingly i did neither but at least i cared about you ill nourish this everytime you came home from work youve never had time for me youve never had time for us you didnt want to talk about your day at work or about mine and that dismaled me pretty seriously but not once you did that all the time i hate you for this for maiming me in such way we never had love we had sex all the time sometimes i thought i was your hooker your personal one you used me all the time you dodgy worthless piece of crap

2527288 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2527289 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2527290 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2527291 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2527292 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2527322 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
2527323 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
2527324 learn the art of patience impatience breeds anxiety fear discouragement and failure patience creates confidence decisiveness and a rational outlook which eventually leads to success
2527325 i cant be seen to be going on leadership training my team might think i dont know how to lead
2527326 i never would have thought that these would be so good in a salad
2527327 should i move all this stuff to a dtp package or does this word processor let me do all that i need to
2527328 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry
2527329 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2527330 we feel our reporting and our investigation have been vindicated
2527331 it took so long because edwards was just so bold in lying about it
2527332 to say the journalists should not consider that is reprehensible journalists can be human beings
2527333 say it aint so elizabeth you knew but supported his run for president
2527334 we had to ride out the storms on our tourbus because we were told that iggy pop trashed the dressing room which was then meant to be ours the night before when he discovered his equipment went missing
2527335 weve been robbed once before in belgium and it sucks so i can totally understand how he must have felt
2527336 we cannot fight terror with laws like these we will form a law stricter than pota when we come to power
2527337 the upa governments actions and its intentions are a matter of suspect for the whole country
2527338 there were some terrorist attacks also while nda was in power but in those incidents the security forces were able to shoot down the terrorists due to high moral today even the forces are demoralised by the government
2527339 let me caution the government to avoid using army against the agitating civilians let me advice them to avoid anything of this sort as it could result in dire consequences
2527340 i did not play my usual game and hit less smash instead i was trying more drop shots the first round match is always tough because you tend to make mistakes early but im happy that everything went according to the script
2527341 i think i adjusted fast to the court conditions breeze and atmosphere here it was wonderful playing in front of such a vociferous crowd
2527342 they are expected to be fit for batting in the second innings
2527343 teams such as germany the netherlands and spain are all quality teams who along with a number of other countries are all capable of winning gold at beijing
2527344 no one wanted to see india out of the olympics but the reality is that the best 12 nations have qualified for beijing
2527345 but i am confident they will come back stronger and ready to take on the world again
2527346 russia is at the moment a party in this conflict not a mediator and that has to be mirrored when ceasefire and peace talks begin
2527347 it is clear that there is no return to the status quo to what was

2527349 this is a war no doubt about it there is no reason to call it anything else
2527350 i have sealed that name of my heir who is 18 years younger than me in an envelope and given it to two persons the name will be disclosed at a opportune time he is not of my family i can say only that much
2527351 we are encouraged by this development and the support provided to infosys
2527352 i wasnt expecting heats to be that fast after seeing the first two heats i wanted to be top seed going into tomorrow
2527353 its going to be a race between three or four of us im looking forward to it
2527354 the approval of the cabinet is incongruous considering that parliament has recently approved amendment to sbi subsidiary banks act 1959 thereby providing for more autonomy to associate banks through appointment of separate chairman for each bank

2527362 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
2527363 i cant tell you how frustrating it is to hear people belittle diabetes because its maintainable everybody on our team is on full alert watching every move nick makes on that stage every single night of his life
2527364 the 12 hottest years in history have all been in the last 13 years
2527365 its not a question of debate what about the medieval warming period the historical record shows they were growing wine in england for goodness sake come on it is not disputed by anyone that the vikings arrived in greenland in ad900 and it was warmer than greenland is now what penny wong is doing is being selective and saying that is a long time ago
2527366 land based temperature readings are corrupted by the urban heat island effect
2527367 urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro climate around the thermometer due to vegetation changes concrete cars and houses
2527368 that doesnt mean you give up on the science and that you cant draw valid conclusions about the nature of earths temperature change
2527369 create a brouhaha and muddy the waters in the climate change story
2527370 all official measures of global temperature show that it peaked in 1998 and has been declining since at least 2002
2527371 and this is in the face of an almost 5 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1998 spot the problem
2527372 the changes in temperature over the past 10 years have basically plateaued
2527373 but scientists did not anticipate a gradual year by year warming in temperature what matters is the long term trend this outcome does not change any of the science but it does change the spin climate deniers can put on it
2527374 in the last 10 years we have seen an increase in carbon dioxide levels yet temperatures are coming down that if anyone looks at the actual data is not disputable carbon dioxide is not driving temperatures because there are other important climatic factors at play
2527375 from a climate standpoint it is far too short a period to have any significance
2527376 what we are seeing now is consistent with our understanding of variability between decades if we hung about for another 30 years and it kept going down then you might start to think there is something we dont understand but the evidence at this point suggests this is not something we should hang around and wait for
2527377 in the last 10 years there has been a catastrophic and massive arctic sea ice retreat weve seen glacial retreat permafrost thaw and ocean thermal expansion so temperature is not the whole story
2527378 it is widely alleged that the science of global warming is settled
2527379 this implies that all the major scientific aspects of climate change are well understood and uncontroversial the allegation is profoundly untrue even the most widely held opinions should never be regarded as an ultimate truth

2527382 how can this be called a harmonious society if its harmonious wed have a right to stay in beijing and attend the olympics
2527383 according to bakus street wisdom the man who really rules azerbaijan is david woodward bps chairman known as the viceroy a walking oil atlas with more than three decades working for the company from scotland to abu dhabi and from alaska to siberia woodward and bp mercilessly spin that btc is the cleanest and safest pipeline ever built georgian peasants and english non governmental organisations beg to differ
2527384 the new government has taken some steps to address abusive practices but these efforts have proven inadequate to stem them moreover some of the governments new law enforcement policies appeared to trigger new allegations of due process violations torture and ill treatment
2527385 russias attitude to proposals made by some politicians that this task pipeline security should actually be delegated to the united states is firmly negative russia will always oppose the presence of any foreign military contingents within the countries of the cis commonwealth of independent states
2527386 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2527387 in the 2000 documentary of that title that brought a new generation of black standup comedy stars to a wider audience
2527388 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2527389 now everyone be telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2527390 we will not report the matter to the anti corruption agency but will forward the problem to the party secretariat for further action
2527391 secretariat being the one announced by umno president recently to
2527392 ironically abdullah ahmad badawi was also a member of team b then
2527393 over the past few weeks i was the least disturbed i wasnt jittery or worried i knew my friends in pas would stick to their principles
2527394 ive known hatta from the early 1990s i was at the human rights ngo suaram and he was an academic at ukm
2527395 tian chua and i have even been cell mates many times back in 1999 and also as recently as january this year we know each other well
2527396 we were involved in organizing the toll price hike demonstrations in early 2007 in fact ronnie and i were both arrested together at one of the demos
2527397 events like bersih have been an important part of learning to coordinate between the three parties
2527398 siti mariahs 20 000 vote majority in kota raja a constituency with only 50 malay votes shows that pas is a beneficiary of the pakatan
2527399 we are equals we recognize our differences but we focus on what we can agree on even if outsiders focus on what could divide us clearly umno wants to spoil the relationship
2527400 the pakatan wasnt born suddenly on march 8th pas and dap for example have tried working together before there has been consensus building and cooperation for decades some successful some not so successful
2527401 theres been a consensus on civil rights whereas the grand ideological debate has been downplayed pas has become more pragmatic voters are more focused in bread and butter issues and the general social setting
2527402 this open debate is a sign of prs inherent strength rather than of fragmentation
2527403 we view an attack on anwar as an attack on the pakatan as a whole
2527404 thats it i have had enough i am going to set up a test that will run for two hours and from those results i will judge who does the better job
2527405 occupies a middle ground between traditional poetry and rap and your ability as a performer is at least as important as your ability as a poet
2527406 its a symbol of friendship and peace its cute and cuddly and sends all the right messages of goodwill
2527407 it may have important results in exacerbating the sino soviet dispute i can see no political objection but you may wish to warn the secretary of state
2527408 it will increase taiwans cultural links with china its a way for beijing to say it cares about the people of taiwan and at the same time remind them that they are also chinese
2527409 there is no magic quite like being right there when a star is born

2527412 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president
2527413 more importantly my children and i not only trust my husband but know that he would never do anything to not only disappoint our family but disappoint the people of america hes a man of great character
2527414 why the presidents legal advisers were so intent on rationalizing the violation of longstanding law in order to adopt an approach coercion that experienced interrogation practitioners agree is not just ineffective but counterproductive
2527415 i love deadlines i like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by
2527416 what you would desire others to do for you you should do for others you should respect others as you want to be respected by them
2527417 it brought tears to my eyes because bernie mac has always been my all time favorite entertainer and comedian it pains me to have to report that
2527418 patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons
2527419 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with senator obama than senator mccain
2527420 i am not an athenian or a greek but a citizen of the world

2527425 i was more thrilled by it than i imagined i would have been
2527426 it just seems incredibly relevant every time i think i cant be prouder of u s olympians those guys find a way to outdo themselves
2527427 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2527428 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2527429 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2527430 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2527431 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2527432 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2527433 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2527434 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2527435 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2527436 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2527437 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2527438 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2527439 but i do support saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2527440 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2527441 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2527442 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2527443 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2527444 to the best of my knowledge this is a random action and not targeted at americans its just that you dont expect something to happen in a country like this
2527445 the chinese government will try not to let this event have a serious impact on u
2527446 im saddened but that doesnt make me think any less of this country
2527447 my feeling is that this has nothing to do with china
2527448 this is clearly an opportunity for some key leaders in china to show their human side
2527449 of course its a little scary but any time you have so many coming together there is a chance that something like this would happen
2527450 im very surprised because all of the locals we have met say its very safe
2527451 china is the friendliest place for americans that ive ever traveled period
2527452 even after this i still feel safer walking down the street in the middle of the night than i do in philadelphia

2527456 the work of the foundation has made possible an avenue of hope and support for many other families facing difficult circumstances of this kind
2527457 through the tragic experience of the delezio family we have been reminded of the vulnerability of our young and our obligation to protect and care for them mr iemma also said
2527458 the money will be put to good use because it provides funding for specialised medical treatment ongoing research outpatient rehabilitation and community education

2527471 lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off
2527472 we havent been told of anything beyond that first statement but i would expect that each team will be updated regarding security
2527473 i believe they had been waiting to get more information we do know it was a lone assailant
2527474 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour

2527490 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2527491 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2527492 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2527493 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2527494 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2527495 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2527497 while there is no question that the defendants have every right to challenge the case and have availed themselves of that right at every opportunity its astounding that the lead paint companies involved in the litigation have the audacity to claim that they are entitled to costs associated with the 100 million defense they mounted and the more than 100 high priced lawyers they used to avoid responsibility for the toxic poisoning of rhode island children

2527503 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
2527504 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2527505 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2527506 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games

2527515 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2527516 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2527517 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy

2527750 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2527751 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2527752 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2527753 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2527755 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2527757 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2527758 its an important pipeline and its also where its being hit these pipeline junctions are a nightmare

2527804 the court finds the memorial at mt soledad including its latin cross communicates the primarily nonreligious messages of military service death and sacrifice
2527805 as such despite its location on public land the memorial is constitutional
2527806 it does not follow the cross has no other meaning or significance
2527807 along with numerous purely secular symbols in an overall context that reinforces its secular message
2527808 it is a 43 foot cross on one of the highest points in san diego

2527816 anyway it turns out that the javacc sic code is messy really really messy but its the source of great amusement though not only from the scary amount of no op casts misleading indenting and undocumented functions but the lexical token for the symbol is monkeys at no we have no idea either
2527817 actually the indentation is consistent if you have your tabs set at 8 spaces where god intended them
2527818 theres a story behind monkeys at and if you know it this little piece of code is a funny inside joke but if you want me to tell you youll have to take back your assertion that javacs code is messy and tell me that its a work of art
2527819 yes it is true when set it to 8 spaces it seems to look a bit

2527827 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet

2527856 our survey reveals a wide gap between the perception homeowners have about their own homes value and the realities of a market in which three quarters of homes declined in value in the past year

2527921 one of the priorities of the ihrc is to address potential threats to human rights that may emerge with developments in communications technology such as in the present case where issues of individual security and privacy are raised

2527930 as required by the courts case law set out in a form accessible to the public any indication of the procedure to be followed for selecting for examination sharing storing and destroying intercepted material
2527931 the strasbourg court has vindicated the iccls belief that data
2527932 this is a landmark case which casts further doubt on the legality of irelands
2527933 the court of human rights has rightly found that greater accessibility and accountability is required to ensure respect for the privacy of thousands of innocent people while secret surveillance is a valuable tool the mechanisms for intercepting our telephone calls and e mails should be as open and accountable as possible and should ensure proportionate use of very wide powers
2527934 i am directed to advise you that the tribunal has no way of knowing in advance of an investigation whether a warrant exists in any given case the tribunal investigates all complaints in accordance with section 7 of the interception of communications act 1985 the 1985 act see paragraphs 16 33 below establishing whether a relevant warrant or relevant certificate exists or had existed and if so whether there has been any contravention of sections 2 to 5 if the tribunal concludes that there has been a contravention of sections 2 to 5 the tribunal may take steps under sections 7 4 5 and 6 in any case where there is found to have been no contravention the tribunal is not empowered to disclose whether or not authorised interception has taken place in such instances complainants are advised only that there has been no contravention of sections 2 to 5 in relation to a relevant warrant or a relevant certificate
2527935 the process of filtering intercepted telephone calls made from the uk to overseas telephones breaches article 8 2 of the convention because it is not in accordance with the law
2527936 the selection criteria in relation to accessing a large quantity of as yet unexamined material obtained pursuant to a s8 4 warrant as indeed in relation to material obtained in relation to a s8 1 warrant are those set out in s5 3 the complainants counsel complains that there is no publicly stated material indicating that a relevant person is satisfied that the accessing of a particular individuals telephone call is proportionate but the respondents submit that there is indeed such publicly stated material namely the provisions of s6 l of the human rights act which requires a public authority to act compatibly with convention rights and thus it is submitted imposes a duty to act proportionately in applying to the material the s5 3 criteria to that duty there is added the existence of seven safeguards listed by the respondents counsel namely 1 the criminal prohibition on unlawful interception 2 the involvement of the secretary of state 3 the guiding role of the joint intelligence committee jic 4 the code of practice 5 the oversight by the interception of communication commissioner whose powers are set out in part iv of the act 6 the availability of proceedings before this tribunal and 7 the oversight by the intelligence and security committee an all party body of nine parliamentarians created by the intelligence services act 1994 it is plain that although in fact the existence of all these safeguards is publicly known it is not part of the requirements for accessibility or foreseeability that the precise details of those safeguards should be published the complainants counsel has pointed out that it appears from the respondents evidence that there are in existence additional operating procedures as would be expected given the requirements that there be the extra safeguards required by s16 of the act and the obligation of the secretary of state to ensure their existence under s15 1 b it is not suggested by the complainants that the nature of those operating procedures be disclosed but that their existence i e something along the lines of what is in the respondents evidence should itself be disclosed in the code of practice we are unpersuaded by this first such a statement in the code of practice namely as to the existence of such procedures would in fact take the matter no further than it already stands by virtue of the words of the statute but in any event the existence of such procedures is only one of the substantial number of safeguards which are known to exist accessibility and foreseeability are satisfied by the knowledge of the criteria and the knowledge of the existence of those multiple safeguards f oreseeability is only expected to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances and the circumstances here are those of national security in this case the legislation is adequate and the guidelines are clear foreseeability does not require that a person who telephones abroad knows that his conversation is going to be intercepted because of the existence of a valid s 8 4 warrant the provisions in this case the right to intercept and access material covered by a s 8 4 warrant and the criteria by reference to which it is exercised are in our judgment sufficiently accessible and foreseeable to be in accordance with law the parameters in which the discretion to conduct interception is carried on by reference to s 5 3 and subject to the safeguards referred to are plain from the face of the statute in this difficult and perilous area of national security taking into account both the necessary narrow approach to article 8 2 and the fact that the burden is placed upon the respondent we are satisfied that the balance is properly struck
2527937 a in the interests of national security b for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime or c for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well being of the united kingdom
2527938 for the purposes of the 1985 act conduct which constitutes or if it took place in the united kingdom would constitute one or more offences shall be regarded as a serious crime if and only if a it involves the use of violence results in substantial financial gain or is conduct by a large number of persons in pursuit of a common purpose or b the offence or one of the offences is an offence for which a person who has attained the age of twenty one and has no previous convictions could reasonably be expected to be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years or more

2527940 a such communications as are sent to or from one or more addresses specified in the warrant being an address or addresses likely to be used for the transmission of communications to or from i one particular person specified or described in the warrant or ii one particular set of premises so specified or described and b such other communications if any as it is necessary to intercept in order to intercept communications falling within paragraph a above
2527941 i such external communications as are described in the warrant and
2527942 3 3 a the secretary of state considers that the examination of communications sent to or from that address is necessary for the purpose of preventing or detecting acts of terrorism and b communications sent to or from that address are included in the certified material only in so far as they are sent within such a period not exceeding three months as is specified in the certificate
2527943 there are a number of differences but the essential differences may be summarised as follows
2527944 1 where the secretary of state issues a warrant he shall unless such arrangements have already been made make such arrangements as he considers necessary for the purpose of securing a that the requirements of subsections 2 and 3 below are satisfied in relation to the intercepted material and b where a certificate is issued in relation to the warrant that so much of the intercepted material as is not certified by the certificate is not read looked at or listened to by any person 2 the requirements of this subsection are satisfied in relation to any intercepted material if each of the following namely a the extent to which the material is disclosed b the number of persons to whom any of the material is disclosed c the extent to which the material is copied and d the number of copies made of any of the material is limited to the minimum that is necessary as mentioned in section 2 2 above 3 the requirements of this subsection are satisfied in relation to any intercepted material if each copy made of any of that material is destroyed as soon as its retention is no longer necessary as mentioned in section 2 2 above
2527945 for the purposes of this section a a warrant is a relevant warrant in relation to an applicant if i the applicant is specified or described in the warrant or ii an address used for the transmission of communications to or from a set of premises in the british islands where the applicant resides or works is so specified b a certificate is a relevant certificate in relation to an applicant if and to the extent that an address used as mentioned in paragraph a ii above is specified in the certificate for the purpose of including communications sent to or from that address in the certified material
2527946 the third major safeguard is provided by the commissioner himself while there is nothing to prevent consultation of the commissioner before a warrant is issued it is not the practice to consult him in advance and such consultation on a routine basis would not be practicable so the commissioners view is largely retrospective to check that warrants have not been issued in contravention of the act and that appropriate procedures were followed to that end i have visited all the warrant issuing departments and agencies named in this report in most cases more than once and discussed at some length the background to the warrant applications i have also discussed the procedure for seeking warrants with officials at various levels in all the initiating bodies and presenting departments i have inspected a significant number of warrants some chosen by me at random some put before me because it was felt that i should see them although i have described a number of instances in which mistakes were made or mishaps occurred i have seen no case in which the statutory restrictions were deliberately evaded or corners knowingly cut a salutary practice has grown up by which the commissioners attention is specifically drawn to any case in which an error or contravention of the act has occurred i accordingly believe that there has been no such case during 1992 of which i am unaware
2527947 necessitated the making of further arrangements by the secretary of state for the safeguarding of material under section 6 of the 1985 act
2527948 some of the written statements of section 6 safeguards which i inspected required to be updated to take account of changes in the public telecommunications market since they had been drafted and approved other statements could as it seemed to me be improved by more explicit rules governing the circumstances and manner in which and the extent to which intercept material could be copied it also seemed to me that it would be advantageous where this was not already done to remind all involved m handling intercept material on a regular basis of the safeguards to which they were subject securing written acknowledgements that the safeguards had been read and understood these suggestions appeared to be readily accepted by the bodies concerned they did not in my view indicate any failure to comply with section 6 of the act
2527949 like my predecessors i have on each of my visits considered and discussed the arrangements made by the secretary of state under section 6 for the purpose of limiting the dissemination and retention of intercepted material to what is necessary within the meaning of section 2
2527950 for the purposes of this act but subject to the following provisions of this section a person intercepts a communication in the course of its transmission by means of a telecommunications system if and only if he a so modifies or interferes with the system or its operation b so monitors transmissions made by means of the system or c so monitors transmissions made by wireless telegraphy to or from apparatus comprised in the system as to make some of all of the contents of the communication available while being transmitted to a person other than the sender or intended recipient of the communication
2527951 an application for a warrant is made to the secretary of state each application a copy of which must be retained by the applicant should contain the following information
2527952 applications for a s 8 4 warrant are addressed in subparagraph 5 2 of the code of practice an application for a warrant is made to the secretary of state each application a copy of which must be retained by the applicant should contain the following information background to the operation in question identical to the first bullet point in 4 2 description of the communications this is materially identical to the third bullet point in 4 1 description of the conduct to be authorised which must be restricted to the interception of external communications or to conduct necessary in order to intercept those external communications where appropriate compare the wording of the fourth bullet in 4 2 the certificate that will regulate examination of intercepted material an explanation of why the interception is considered to be necessary for one or more of the section 5 3 purposes identical to the fifth bullet point in 4 2 a consideration of why the conduct should be authorised by the warrant is proportionate identical to the sixth bullet point in 4 2 a consideration of any unusual degree of collateral intrusion identical to the seventh bullet point in 4 2 where an application is urgent identical to the eighth bullet point in 4 2 an assurance that intercepted material will be read looked at or listened to only so far as it is certified and it meets the conditions of sections 16 2 16 6 of the act an assurance that all material intercepted will be handled in accordance with the safeguards required by sections 15 and 16 of the act these last two bullets of course are the equivalent to the last bullet point in 4 2 by subparagraph 4 8 the s 8 l warrant instrument should include the name or description of the interception subject or of the set of premises in relation to which the interception is to take place and by subparagraph 4 9 there is reference to the schedules required by s 8 2 of the 2000 act the equivalent provision in relation to the format of the s 8 4 warrant in subparagraph 5 9 does not of course identify a particular interception subject or premises but requires inclusion in the warrant of a description of the communications to be intercepted
2527953 1 everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence 2 there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security public safety or the economic well being of the country for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others
2527954 all commercial submarine cables having one terminal in the uk and carrying external commercial communications to europe
2527955 make such arrangements as he considers necessary for the purpose of securing that so much of the intercepted material as is not certified by the certificate is not read looked at or listened to by any person
2527956 disclosure of the arrangements would reveal important information about the methods of interception used it is for this reason that the government is unable to disclose the full detail of the section 6 arrangements for section 3 2 warrants that were in place during the relevant period the methods to which the relevant documents relate for the relevant period remain a central part of the methods which continue to be used therefore disclosure of the arrangements the government assesses and i believe would be contrary to the interests of national security it would enable individuals to adapt their conduct so as to minimise the effectiveness of any interception methods which it might be thought necessary to apply to them further the manuals and instructions setting out the section 6 safeguards and arrangements are in large part not in a form which would be illuminating or readily comprehensible to anyone who had not also undergone the training i have referred to above or had the benefit of detailed explanations they are couched in technical language and refer to specific techniques and processes which cannot be understood simply from the face of the documents they contain detailed instructions precisely in order to ensure that the section 6 arrangements and section 3 2 requirements were fully understood by staff and were fully effective any explanations given by the government of those techniques and processes would compound the problem referred to above of undermining the operational effectiveness of the system and techniques used under the authority of warrants
2527957 the detailed procedures and conditions to be observed do not necessarily have to be incorporated in rules of substantive law
2527958 the admittedly limited extent to which those concerned were made sufficiently aware of their contents
2527959 93 foreseeability in the special context of secret measures of surveillance such as the interception of communications cannot mean that an individual should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly see inter alia leander v sweden judgment of 26 august 1987 series a no 116 p 23 51 however especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret the risks of arbitrariness are evident see inter alia malone cited above p 32 67 huvig cited above pp 54 55 29 and rotaru v romania gc no 28341 95 55 echr 2000 v it is therefore essential to have clear detailed rules on interception of telephone conversations especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated see kopp v switzerland judgment of 25 march 1998 reports 1998 ii pp 542 43 72 and valenzuela contreras v spain judgment of 30 july 1998 reports 1998 v pp 1924 25 46 the domestic law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures see malone ibid kopp cited above p 541 64 huvig cited above pp 54 55 29 and valenzuela contreras ibid 94 moreover since the implementation in practice of measures of secret surveillance of communications is not open to scrutiny by the individuals concerned or the public at large it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive or to a judge to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power consequently the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference see among other authorities malone cited above pp 32 33 68 leander cited above p 23 51 and huvig cited above pp 54 55 29 95 in its case law on secret measures of surveillance the court has developed the following minimum safeguards that should be set out in statute law in order to avoid abuses of power the nature of the offences which may give rise to an interception order a definition of the categories of people liable to have their telephones tapped a limit on the duration of telephone tapping the procedure to be followed for examining using and storing the data obtained the precautions to be taken when communicating the data to other parties and the circumstances in which recordings may or must be erased or the tapes destroyed see inter alia huvig cited above p 56 34 amann cited above 76 valenzuela contreras cited above pp 1924 25 46 and prado bugallo v spain no 58496 00 30 18 february 2003

2528150 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2528151 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2528152 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2528153 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2528155 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2528156 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2528157 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2528414 the reality of book publishing is that there are too few resources to support every book this means that some books will get publicity campaigns and budgets while others will go without additionally most publishing houses are not staffed with enough publicists to mount a full fledged campaign for every book because of this editors must compete with one another to lobby the publisher and the marketing and publicity departments for the funds and staff attention to promote their books
2528415 some aspects of publishing boggle the minds of first time writers thats ok it boggles the minds of many veterans in publishing too for example you might wonder why the big name authors get tons of money spent on their campaigns when their bestseller status would seem to be a foregone conclusion meanwhile a new author could use some of those marketing funds to begin to build a reputation the bald fact is that publishers need to protect their interest in the big authors and spending marketing dollars is one way to keep the author and agent happy the harsher reality is that this dynamic is unlikely to change anytime soon
2528416 the good news is that authors who know how to properly represent themselves to their publishers can find discretionary dollars for book promotion do not count on your agent to make this happen your agent may be terrific but is truly unable to fight every battle on your behalf you will need to become your own advocate with the right efforts at the right time too many authors simply wake up too late to the problem of under promotion an author who can get involved creatively and make allies of the publishing staff can have the most impact on the marketing and publicity program and the best possible chance of reaching a readership

2528420 those watching russian tanks and jets attacking georgian targets in south ossetia and other parts of georgia should remember that it was the eus recognition and support of kosovan independence which triggered this eruption of open warfare putin stated that he would not sit idly by if the eu pressed ahead with its eulex in kosovo and that he would make a military response if they did he said that if the west thought the break up of countries could be initiated then he too would feel able to promote similar secessions to kosovo where russia desired such an outcome the tensions in south ossetia and the deployment of russian peace keepers began in february according to the guardian here and were a direct result of the actions of the eu in kosovo the link has an excellent video news report from an on the ground reporter which i recommend the eu is sufficiently arrogant to go about breaking up serbia in defiance of russia acting as if in the role of a superpower and yet it has no army to back up its political actions the eu not only ignores the democratic decisions of the peoples it purports to rule it is extremely dangerous in another way as it also ignores the strategic realities of the word and doesnt understand that there have to be limits to its power and actions ignoring the views and expressed wishes of its own citizens is one thing but ignoring those who possess military power and have expressed a willingness to use it such as prime minister putin is downright folly folly which has more instant response i dont believe america wants a war with russia and there is no doubt that the eu will be pulling up the white flags in brussels as soon as one shot is fired in georgia the hopelessness of the eu talking big and trying to push russia around in its former territories is now becoming apparent

2528698 you cant say that im desensitized to violence i see movies that disturb me when i see some of the stuff the industry produces the dark knight isnt even comparable to something like battle royale
2528699 which is even harder to swallow when you see the violence is exacted my school kids does batman fight people do fists destroy criminals do people die does the joker slam a pencil through a gangsters eye yes is there blood guts rape is it a snuff film no my viewing the dark knight as a relatively nonviolent film is no reflection on my stance on violence in films sure a lot of my favorite films have violence in them because violence is one of the most cinematic elements that can be incorporated into a movie but again that doesnt mean when its pushed beyond a certain point i dont step back and say wait a minute theres is something wrong there and there is i dont see how you have the right to tell me im desensitized to violence

2528868 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2528869 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2528870 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2528871 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2528872 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2528873 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2528874 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2528875 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2529181 i honestly think anyone making the cut right now has still got a chance
2529182 those going out in the morning with the better greens can post a number and there is no reason why they cant get close to the lead

2529189 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2529190 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2529191 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2529192 the negotiators from the three parties are engaged in consultations as we speak to try and tie loose ends before president mbeki arrives
2529193 all i can say for now is that they are working hard and i suppose things will go well
2529194 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2529195 it is with this in mind that the on going dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean

2529230 am anfang war hier alles sehr schwierig f r mich ich habe versucht mich in englisch zu verst ndigen und weil ich nicht deutsch konnte gab es auch viele missverst ndnisse deshalb habe ich sofort von oktober bis februar einen deutschkurs besucht und eine abschlusspr fung gemacht
2529231 radio ist meine gro e leidenschaft das ist mein leben
2529232 ich war in albanien acht jahre lang als moderatorin und journalistin t tig und zwar bei radio tirana 2 und beim privatsender radio plus 2 ich w rde auch sehr sehr gerne in sterreich als moderatorin arbeiten denn an diesem medium fasziniert mich einfach alles und das wichtigste ist f r mich das publikum das zuh rt und mich auch immer unterst tzt hat die besten gef hle meines lebens habe ich beim moderieren gehabt
2529233 noch ist die zeit f r mich nicht reif in sterreich bei einem radio zu arbeiten da muss ich sprachlich noch viel tun aber ich bin bereit hart daf r zu arbeiten
2529234 mein land ist gr n und blau gr n steht f r die berge und blau f r das meer das bei uns wundersch n ist au erdem sind meine landsleute sehr ehrlich und aufgeschlossen und sie sind u erst gastfreundlich das ist bei uns tradition
2529235 mir fehlen vor allem die freunde hier braucht es viel zeit freunde zu finden es ist nicht so einfach kontakte zu kn pfen wie zuhause
2529236 leoben ist eine sch ne stadt aber die jungen leute unternehmen hier so wenig
2529237 die acht ist zwei mal zwei mal zwei die zwei ist die zahl der symmetrie vier ist die doppelte symmetrie und acht ist dann nochmals eins drauf die symmetrie der symmetrie der symmetrie das ist eine zahl die mit ihrer sch nheit fast ein bisschen angibt ein wenig protzt so wie die k nigin der nacht bei mozart das ist unwiderstehliche sch nheit die schon fast ein wenig furchterregend ist
2529238 irgendwie m chte ich schon gerne wissen wie oft so etwas statistisch vorkommt
2529239 wir sind eingefleischte trofaiacher und m chten nirgend anderswo wohnen wir f hlen uns hier total wohl
2529240 mit sonnenblumen und strohballen und dazu laden wir auch immer verwandte freunde und nachbarn ein
2529241 wir tun uns schwer einen direkten zusammenhang zwischen wetter und besucherzahlen herzustellen
2529242 w hrend wir bei den tagesg sten im ersten halbjahr ein leichtes plus verzeichnen k nnen f llt das plus bei den n chtigungszahlen in unserem 384 betten haus deutlich gr er aus mittlerweile haben wir eine auslastung von ber 70 prozent
2529243 der zenit bei den tagesg sten ist wohl bei allen thermen berschritten
2529244 in den anfangsjahren war die zahl der steirischen thermen noch berschaubar
2529245 gerade der wiener raum ist punkto g sten unsere hauptschlagader der viel besagte verdr ngungswettbewerb hat somit voll eingesetzt

2529251 our love waited 40 years for this day 4 13 1968 6 17 2008
2529252 i changed my last name to roberts in 1975 to make a statement about same sex marriage so weve been fighting this fight for years
2529253 we went to an attorney and said is there anyplace in the world where we can get married he said you pay me and ill check it out he checked all the countries he could find and came back and said basically no he said why dont one of you adopt the other i said no i wont accept that because thats hierarchical and our relationship is equal
2529254 we were very open about our sexuality because we knew that if we were closeted it would destroy us either physically or mentally
2529255 in 1975 we went all the way to the corporate office of ibm about discrimination in the workplace for gays and lesbians we were in milwaukee a very conservative city but as a result of that the next year we were transferred after both being promoted to headquarters located in atlanta as a gay couple it was the first transfer in the history of the corporation treated the same as that of a married couple
2529256 then two years later we were transferred again as a gay couple to san francisco we kept working on this all our careers and finally in the late 90s ibm announced that they would do domestic partner equal benefits so it was a long haul and it cost us professionally but it was well worth it were very proud of the accomplishments that ended up by our work
2529257 we knew that we had to be the best employees that we could be because otherwise they couldve terminated us for non performance
2529258 i think we pissed off a lot of people at ibm but we were exceptional employees for example at one time during my career i think ibm had a total worldwide employee count of 300 000 and at that time i was one of the top seven systems engineers in the united states they couldnt get rid of us so that gave us the opportunity to fight for equal rights
2529259 i have to be careful because there are friend and foe out there
2529260 so i have to be more cautious i wish i could go out there with a ballcap and glasses
2529261 then it felt like you were doing something that you shouldnt be doing but you knew it was right this time we have permission to do it
2529262 i was talking to our leader ohio republican john boehner later in the day and he was as struck with that as i was
2529263 this is reaching the american people whether nbc cbs abc decide to do much with it im not interested
2529264 the new media much of which is gathered around this table and cable television media and talk radio has taken this to the country
2529265 i just think we got to right now focus that enormous energy across the country
2529266 wenn betroffene in manchen ausl nder familien von gesellschaftlicher teilhabe ausgeschlossen werden wenn es zu gewalt und bedrohungen kommt verletzt das oft die menschenw rde und die menschenrechte da wird ja teils eine art versklaverei betrieben
2529267 wir m ssen auch st rker aufzeigen dass es in sterreich verboten ist cousin und cousine zu verheiraten weil die kinder die daraus entstehen mit behinderungen zur welt kommen k nnen das sind kulturdelikte die bisher totgeschwiegen wurden
2529268 es ist teils unbefriedigend dass fremdenrechtliche ma nahmen wie abschiebungen nach negativen bescheiden oder gerichts erkenntnissen nicht sofort passieren sondern wochen oder monate sp ter das sollte schneller gehen
2529269 man sollte nicht in derselben causa zum 4 5 oder 10 mal den gleichen asylantrag stellen d rfen unser system wird hier massiv missbraucht
2529270 ich glaube nicht dass sich das bis oktober ausgeht zuerst muss ein partner identifiziert werden dann muss er eine ordentliche due diligence durchf hren und alle rechtsfragen abkl ren daf r ist die zeit zu knapp
2529271 wenn ich die aua w re w re mein einziges ziel einen partner zu holen der mir etwas bringt ein einstieg der air china br chte vor allem der air china etwas
2529272 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2529273 we wish all the best to everyone here today but the question on the table is one of basic democracy
2529274 theres something special about the union of a husband and wife
2529275 one judge elected george w bush does that bother you

2529277 a falta de envolvimento da sociedade com a escola local seria tema para uma forte cobran a por parte de betinho
2529278 betinho era um otimista e acreditava profundamente nas virtudes das institui es democr ticas
2529279 enorme for a e generosidade cidad no debate e na constru o de uma outra pol tica de seguran a a exemplo do que fez pela reforma agr ria
2529280 os resultados da pesquisa seriam apenas o come o sobre cada dado levantado novas quest es surgiriam de seus desdobramentos
2529281 ele n o se limitava a protestar e a reivindicar medidas mas buscava alertar e chamar a aten o da pr pria sociedade para encontrar novos caminhos poss veis
2529282 ele p de responder e atuar at 1997 e o fez bravamente hoje a tarefa fica com a gente
2529283 we were speechless by the amount of money people are donating the students especially who are very low income
2529284 i feel lucky to be in the right place at the right time and to be surrounded by people from winnipeg
2529285 it gives you the perception there are a lot of good people still and this gives me hope
2529286 almost a thousand of them are waking up every day and not going to school
2529287 they cant go to school a whole generation is just sitting there and not gaining or benefiting from their time there i talked to some of the kids they are innocent they deserve the opportunity for an education and we might start a foundation to help these children
2529288 might not understand the words but they still like the music
2529289 a cosa porta la soppressione dei diritti in modo silenzioso

2529348 governments seeking the benefits of open standards need to consider the role of interoperability while the best implementations may result in formatting problems the worst implementations actually lose information e g information found in pictures footnotes comments tracking changes and tables we consider several implications of these results including the lack of perfect compatibility between implementations the lack of good implementations outside of windows and the surprisingly good overall performance of ooxml implementations

2529366 it is by beholding the glory of christ by faith that we are spiritually edified and built up in this world for as we behold his glory the life and power of faith grow stronger and stronger it is by faith that we grow to love christ so if we desire strong faith and powerful love which give us rest peace and satisfaction we must seek them diligently beholding the glory of christ by faith in this duty i desire to live and to die on christs glory i would fix all my thoughts and desires and the more i see of the glory of christ the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and i will be more and more crucified to this world it will become to me like something dead and putrid impossible for me to enjoy

2529383 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2529384 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2529385 i am hopeful that lord manor b amp b will indeed become a gay destination spot to come and tie the knot in a tasteful way
2529386 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2529387 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2529388 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2529389 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2529390 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2529391 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2529392 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2529393 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2529394 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2529395 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

2529400 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2529401 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

2529410 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2529411 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2529412 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2529413 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2529414 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2529415 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2529416 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2529417 to begin with his trial violated two of the most fundamental principles accepted by the criminal justice systems of all civilized nations the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence and the prohibition on retroactive criminal laws unfortunately hamdan will have served his entire sentence before a non military court ever hears these arguments perversely most of his 66 month sentence has already been served the father of two small children has been in gitmo for 61 months

2529421 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2529422 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2529423 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2529424 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2529425 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2529426 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2529427 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2529428 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2529429 durante a minha perman ncia aqui quero expressar as profundas preocupa es da am rica quanto liberdade e aos direitos humanos na china
2529430 esta visita veio reafirmar a minha convic o de que os homens e mulheres que aspiram poder exprimir se de acordo com a sua consci ncia e a prestar culto ao seu deus n o constituem uma amea a ao futuro da china s o eles que far o da china um grande pa s no s culo xxi
2529431 a am rica tem falado aberta e com constantemente das nossas preocupa es com o comportamento do governo chin s temos claro que para alcan ar o seu pleno potencial a china tem de confiar no seu povo e conceder lhe de mais liberdade
2529432 apenas a china pode decidir o rumo que ir seguir mas estou optimista quanto s perspectivas
2529433 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2529434 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2529435 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2529436 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2529437 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2529438 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2529439 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2529440 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2529441 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2529442 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2529443 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2529444 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2529445 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2529446 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2529447 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2529448 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2529449 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2529450 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2529451 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2529452 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2529454 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2529455 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2529456 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2529457 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2529458 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2529459 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2529460 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2529461 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2529462 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2529463 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2529464 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2529465 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2529466 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2529467 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2529468 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2529469 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2529470 the negotiators from the three parties are engaged in consultations as we speak to try and tie loose ends before president mbeki arrives
2529471 all i can say for now is that they are working hard and i suppose things will go well
2529472 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2529473 it is with this in mind that the on going dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean
2529474 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week
2529475 however a less hawkish statement on policy from the fomc federal open market committee on august 5 combined with sharply declining energy prices provided a powerful lift for dow jones industrials last week despite generally weak economic reports

2529673 its not so good for sport or for gymnastics with judges making decisions not by result but according to some kind of game
2529674 im gonna get myself in a lot of trouble with his remarks
2529675 but its been like this forever it hasnt changed countries have certain friends and friends help friends i dont know what message was sent to the judges in between sessions but i think were a better team
2529676 if you dont have an athlete here you cannot have a judge here
2529677 i know i dont look it but im 26 your body starts to tell you
2529678 eleven months ago i was given this challenge that seemed impossible and today i was out there competing in the olympic games representing canada and being a part of an incredible team
2529679 this is something i worked for for 20 years of my life and for these 11 months i had to search for small victories every single day you dont get that by winning a gold medal and i know that its not the final moment that defines the person its everything you have to go through to get there and for me the past 11 months especially have been so rich and taught me so much about myself and about the strength that i had and it felt phenomenal
2529680 its black and blue i told him dont be disappointed you contributed in ways you dont even know you pushed me made me push myself made everyone push themselves
2529681 it was very gutsy of him to go there and put it all on the line
2529682 im very proud of brandon he showed a lot of strength of character
2529683 brandon probably ruptured his lateral ligament complex and as well he had tendons that are snapping back and forth
2529684 he was probably an 8 or 9 on every landing
2529685 have this opportunity taken away from him when he had the potential for a podium position hes devastated
2529686 especially brandon pushing super hard to do anything he could just to get out there it was amazing to see him it was just insane i have no idea how he was able to pull it together
2529687 i think were unlucky not to have beaten china in that game
2529688 i dont know what the results are but pretty much it should guarantee us a quarter final berth and to be in a group of teams thats so tough and be guaranteed the quarter finals that feels pretty good
2529689 i honestly if the whole ball has to go over the line i think i did part of the ball did go over whether it was the whole ball i dont know they say one camera showed it was over and another didnt ill go with it didnt
2529690 we watched the sweden china game and knew what it would be like
2529691 its kind of funny because a lot of us thought we kept hearing canada whenever they were chanting china
2529692 i think this was one of the top performances i have ever seen from a focus angle and from a technical discipline
2529693 also we seemed to be by far the fitter team out there and that surprised me a little bit the thing i wasnt happy with was that we didnt score on our chances but we created a lot of them

2529777 they have you in a holding arena where you just sit there with 300 other countries and hang out obviously the best part is walking into the stadium thats the biggest rush
2529778 but theyre l o n g its a long process i think we left the hotel at 5 30 and didnt get back until 1 30 in the morning it kind of throws your schedule off
2529779 the press we ran at tennessee the 1 2 1 1 we run that here too
2529780 candace is used to being on the top of that and catch is used to being in the interceptor role our man to man full court pressure is also very similar
2529781 in the first quarter when there was that lull candace was huge in shadowing the ball getting steals and helping us pick up the tempo catch was the same way
2529782 sometimes in games you have to ease your way it but 13 2 is not easing your way in
2529783 its a good feeling we know we can call time out and regain our poise
2529784 i think our greatest strength right now is were 12 deep and can bring in players to bring you more energy kara and catch especially did that the minute they stepped on the floor
2529785 were picking up on defense so much more than we have in the past
2529786 and players know its 3 4 5 hard minutes and then youre out
2529787 quando vestii la maglia della fiorentina per la prima volta nel 2003 la squadra era nata da poco e n io n quagliarella in precedenza ci siamo integrati al meglio per me stato difficile prosegue lex terzino del torino perch giocavo fuori ruolo e col tecnico cavasin non avevo un grande feeling per questo mi sento uno dei nuovi mi sembra un vero e proprio esordio in maglia viola con la fiorentina inizio una nuova parte della mia carriera
2529788 me ne sono pentito ma in estate ho fatto di tutto per tornare
2529789 gli dissi di no quando era il ds del lecce ma una sua chiamata non si pu rifiutare due volte
2529790 il suo modulo esalta le mie caratteristiche sono convinto che con lui far il salto di qualit definitivo
2529791 osvaldo mi ha sorpreso in queste settimane quello che ha fatto meglio di tutti e giovane sono sicuro che diventer un grande giocatore
2529792 sto bene ho reagito in maniera positiva allamichevole giocata contro la primavera e stato un test importante considerato che mi sono operato solo quattro mesi fa per il mio recupero sottolinea lex giocatore granata devo ringraziare in particolar modo il professor mariani e lo staff viola che in questi giorni ha fatto quasi dei miracoli per riportarmi in forma
2529793 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week
2529794 however a less hawkish statement on policy from the fomc federal open market committee on august 5 combined with sharply declining energy prices provided a powerful lift for dow jones industrials last week despite generally weak economic reports
2529795 barring a physical disruption that may temporarily spike prices we judge that oil prices have peaked for the next few years
2529796 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2529797 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2529798 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2529799 is it profitable is it viable is this a business proposition when business propositions have got us into a bit of a mess theres got to be other ways of discourse and the awful thing is because religion has been so sidelined in so many areas now people no longer have that vocabulary to talk with and so if you have an environment problem you can talk about it in terms of economics because people have got that vocabulary those words or politics because people have got those words if you talk about it in terms of responsibility or religion people dont know the words and if people dont know the words youve got nothing to talk with and so this discourse this element of discourse this dimension is completely missing because people dont know that the ideas are there
2529800 if there are no moral restraints upon the use of knowledge well look what weve got and the interesting thing is that this is sold to the world as enlightenment and liberation ha

2529803 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2529804 its going to be a race between three or four of us tomorrow night and im looking forward to it or tomorrow morning i should say
2529805 its going to be a tough one but im sure going to give him a run for his money
2529806 i do get a little bit jittery thinking about it
2529807 it was definitely on my mind a little bit it cant not be
2529808 to come back and swim a smart race im really happy with it
2529809 i dont want to be in lane four given to the fastest swimmer
2529810 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2529811 its always great to get the first race over and done with
2529812 but a few things went wrong there and still going in fastest qualifier for the semifinal its great to know that i have something to improve on
2529813 obviously having the heats at night shakes things up a little bit i know i have more than that in me
2529814 i didnt want to take any chances with the last heat going all best times leaving me out in the dust im going to have a double shot espresso tomorrow morning and ill be ready
2529815 i knew it would be quick but not quite that quick
2529816 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2529817 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2529818 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2529819 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2529820 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2529821 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2529822 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2529823 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2529824 i cannot teach anybody anything i can only make them think
2529825 the national enquirer is not well regarded as a news source by the news media
2529826 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2529827 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
2529828 i think the mainstream news media were responsible for not airing it and not printing it earlier there really wasnt anything to report
2529829 if the story were false it would be a tremendously hurtful thing for his family and professionally lethal to him
2529830 the whole truth nothing but the truth so help me mac
2529831 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2529832 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2529833 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama

2529837 we didnt underestimate them because they are a good team that has been together for a few years
2529838 we missed two really good scoring opportunities and that cost us
2529839 once they scored they made us chase shadows and made us look like a new team which we are
2529840 we had seven players making their debut and it showed it is not a crisis losing after one game
2529841 i felt we played well and im pleased with the way we adapted to our first game in the championship
2529842 it was a challenge for our players coming to play against a team that were in the premier league last season
2529843 the players have showed that they are up for the challenge and now we have to maintain it
2529844 postponing or freezing the tax on homes worth over a million pounds probably wouldnt deter many buyers but for owners of an average priced home it could make a major difference to the overall cost
2529845 we know that the upfront costs in other areas dwarf what stamp duty asks for and in many cases we know that many first time buyers around the country pay no stamp duty at all

2529867 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2529868 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2529869 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2529870 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2529871 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2529872 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2529873 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2529874 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2529875 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2529876 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2529877 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2529878 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2529879 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2529880 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2529881 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2529882 as far as we are concerned we are willing for a seat sharing formula with congress all over the country
2529883 the obstacles created by jammu and kashmir in the amarnath pilgrimage land allotment is not their own the decision of cancelling land allotment to the sasb taken by the governor of jammu and kashmir is not his own he has just carried out the orders of new delhi there should be no confusion about that and we will continue our struggle against the double standards adopted by government
2529884 i am confident that the revered amarnath shrine board will get back the land and i want to assure the people of jammu that the bjp will extend its full support to the sass in its campaign for the land across the country
2529885 other political leaders said they would also not like to be part of the delegation if we had to be out but we persuaded them that it is a good opportunity to talk to the samiti leaders and it should not be lost
2529886 we told them other members of the delegation that it does not matter whether or not we are in the delegation talks must be held with the samiti as dialogue and discussion is preferable to ease the situation
2529887 i wonder if they all are sharing the same suck it loop
2529888 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2529889 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2529890 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2529891 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2529892 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2529893 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2529894 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2529895 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2529896 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2529897 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2529898 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2529899 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2529900 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2529901 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2529902 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2529903 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2529904 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2529905 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2529906 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2529907 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2529908 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2529909 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2529910 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2529911 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2529912 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2529913 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2529914 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2529915 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2529916 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2529917 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2529918 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2529919 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2529920 consequence of economic growth and development untendered by adequate concern and conservation
2529921 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2529922 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2529923 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2529924 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2529925 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2529926 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2529927 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2529928 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2529929 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2529930 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2529931 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2529932 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2529933 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2529934 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2529935 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2529936 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2529937 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2529938 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2529939 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand

2529943 ive heard about the bus scam in thailand cambodia the tea scam in china the kashmiri houseboat scam in india this is my first visit to xyz are there any scams or tips and tricks i should be aware of thanks for your help
2529944 are you afraid of us and you seem scared if you dont want us spend time with us you dont have to we just want to practice our english
2529945 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2529946 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2529947 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2529948 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2529949 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2529950 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2529951 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2529952 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2529953 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2529954 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2529955 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2529956 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2529957 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2529958 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2529959 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2529960 just so you all know we did set a record
2529961 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2529962 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2529963 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2529964 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2529965 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2529966 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2529967 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2529968 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2529969 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2529970 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2529971 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2529972 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2529973 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2529974 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2529975 in every life there is one particular event that is decisive for the entire person for his fate his convictions his passions
2529976 where had all that russian generosity gone it had been replaced by political consciousness
2529977 for not having seen it all nor remembered it all for not having divined all of it
2529978 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2529979 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2529980 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2529981 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2529982 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2529983 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2529984 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2529985 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
