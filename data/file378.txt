3780017 one reason china is able to continue producing so cheaply is that the rights and safety of its workers are ignored in addition china buys raw materials from countries with abysmal human rights records
3780018 many assume that chinas cost advantage in manufacturing comes from cheap labor but in chinas burgeoning steel industry our research suggests massive government energy subsidies not other factors keep prices down

3780051 this year has not been normal because of the internally displaced persons who took refuge in the province and also due to unfavourable climatic conditions that adversely affected our food crops
3780052 our projection for this year is that we are likely to require nearly double the relief food rations 150 000 bags of maize and 60 000 bags of beans to see us through
3780053 some of these areas have to make do with relief food until the next crop
3780054 indeed there is need for an emop emergency operation assessment to help identify the actual needs on the ground
3780055 the short rains maize crop has been harvested yields were low and expected to drop by 75 per cent bean yields are very low and are expected to drop by over 90 per cent
3780056 currently 60 percent of the farming households are depending on the markets for their food items
3780057 farm input prices especially fertilisers have also risen dramatically in price and with the long rains planting season being over many farmers reduced on the rates or completely avoided their usage and this will greatly hamper food security this year

3780100 communism destroyed the not just the social class or social classes but it destroyed the creative energies of an entire people it drove them underground it brutalized them it destroyed them to the point where they could not produce the same titanic figures that had just come onto the world stage before the advent of communism

3780110 over time these trends could play out in several different ways with different effects on peoples lives
3780111 applications like twitter or mig33 a mobile based social network service rely on the ubiquity of mobile phones
3780112 infotech advances are also enabling more involuntary transparency as seen by the 45 of us parents who use internet monitoring software to track their kids online activity
3780113 since users are never out of touch with their friends coworkers and or peers their activities and locations can be tracked indeed many services market their transparency features as a selling point
3780114 when the story of michael vicks dog fighting business came out the general public was given a glimpse of the sadistic world of dog fighting
3780115 they were horrified to learn that dog fighters not only force these animals to fight to the death many also engage in violence against the dogs by means of electrocution strangulation kicking and other unimaginable acts of cruelty the public had known there were evil people out there who trained dogs to fight but it took a big media event to take the barbaric practice of dog fighting to the forefront of their consciousness
3780116 in a sense the vick case was a blessing in the fact that its brought this issue to light that this is happening in our society
3780117 people are learning about the cruelty many pit bulls are forced to endure and more people are turning in suspected dog fighting operations we cant let this issue fall out of the public eye and thats why we are thrilled to partner with andrei the pit bull arlovski
3780118 in the coming weeks andrei will begin working very closely with for pits sake and the knock out dog fighting program and getting all of the interested arlovski com members involved as well

3780135 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him
3780136 he sent a personal message asking her to get on board he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters she believes he is going to be the first black american president and she is honored to be a part of that

3780139 my compliments on a superb and extremely helpful web site to the best of my knowledge its only one of its kind that provides so much detailed information in one place for the clean air conscious traveler as a business editor for a florida daily newspaper i know quality of life and particularly air quality are critical factors for many high tech companies when they are scouting for locations to expand or start a new enterprise your site and links provide an outstanding portal into this expanding field of clean air consciousness keep up the excellent work
3780140 your site is outstanding and very informative i live here in la and have been hoping to one day find an area with cleaner air in particular i had been looking at bellingham and enjoyed reading of your experiences there your writing style is excellent and a real pleasure to read of the many sites out there a truly useful site looking forward to reading about your next journey towards finding a clean air location
3780141 i came across your blog and found your site to be a very interesting read thanks for what you do to bring clean healthy air issues to light
3780142 your blog on the clean air and your trip to the monterey peninsula is wonderfully written bravo to you on a fine piece of writing and with great photos
3780143 if the problem were called atmosphere cancer or pollution death
3780144 the entire conversation would be framed in a different way
3780145 the weather makers the history and future impact of climate change
3780146 if scientists were predicting the imminent return of the ice age
3780147 im certain our response would be more robust global warming creates an illusion of a comfortable warm future that is deeply appealing for we are an essentially tropical species that has spread into all the corners of the globe and cold has long been our greatest enemy
3780148 climatic change are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming
3780149 the phrase climate change is growing in preferred use to global warming
3780150 because it helps convey that there are changes in addition to rising temperatures
3780151 why is this brand called the global warming catastrophe such a weak brand
3780152 the waste stream from society is being turned around and providing energy and transportation fuel for the society
3780153 now its a question of developing the market proving the technology and getting the cost down
3780154 and we may end up pursuing something along those lines
3780155 part of why the state is involved is to assure open access
3780156 were at a prime location right off the freeway an excellent location for people looking for near access

3780160 outstanding post its great to read about your success and how youve made it happen im going to
3780161 great points well presented i agree with you i did a post on october 12th that presented five
3780162 okay stop distracting me im trying to work here and i cant do it while laughing so hard
3780163 i too would prefer to hear from practioners and peers whether in person or remote if the
3780164 the truth is that ignoring race is not an option for obama nor is simply changing the subject
3780165 obama has to make the country comfortable with the most unusual profile of any person ever to come within spitting distance of occupying the white house while at the same time preventing the election from becoming a race consumed by race
3780166 the past wasnt forgotten or forgiven so much as put aside while people got on with their lives and their business
3780167 15 to 20 percent of democrats or democratic leaning independents
3780168 he who ate my bread has lifted up his heel against me
3780169 this is what jesus did yet i am experiencing it first hand in a muslim home completely cut off from the gospel
3780170 even my close friend in whom i trusted who ate my bread has lifted up his heel against me
3780171 i do not speak of all of you i know the ones i have chosen but it is that the scripture may be fulfilled he who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me john 13 18
3780172 the person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and an ally not a 20 percent traitor
3780173 im not sure that the politics and the people in the mountain west have changed as much as the politicians have changed right look at the crop of democrats running now theyre pretty different from what you saw 10 or 15 years ago right look at montana governor brian schweitzer or arizona governor jan napolitano or me or colorado governor bill ritter we are much more pro business we dont have problems with guns
3780174 when pixar started there was no cg industry so we were in manufacturing
3780175 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
3780176 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
3780177 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
3780178 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
3780179 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
3780180 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
3780181 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
3780182 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
3780183 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
3780184 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
3780185 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
3780186 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
3780187 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
3780188 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
3780189 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
3780190 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
3780191 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
3780192 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
3780193 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
3780194 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
3780195 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
3780196 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
3780197 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
3780198 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
3780199 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
3780200 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
3780201 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
3780202 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
3780203 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
3780204 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
3780205 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
3780206 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
3780207 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential
3780208 what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything
3780209 corporations are conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3780210 the global livestock business is among the most damaging sectors to the earths increasingly scarce water resources
3780211 these slums are filled with the unemployed and disaffected africas cities are becoming a powder keg of instability and discontent
3780212 we are deeply concerned that the steep rise in global food prices coupled with availability problems in a number of developing countries is threatening global food security
3780213 securing world food security may be one of the biggest challenges we face in this century
3780214 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3780215 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place
3780216 today every farmer is in debt and despair vast stretches of land have become water logged desert
3780217 prince charles has got a way of getting things absolutely wrong
3780218 its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them out of hand
3780219 in some developing countries where for instance there is a problem with drought or salinity if you can develop salt or drought resistant crops there are great benefits
3780220 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3780221 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3780222 condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa
3780223 the reality is that without the development of science in farming we would not be able to feed a tenth of the world population which will exceed nine billion by 2050
3780224 if we go down this path i think we will put this country at risk there could be a period of great difficulty in the next 10 or 20 years
3780225 no evidence has emerged from the first round of gm crops of any public benefits they have actually increased pesticide use in the farms that have used them
3780226 theres no evidence of any health problems to human being talk of that has disappeared there was a great deal of excitement in america a few years ago that some butterfly was going to disappear due to use of gm foods this butterfly i understand is still flapping around quite happily
3780227 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout off about something which he has clearly got wrong scientists and others who have looked at the problem have found no solid evidence that gm crops affect peoples health
3780228 we have to move to a more sustainable agriculture and reduce emissions

3780668 i have wanted to bring a free screening clinic to tri city athletes for the past few years earlier this spring i had the opportunity to participate in a clinic in the seattle area and since then i have worked to get one pulled together for our community
3780669 hcm kills silently which is so tragic young athletes in their prime should not have to face this type of risk when a simple screening can give them the information they need to manage their health
3780670 i appreciate the opportunity for our kids as well as others from around the area to get screened sports physicals are great but this goes beyond and gives both the kids and parents more knowledge about a condition that can be so serious

3780694 martha jones ex time traveller and now working as a doctor for a un task force has been called to cern the worlds largest particle physics laboratory in geneva where theyre about to activate the large hadron collider lhc
3780695 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france once activated the collider will fire beams of protons together recreating conditions a billionth of a second after the big bang and potentially allowing the human race a greater insight into what the universe is made of
3780696 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
3780697 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
3780698 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3780699 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3780700 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3780701 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3780702 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3780703 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3780704 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3780705 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes

3780714 with more cars on our roads increasing levels of congestion and rising emissions it is time for us all to look at our travel behaviour
3780715 we need to look at new ways of persuading people out of their cars and onto more sustainable forms of travel such as trains buses walking and cycling

3780724 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby
3780725 and now the baby was having a baby i was shocked a little bit it was mind boggling
3780726 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3780727 if were serious about getting a million of these out there the possibility that it will have a serious impact on the election is real the more people that see a nobama sticker on a car the better the chance that people will realize that this electing obama is not inevitable
3780728 do you miss your parents since youre just living alone and your parents are not staying here

3780785 it would have been really simple for them to just say pay the interest ive given up the supreme court

3780791 we are concerned about the not full stadiums said wang wei executive vice president and secretary general for the beijing organizing committee

3780803 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3780804 weve seen from past games experience that each host country and its cultures has differing appreciations for the various sports which means some venues are packed others not so giselle davies an ioc spokeswoman said in an e mail
3780805 as regards beijing for the venues that arent full the organizers are working on how to offer students and others the chance to see and learn about the sports
3780806 cheering from beijing workers inscribed on them in english and mandarin sat in the scorching sun in the outfield bleachers which were otherwise largely empty

3780808 our company sends us to softball today but other workers were sent to other venues to do some work we come here on shifts
3780809 olympics go go go china go go go beijing go go go
3780810 the volunteers are assigned to cheer for both sides in order to provide good atmosphere the responsibility rests with the venue managers if they find there are not enough people too many empty seats they should organize some cheerleaders

3780826 your position was not hidden from me but i was fearful that it would be made obligatory upon you and then youwould become unable to continue establishing it
3780827 i went out with umar to the masjid during one night of ramadaan and the people were divided
3780828 i see that if i bring together these people and make them all one congregation led by one person that would be better
3780829 allahs messenger never exceeded eleven rakaat in ramadaan or during other months for the night prayer bukhaaree
3780830 when the prophet prayed with the people one night during ramadaan he prayed eight rakaat and then made witr
3780831 umar lbn al khataab ordered ubay ibn kaab and tameeman ad daarie to establish eleven rakaat with the people the reciter used to recite hundreds of verses and we used to lean on our sticks because of their long standing and we did not leave until the beginning of fajr

3780837 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
3780838 so how do you feel today are you coughing feverous achey huh huh huh
3780839 now just put your feet in the stirrups and scoot on down this way
3780840 i found that i would select the cube when left clicking on it in object mode if the
3780841 when you want the cursor back into the cube just select the camera with rmb put the cursor into the cube following the steps above and re select the cube with rmb
3780842 ive discovered it helps a lot if you are in object mode and not in edit mode i wrote the following before discovering this
3780843 i failed at this until i had zoomed in close enough to the cube when i was too far zoomed out i kept selecting the cube rather than creating an edit point
3780844 i had the same problem and found it was because the cube was selected i made sure i was in object mode right clicked on the camera to select the camera instead of the cube and i could then position the edit point in the cube however doing this messed up the next part of the tutorial because you cannot switch into edit mode with the camera selected perhaps the suggestion of trying to put the 3d cursor in the cube should be dropped as it raises too many questions at this stage
3780845 you can deselect all by pressing the akey or the select button in the 3d view
3780846 use wireframe mode works better to get the cursor in
3780847 to get it back in the cube 1 make sure youre in object mode 2 select the cube 3 object gt snap gt cursor to selection cursor refers to the 3d cursor here so it puts it right in the middle of the cube
3780848 i think its an essential point to note that in order to place the cursor inside the cube the cube must not be selected akey was probably the best way to deselect the object
3780849 ctrl z does undo but blender doesnt seem to store nearly so many previous actions i think its only one or two
3780850 if i remember correctly undo history gets cleared when you switch between object and edit mode
3780851 i wasted a lot of time here thank you to the reader who suggested on the 3d view header object gt snap gt cursor to selection it was the only thing that worked to get the cursor visible again and placed where clicked
3780852 you can set the number of steps the undo command can do as mentioned in earlier pages
3780853 so i can move the 3d cursor but what if i want to put it back in its original spot
3780854 how do we work in a virtual 3d environment through a 2d screen
3780855 not really no although the guy ive written the book with gavin baddeley is a highly ordained high priest of the church of satan you know when marilyn monroe was a member of the church of satan she used to have a pink and black painted baphomet pendant so i find all this too american for my liking i prefer crowley just because its more english and i can relate to it more than to anton lavey
3780856 no no i certainly dont think he was writing or mumbling he got to the very depth of it and was very intelligent and he might have possibly believed that he had several guardian angels and spirits talking to him and teaching him various things for the book of the law actually a lot of this is written about in our book the gospel of filth we have a huge amount on crowley and the church of satan including an interview with zeena lavey and a very rare interview with anton lavey which was transcribed shortly before his death
3780857 i love books i love working on the computer i love e books i love to have a library full of interesting books theres something about books you know you can hold them breathe them in

3780946 a josu erkoreka no le neg que ese acuerdo con pp rechazara un final dialogado de la violencia
3780947 haber una garant a para que nadie pueda valerse en la ambig edad de que no ha habido un pronunciamiento sobre el final definitivo de la violencia y ma ana sale una escisi n pasado ma ana no s qu organizaci n
3780948 tiene que haber un pronunciamiento de final definitivo de la violencia por parte de eta y dentro de ese fen meno adyacente al terrorismo tiene que haber un final dialogado que no tiene que contemplar objetivos pol ticos
3780949 alguna informaci n podemos tener tambi n el pnv de que hay un malestar dentro de ese mundo en el que se llega a la reflexi n de si hay presos de primera y de presos de segunda en la medida en que hay una directriz de no abonar fianzas para salir en libertad condicional y sin embago hay quien sale en libertad condicional mediante el pago de fianza sobre si retomando experiencias anteriores hay una contestaci n tambi n a la v a de la pr ctica de la violencia

3780961 mit zw lf prozent haben wir eine der h chsten ausl nderquoten aller deutschen fl chenl nder und ber 1 4 millionen der etwa sechs millionen hessen haben einen migrationshintergrund daher ist hessen ist auf eine gelungene integration angewiesen sie ist erforderlich f r die teilhabe jedes einzelnen mitb rgers in der gesellschaft und am arbeitsmarkt sie ist wichtig f r ein friedliches zusammenleben in unserem land
3780962 der beirat hat bereits in den vergangenen jahren erfolgreich zur besseren eingliederung der in hessen lebenden zuwanderer beigetragen aus dem integrationsbeirat ist deshalb eine feste einrichtung geworden seine arbeit ist ein wichtiger bestandteil des hessischen integrationskonzepts unser modell des institutionalisierten dialogs wurde von anderen bundesl ndern zum vorbild genommen auch f r den integrationsgipfel auf bundesebene war hessen damit vorreiter
3780963 wir gedenken heute der opfer die an der deutsch deutschen grenze ihr leben lassen mussten und wir denken an den bau der berliner mauer als das symbol der unfreiheit und unterdr ckung der mauerbau steht f r schie befehl stasi und hunderte von todesopfern der deutschen teilung die nur eines wollten in freiheit leben die mauer steht symbolisch f r eine wirtschafts und gesellschaftsordnung die die eigenen menschen einmauern musste weil zigtausende in den freien westen gelaufen waren umso weniger kann ich heute verstehen dass es menschen gibt die diese traurige geschichte nicht wahrnehmen wollen
3780964 es gibt keinen repr sentanten der linkspartei so herrmann der das wort
3780965 wir d rfen nicht akzeptieren dass solche linksradikalen gesellschaftsf hig gemacht werden es sind die ideologischen erben des ddr unrechtregimes
3780966 eine kritische und ehrliche aufarbeitung der ddr geschichte bedeutet eine klare distanzierung vom linksextremismus
3780967 die extremistische ausrichtung vieler mitglieder der linkspartei ist nicht l nderspezifisch die spd schadet der demokratie ebenso wie sich selbst wenn sie sich nicht unmissverst ndlich von der linkspartei distanziert

3780986 we decided to bring our granddaughter for the fun here tonight its amazing shes had a ball
3780987 a detailed review of the process to effect the change was undertaken following the review of the appropriate sections of the municipal act and in consultation with the countys solicitor it was determined that under section 219 3 any change in the term of the head of council cannot come into effect until following the next regular municipal election in reviewing the requirement under section 219 3 it is suspected that at the time that the new municipal act was drafted that consideration was not given to changing the term of warden during a term of council it is understandable that after a municipal election the term of an elected official not be changed without a further election as that in effect disenfranchises the public it is also understandable that the term of head of council appointed by council not change without a further election however with the desire of county council to change the term effective at the next election for head of council no one is disenfranchised and the members have an opportunity to elect the person they wished to lead county council
3780988 thats 1 000 tons of waste per month that we wont have to put in the landfill

3780993 we will be seeing fewer bags of garbage heading to the landfill

3781009 wir f hlen uns durch die anh rung in unserem anliegen unterst tzt und werden den gesetzentwurf z gig weiter beraten unser ziel bleibt es noch in diesem jahr zu einer verabschiedung des gesetzes zu kommen m glicherweise schon in einer der n chsten plenarsitzungen
3781010 der gesch ftsf hrende verkehrsminister rhiel plant mit seiner heutigen bundesratsinitiative dem ausbau der schienen und wasserwege notwendige investitionsmittel zu entziehen damit wird ein staufreies hessen noch viel mehr zu utopie wer die vorhandenen stra en erhalten will sollte stattdessen daf r sorgen dass sich alle verursacher von sch den an den kosten beteiligen und alternativen zur stra enbenutzung in ausreichendem ma e zur verf gung stehen
3781011 allein durch eine moderate anhebung der lkw maut die ausweitung der maut auf busse und leichte lkw ab 3 5 tonnen sowie die ausweitung der maut auf bundesstra en k nnten j hrliche mehreinnahmen von 2 5 milliarden euro erzielt werden gerade beim schienennetz besteht aufgrund jahrelanger vernachl ssigung ein enormer investitionsbedarf nur durch die ausweitung der kapazit t und beseitigung von langsamfahrstellen kann aber die notwendige verkehrsverlagerung von der stra e auf die schiene gelingen mehr g ter auf schiene und binnenschiff bedeuten gleichzeitig weniger lkw verkehr auf unseren stra en und damit deutlich geringere instandhaltungskosten

3781020 die netto einnahmen aus der maut m ssen in voller h he der verkehrsinfrastrukturfinanzierungsgesellschaft vifg zugewiesen werden nur so kann die substanz durch eine verstetigte finanzierung erhalten werden es ist zeit zum handeln denn der schlechte zustand vieler autobahnen und bundesstra en ist f r die verkehrsteilnehmer nicht l nger hinnehmbar
3781021 diese grunds tzliche weichenstellung muss zuerst vorgenommen werden und hessen lehnt die vom bundesverkehrsminister beabsichtigte mauterh hung ab
3781022 die l nder sind get uscht worden allen zusagen und versprechungen des bundesverkehrsministeriums bei der lkw mauteinf hrung zum trotz steht heute nicht mehr geld f r die stra en zur verf gung die zus tzlichen einnahmen durch die maut sind im haushalt untergegangen
3781023 und dies obwohl wir seit 2005 j hrliche netto mauteinnahmen zwischen 2 5 und 3 5 milliarden euro haben
3781024 die berfahrt eines 40 tonnen lasters beansprucht die stra e genauso stark wie die berfahrt von 40 000 pkw da ist es doch nur logisch und auch dringend erforderlich die lkw maut zweckgebunden f r die erhaltung der stra en zu verwenden weil der bund dies nicht freiwillig tut und weil deshalb sein verm gen sichtbar schaden nimmt muss eine stetige finanzierung gesetzlich festgeschrieben werden
3781025 das entspricht einer 1 000 kilometer langen autobahn mit je 2 fahrstreifen je richtung das ist l nger als die strecke von flensburg nach kempten im allg u noch schlimmer ist es um weitere 1 000 kilometer autobahn fahrstreifen bestellt dort sind geschwindigkeits oder gewichtsbeschr nkungen ausgeschildert weil l cher absenkungen und spurrinnen in der fahrbahndecke sind

3781306 it gives me an advantage because most safeties cant see over the line and even when im backpedaling i can see most stuff over the line
3781307 i also have a big wing span so i can get my hand on the ball and stuff like that
3781308 when i got to high school i was actually a running back i wasnt this tall i asked myself what i liked more there were too many people at running back and there werent that many at safety
3781309 i also liked kenny phillips who plays for the giants now i looked up to him and i was like i want to be like him
3781310 doc was recruited me at florida and then he left pittsburgh was recruiting me at the same time the coach at florida told me if this person doesnt commit then they would have a scholarship for me i felt like they really didnt want me so ill go to pitt then
3781311 doc called me up after my visit from pitt and he told me he was at west virginia and they wanted me there as a mountaineer he got me on a visit i came up here and i liked it they showed me a lot of film and i liked the defense
3781312 they run around a lot and they do a lot of different stuff you are never in one spot theyre always disguising stuff
3781313 it let me know that i have the opportunity to get on the field because there are three positions that i can learn to play
3781314 my whole mindset when i came in here was just to work get into the film and get these plays down
3781315 i know the plays somewhat but its not to where i can just run around and not worry about should i do this should i do that i didnt come here big headed i came here knowing that i have to work and when its my turn to be on the field ive got to be ready
3781316 he has really progressed and hes a smart kid and a great athlete were really pleased with him he has a lot of ability but hes going to make a lot of mistakes as a young guy but were really pleased with him after our 10th or 11th practice everyday he makes plays and monday he was running with the ones and the twos
3781317 im not going to say im fully ready because there is lots of room for improvement but right now im looking good
3781318 ive made a couple of mental mistakes because i didnt get back far enough in high school i was back far enough but in college youve got to get back even farther because theyve got some big arms out there
3781319 my coaches have always emphasized that since im tall ive got to get my hips down
3781320 they are constantly training me to be ready to break on the ball dont be high hat when i tackle make sure im low and drive my feet being tall is unique but it also has its advantages too
3781321 its hard for anybody if you dont get your shoulders over your knees and your knees over your feet
3781322 if you dont do that then of course its going to be a problem for anybody i figure if i get the technique down it will be fine for me

3781327 the experience of giancarlo is invaluable to me and adrian has lots of talent i think he is improving race by race becoming more consistent
3781328 more importantly they have a great attitude that will help me to face the challenges of tomorrow and i think they will be very satisfied driving the 2009 car which i personally am sure will be a significant improvement and a big surprise

3781345 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3781346 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3781347 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3781348 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3781349 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3781350 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3781351 the watchwords for this new version of itx have been flexibility in a wide variety of scenarios and broadcasting environments together with the powerful new capabilities for very demanding operations requested by our larger broadcast customers

3781354 going from a cripple to an olympic athlete in four days
3781355 it was a pretty tremendous effort for him to come out and do what he did
3781356 i gave it everything i had i have to be happy with that
3781357 not bad but not great no medals a lot of hard work
3781358 with everything thats gone on in the last two months on crutches for four days after the tour and not riding to be here and vying for the medals is not a bad effort
3781359 i wouldve been kicking myself if id come good and i wasnt that far off the medals so in that respect its not bad
3781360 i felt as soon as you go over your limit early on you pay for it later so i rode quite conservatively from the start for that reason
3781361 they all got up here and theyre all in the stands today so that was fantastic
3781362 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time i have nothing to say im speechless
3781363 i just keeping thinking wow thinking that im the greatest olympian of all time its a pretty great title
3781364 going into the 150m turn and the finish i couldnt see the wall
3781365 my goggles were getting more and more full of water throughout the race i just hoped i was coming first i was kind of upset it happened and thats why i ripped those goggles off pretty quickly at the end
3781366 when my goggles filled there was nothing i could do i could just swim
3781367 i tried to see something at the finish at the 150m wall i tried to see the t on the bottom to judge my turn i was more or less trying to count my strokes hoping i was dead on
3781368 im disappointed i know i can go faster than that he was aiming for 1 51 but i handled the situation the best way i could
3781369 but i would probably like to take back what i said on rugby union
3781370 my future is still up in the air i could stay i could not ive put them contract talks off until the end of the year you never know
3781371 i could sign up tomorrow i could sign up next year i could be with the storm i could not be
3781372 i could stay in league i could go at the end of the day its a business and you have to do the right thing for your future and whats best for you
3781373 thats the political side of football everyone is talking everyone has their opinion on the game at the moment
3781374 my advice is not to worry about it just get back to supporting your club and the players
3781375 no one is sitting around and talking about rugby league itself i grew up watching the game i would watch my old man plan and then run home to watch the 4 oclock game
3781376 it probably disappoints players people around the players are talking about it their friends are talking about it
3781377 i dont think i have become more of a leader
3781378 but i sit back and see whats going on in rugby league today and i think if you have an opinion express it if you dont be quiet
3781379 as a role model i talk to them about the consequences of what they do
3781380 sell your property in 7 days or less for full market value
3781381 i dont think you can possibly point to one factor
3781382 the suits are the easy thing to point at but i think the impact of that was gone by mid year 31 world records were set leading into the games now the progress is coming because there are so many people pushing and pushing each other just look at the number of countries winning medals 15
3781383 the big thing they saw in melbourne was phelps underwater work
3781384 hes the leader in that they call it the fifth stroke now theres freestyle breaststroke backstroke butter and underwater we have seen enormous improvement from our guys in it
3781385 a dvd will look better on a low end television than an analog broadcast antenna signal will look on a high end hdtv that is because the quality of the digital signal sent to the analog set is far superior to the analog signal sent to the digital hdtv
3781386 i dare say matthew will probably go through to the end of the season now
3781387 i think if you see the kid in his performances the competitiveness in him as a big man is already at afl level
3781388 there are some parts of his game that he cant sustain but overall he just has that hunger and drive he is a very competitive young man and i think you will see that he will just grit his teeth and push on
3781389 maybe he might not have the dominance of small men but maybe that is like the brownlow medal
3781390 first year kid playing in the ruck pinch hitting in the ruck at times i think he is not getting the ground time of some of the others so when you look at his 12 possessions or 14 possessions it is fantastic
3781391 i think it is a tough gig for a young man to play in a big mans role at a young age when their body is growing they are still developing they are giving away weight experience the whole lot i think it is a harder gig
3781392 he has been a really good player for them so it will be interesting to see the two big blokes and petries form has been outstanding especially over the last month when he has been close to the kangaroos best player so it will be interesting to see if he does return
3781393 he was pretty close to being right to play last week but there was just about a 25 per cent chance of re doing that hamstring and we just thought he just doesnt need to do a hamstring late in the season
3781394 that would be season over so for one week to miss out he should be right to come in
3781395 i wasnt sure how i would go if i wasnt 100 per cent fit and it got me down a little bit i was frustrated that i had trained so hard and wasnt 100 per cent
3781396 i am really happy with how i pulled through its just going to make me stronger
3781397 i hope to feel a little bit better for the relay and then i am finished and i can get as sick as i want
3781398 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure

3781403 dragons ceo peter doust is pleased to have boyd and costigan joining the club next year
3781404 being able to re join wayne next year will be great
3781405 ive got a lot of respect for him so it will be good to be back together at the dragons
3781406 neville has proven that he is a player that can play at the highest level
3781407 he has returned from a long injury and we are hopeful he can recapture some of his best form when he joins the dragons next season
3781408 its good to be heading home and taking on the broncos again
3781409 many folks have been very busy in the off season accomplishing a long list of improvements to the stadium
3781410 many thanks go to the office of physical plant numerous consultants and contractors feedback from our loyal nittany lion club members and staff from intercollegiate athletics and other partner organizations at penn state
3781411 we realized we needed more space we needed better access for our patient
3781412 we needed more to be able to do what we needed to do treatment wise for our patients this is not an emergency room but its meant to handle emergencies that would occur in the stadium and at least try to stabilize the patient for transport minor injuries breathing problems dehydration heat nausea vomiting anything like that well see here a lot of those patients get released and they go back to the game or well advise them to go home or follow up at the hospital

3781417 we just had to knock that meeting over and get it out of the way and not have any skeletons in the closet going into the next game
3781418 we really had a crack in the first 15 to 20 minutes not to say we didnt have a crack over the 80 minutes
3781419 we were really in there with a chance against the blacks and they just put us away and started building points and momentum and they are a very hard team to stop
3781420 we were really into it we started well but they were the better team on the night
3781421 our execution didnt help us thats something weve got to rectify we worked on it this morning and well keep working on it
3781422 they smashed the argies a 63 9 win against argentina last saturday who they did play in the semi final of the 2007 world cup it just shows how far they have come since then
3781423 they are going to be a tough ask over there as they always are
3781424 they get big crowd support very daunting to go into a test match over there
3781425 its the same thing as auckland i guess its just another ground but they really love getting into you before you get over there and saying they are the best and everything else
3781426 well be right we just have to concentrate on what we are doing and hopefully well come up with the goods
3781427 rocky elsom is likely to be available for selection in the second week as is ashley cooper

3781430 lote has had a niggly knee he trained well today and it hasnt deteriorated
3781431 there was some contemplation of an arthroscopy or a clean up for him but he is positive if thats his mindset and his outlook then thats fine by us
3781432 there may be a requirement down the track to get a clean up well just respond week to week
3781433 i am coming at the iccs request to give my personal experiences to the new zealand and australian players and officials
3781434 i will be telling them why i live in lahore and why i think it is safe i wouldnt be living there if i didnt think it was safe i will be letting them know my straightforward and earnest views
3781435 as the global broadcast and production partner of the icc espn star sports is committed to produce and broadcast champions trophy in a manner that is truly engaging and entertaining to fans across the globe
3781436 we are very hopeful that the icc shall decisively deal with any issues around the event to ensure full and committed participation of all the teams in the most safe and secure environment in order to put up a premier event for the benefit of fans across the globe and for the game of cricket
3781437 the world of cricket is facing issues that need to be resolved with the participation of all stakeholders in the sport including the icc as crickets international governing body and its various members
3781438 as iccs global television production and broadcast partner our primary concern is the continued premier status of various icc tournaments which we are keen to preserve because an overcrowded schedule may result in negatively affecting existing as well as new cricket tournaments and fixtures
3781439 representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3781440 the results of those meetings will then be fed back to me and also to the icc vice president sharad pawar and icc chief executive haroon lorgat on august 20 so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
3781441 even if they say yes now i dont think we have enough time to prepare for the series and complete the logistical details

3781449 my message is that i give all my strength here im fighting for you as you are fighting there i feel very georgian today
3781450 my first thought was to support them after all their families are there because of this situation i feel more georgian
3781451 i dont want this to be a war between us

3781460 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3781461 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3781462 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3781463 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3781464 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3781465 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama

3781472 have you ever been to a concert in the park

3781484 yes i loved it i thought it was so touching especially at the end but i was really impressed when lydia told me how she thought the ending could have been different id love to hear her talk more about that
3781485 there is a long list of disciplines associated with this important building
3781486 it is fascinating to note for example that the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence will co exist with the centre of peace and conflict studies providing hope for us all
3781487 it is fitting that the staff and students involved should have an appropriate home but the building being opened today also helps to demonstrate the international role that is played by the university of st andrews

3781490 im genuinely sorry to know of all the difficulties you have had in your past but you cannot tackle these or cure them by embarking on criminal behaviour
3781491 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3781492 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3781493 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3781494 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3781495 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3781496 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3781497 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3781498 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3781499 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3781500 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3781501 the roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3781502 why the extreme leftism of an obama presidency would leave the united states weakened diminished and divided why obama must be defeated and how he can be
3781503 this book is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited written by an individual who was discredited after he wrote a similar book to help and vice president dick cheney get re elected four years ago
3781504 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign
3781505 usable in numerous elastomeric applications including interior and exterior vehicle parts roofing asphalt and any other applications

3781507 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3781508 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3781509 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time

3781513 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3781514 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3781515 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3781552 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
3781553 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
3781554 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
3781555 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
3781556 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3781557 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
3781558 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
3781559 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
3781560 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3781561 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3781562 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire

3781581 its a vortex manipulator the red eye flight of time travel hops through rips in the fabric of time in the least leisurely manner possible
3781582 as if the tardis is a luxury cruise compared to that

3781586 yes well it was my tune ups over the years that made her what she is today and that is what counts ergo i am correct as always
3781587 the tardis can do everything that crackerjack vortex manipulator can do ill be much happier once we ditch the blasted thing into the nearest black hole
3781588 you mean unlike the last time where you gave it to a time agent to cover a pub bill
3781589 under the circumstances it was the right thing to do
3781590 besides it was worthless the tardis is capable of the same short hops as that bracelet i gave captain harkness when shes feeling up to the job

3781606 i think i swam it in one meet and got like ninth place after that i said im never swimming this again
3781607 we started by juggling handkerchiefs and scarves and then we moved up to beanbags and tennis balls i can do softballs but i dont try doing anything crazy im scared to do anything like plates maybe i could try bowling pins i would like that

3781610 i would definitely want to do swimming because i used to do it and like to watch it
3781611 i think what michael phelps is doing is incredible to have a goal like that is pretty awesome i dont know if i could swim 17 races and eat like 10 000 calories a day as softball players if we did that wed all be 500 pounds because we dont have two workouts a day like swimmers do i also would like to do rhythmic gymnastics i think its interesting and synchronized swimming we traveled with them and i was thinking about how these girls never touch the ground and they have to throw themselves in the air its the craziest thing in the world you wouldnt look at them and think they were olympic athletes but knowing what they do i think its incredible you have to be an athlete to tread water for that long and then do all that stuff in the air

3781716 instead of serving his district john kline has served george w bush and the corporate interests that fund his campaigns the only things historic about his recent trips to washington are the lengths hes gone to to convince voters hes working for them in reality hes working hard to distract from a record no politician trying to get re elected this year would want

3781723 la bbc trasmette anche puntate di top gear sui suoi canali televisivi internazionali come bbc world gli episodi sono accorciati rispetto alla lunghezza originaria che di unora a 30 minuti lasciando spesso in sospeso dei riferimenti e creando perci delle inconsistenze in aggiunta qualche volta la scaletta originaria non viene rispettata cos che i riferimenti a degli eventi non ancora andati in onda sono comuni lunico spezzone girato espressamente per la versione internazionale alla fine di ogni episodio quando clarkson saluta i telespettatori di bbc world invece che quelli della bbc

3781736 we are targeting pickups suvs and the really big market

3781750 uncertainty is hitting closer to home with millions of people feeling that theyre living on the economic edge its not just peoples bank accounts that are being depleted their mental emotional and physical resources are being exhausted too whether its the lack of certainty about our home our health our financial stability or our personal safety it starts to eat away at our basic sense of security and well being
3781751 we need to be on the lookout for overcare an emotional habit that people commonly resort to when things are feeling unstable people can think that if theyre not worrying or obsessing over a person situation or outcome it must mean theyre not caring enough the need to worry or obsess is really just a mental and emotional habit it is possible to find an inner peace and security during stressful circumstances the stronger our foundation of inner security the more resilient we are the quicker we can recover from overcare and feelings of worry stress and anxiety and the less well drain our precious inner resources
3781752 overcare is often disguised as angst worry concern sympathy or even sentiment and can lead to stress related health issues such as headaches backaches high blood pressure digestive issues and hormonal imbalances although both men and women can experience overcare and related physical complaints our society tends to train and expect women to be caregivers so they tend to be more prone to overcaring about people or situations

3781764 when the story of michael vicks dog fighting business came out the general public was given a glimpse of the sadistic world of dog fighting
3781765 they were horrified to learn that dog fighters not only force these animals to fight to the death many also engage in violence against the dogs by means of electrocution strangulation kicking and other unimaginable acts of cruelty the public had known there were evil people out there who trained dogs to fight but it took a big media event to take the barbaric practice of dog fighting to the forefront of their consciousness
3781766 in a sense the vick case was a blessing in the fact that its brought this issue to light that this is happening in our society
3781767 people are learning about the cruelty many pit bulls are forced to endure and more people are turning in suspected dog fighting operations we cant let this issue fall out of the public eye and thats why we are thrilled to partner with andrei the pit bull arlovski
3781768 in the coming weeks andrei will begin working very closely with for pits sake and the knock out dog fighting program and getting all of the interested arlovski com members involved as well

3781778 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3781779 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3781780 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3781781 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3781782 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3781783 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad

3781807 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3781808 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

3781835 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3781836 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3781837 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3781838 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3781839 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3781840 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3781843 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3781844 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3781845 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3781870 the downside risk to our growth expectations in 2008 09 is primarily from a further deterioration in global conditions with its attendant impact on india be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
3781871 the downward revision in the panels gdp growth outlook to 7 7 percent in fy09 is in line with our view that growth will moderate this year
3781872 however we expect the slowdown to spread from industrial to the services sector and therefore have a lower gdp forecast of 7 3 percent

3781874 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3781875 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3781876 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3781877 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3781878 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3781879 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3781880 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3781881 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3781882 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3781883 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3781884 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this

3781892 will undoubtedly seek to terminate or erode first americans underwriting relationship with the mercury subsidiaries and terminate other first american companies business relationships with the mercury companies in favor of fidelitys own companies offerings
3781893 the bottom line is that first american in providing mercury nearly 100 million of financing over this decade bargained for and obtained the rights to approve and reject any mercury proposals to sell significant assets
3781894 acquire any business entities wind up liquidate or dissolve its affairs or enter into any transaction of merger or consolidations
3781895 sell lease or otherwise dispose of all or any significant part of its property or assets without the written consent
3781896 mercury ceased making preferred stock dividend payments it defaulted on its promissory notes and its operating subsidiaries breached their obligations to remit premiums
3781897 if fidelitys deal remains in place it will be immediately performed the colorado operations will be integrated into fidelity and it will be impossible to unscramble the egg
3781898 were due to its own unrepentant greed and not to any wrongful action by mercury
3781899 but first american repeatedly refused to pay even a small percentage
3781900 millions of dollars more than the best offer made by first american
3781901 found itself without working capital numerous checks and wire transfers bounced and mercury did not know how it would meet its obligations or conduct business in the immediate term
3781902 the circumstances were analogous to a run on the bank
3781903 mr kennedy agreed to pursue a transaction along these lines
3781904 minutes after receipt of first americans predatory offer we called a fidelity representative for the purpose of exploring preliminary interest in acquiring the colorado businesses

3781911 i schedule all events that will utilize the network for training
3781912 the biggest challenge is just getting the big picture put together as far as who is actually going to be playing and execution time
3781913 if he does not perform his scheduling job correctly an exercise may not be able to go off because if they are already overscheduled on a circuit then they cant play the exercise fails and people are not being trained

3781960 that doesnt alter the fact they have a penis and the only way to keep spaces rape crisis centers in this case cq free of biological males is to make them only for those who are assigned female at birth because otherwise we have to let in anyone who identifies as a woman which includes people with penises
3781961 they can go to a trans rape victim help center but im curious why do you imagine this is womens problem whats up with trans sense of entitlement to womens time and scant resources and sense of entitlement to be taken care of by women theyre not arent entitled to a damn thing from women
3781962 what i want to know is why why why are some transwomen so desperate to enter women only spaces im not talking about the womens loos quite frankly i dont care one way or the other because i spend loads of time hanging around bars where the ladies loos are always full of drag queens i mean rape crisis centres safe spaces for women
3781963 our customers will benefit tremendously from the refurbishment work that mitie will be carrying out in bracknell homes will be brighter safer and more appealing with facilities that are modern and updated
3781964 mities work will also be helping us to meet and maintain the decent homes standard an important milestone for all social housing providers as well as our own bracknell forest standard which exceeds the governments requirement
3781965 we work with social housing providers across the country and we understand that having a new kitchen or bathroom can make a huge difference for their customers
3781966 improving peoples lives is a strong focus of our work and by bringing homes up to a decent standard were helping to create places that people can be proud of
3781967 bound to be the case that theres a quarter or two of negative growth
3781968 there are two sides to todays figures the welcome news is that the numbers on incapacity benefits and lone parent benefit continue to fall as our reforms kick in and more people who were written off before now having the chance to join the high numbers in work
3781969 the disappointing news is the increase in unemployment but there is considerable help available to people through jobcentre plus there are over 600 000 vacancies available at the moment the majority of people losing one job are into another in less than three months
3781970 despite this months rise in unemployment there are still 380 000 more people in work than a year ago
3781971 the figures are a tragedy and hide the misery for tens of thousands of households where people lose their jobs
3781972 we have been warning for months about a downturn in the economy and i fear there are more job losses to come particularly in food manufacturing where thousands of workers are being made redundant
3781973 it is inevitable absolutely inevitable that as peoples living standards fall they will look to compensate through higher wage demands they will have no option
3781974 this is a really striking jump in unemployment and is an extremely worrying development given the current economic slowdown i hope this is not a sign that there will now be a continued rapid rise in unemployment
3781975 gordon brown and his ministers need to explain what they can do to stop this trend continuing
3781976 as the british economy slows down perhaps heading towards recession there is bound to be a serious impact on jobs
3781977 ministers have been totally complacent in insisting they have found a permanent solution to the problem of boom and bust in the economy
3781978 the government needs to move quickly to make sure people who lose their jobs dont face the double disaster of losing their homes as well
3781979 this is the weakest set of labour market data since the economic slowdown began employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions of the country while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum
3781980 with the unemployment rate claimant count and level of redundancies all rising workers will expect the government and the bank of england to take decisive action to stop unemployment growing further still
3781981 unions are looking for action to boost demand we urge the bank to cut interest rates and the government to take the cap off public sector wage increases
3781982 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3781983 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3781984 the banks inflation report and the latest jobless figures confirm that business conditions are getting tougher the economy is losing momentum but with inflation set to rise to 5 or more in the short term there is little room for interest rate cuts in the immediate future
3781985 the outlook should start to look better next year provided the impact of higher energy and food prices is contained and not passed through in to the broad economy in the form of sustained inflation that will require a period of wage restraint across the economy and a painful squeeze on living standards the alternative would involve a serious risk of higher interest rates and unemployment over the slightly longer term
3781986 mervyn king has given us a frank assessment of britains economic prospects in marked contrast to the tired mantra from gordon brown that britain is well prepared for the economic downturn
3781987 as both the government and the bank of england have recognised the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high energy and food prices
3781988 we know the impact that this is having on people here and will continue to support families and business through these tougher times
3781989 employment remains near record highs interest rates are historically low and the past decade of rising incomes and job creation puts us in a much stronger position than in previous decades
3781990 the government stands behind the 2 inflation target and will continue to support the banks decisions to ensure inflation comes back to target

3781998 er ist grunds tzlich nicht verpflichtet einen sondermarkt f r restwertaufk ufer im internet in anspruch zu nehmen auch kann er vom sch diger nicht auf einen h heren restwerterl s verwiesen werden
3781999 es hat den anschein dass haftpflichtversicherer derartige regressprozesse nutzen um sachverst ndige unter druck zu setzen sachverst ndige sollen dazu bewegt werden in ihren gutachten h here restwerte aufzunehmen damit diese h heren restwerte der versicherungswirtschaft zugute kommen
3782000 ich habe selbst schon erlebt dass gesch digte direkt von der unfallstelle zu mir auf den hof gefahren sind und noch w hrend der besichtigung hat bei dem gesch digten das handy geklingelt dran war die versicherung die versucht hat den schaden zu steuern sprich den gesch digten dazu zu berreden in eine vertrauenswerkstatt der versicherung zu gehen und sich nicht selbst zu entscheiden wo er das fahrzeug reparieren lassen m chte
3782001 falls am fahrzeug ein totalschaden eingetreten sein sollte weisen wir bereits jetzt darauf hin dass wir die h he des zu erzielenden restwerts in jedem fall einer konkreten pr fung unterziehen werden wir bitten daher von einer ver u erung des verunfallten fahrzeugs zun chst abzusehen
3782002 es kommt immer darauf an ob der gesch digte darauf eingeht oder nicht nat rlich kann man den versicherer nicht daran hindern den gesch digten anzurufen und hilfestellung anzubieten allerdings muss der gesch digte nicht darauf eingehen er hat das recht sich zun chst anwaltlich beraten zu lassen das kann man jedem gesch digten auch nur empfehlen das zu tun und nicht von der versicherung berrumpeln zu lassen

3782004 im afraid the stress was more than he could bear
3782005 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3782006 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3782007 one morning he called and asked me to meet him in town i said youre supposed to be on a flight right now and he said im not going he called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me
3782008 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3782009 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex sometimes we would go to his house or we would fool around in his truck just driving around and then parking
3782010 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3782011 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture

3782019 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration
3782020 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3782021 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not
3782022 i would say that we mostly were focused elsewhere unlike during the cold war when wed see a single soviet armor battalion move so yes the size and scope of the russian move has come as something of a surprise
3782023 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3782024 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3782025 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis

3782027 but the question is how do we best give home schoolers the freedom to teach their kids while making sure that children actually do get an education and give those children some access to outsiders so that we know theyre ok should the legislature officially legalize home schools but also invoke some light regulations like home visits or requiring some evidence that the children have been learning or do we figure that these cases are so rare we should just let it go
3782028 getting projects approved isnt rocket science but youd be surprised how often it ignores all the fundamentals

3782034 ive done cookies and theyre edible theyll actually cook up as if you put them in the oven
3782035 they brown up and everything on a little metal tray and youll actually have a meal when you come back ive done bacon which is really disgusting and it actually cooked it crispy and also ive done eggs frying an egg is not a problem
3782036 id say most drivers are not aware of it if its hot they might crack the window a little bit or leave their sun roof open a little bit but i think thats where it ends
3782037 think about anything you might leave in your car like lipstick or cds weve seen cds actually melt while in the radio
3782038 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
3782039 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
3782040 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon

3782063 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3782064 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3782065 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3782066 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3782067 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3782068 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3782069 i think not im terribly sorry its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long

3782073 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
3782074 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out

3782097 no one will say it out loud but the lack of uptake in honours maths in ireland is due to teacher performance
3782098 the teaching of maths is the single most important factor in a childs education and the fact of the matter is the education system cannot surpass beyond the quality of its teachers
3782099 talk of the maths failure rate being an international problem is a cop out
3782100 we have the potential to improve the interest in maths science and engineering but were not creative enough to take the right steps
3782101 this is a real economic issue for ireland in terms of companies that rely on students coming out of engineering and computer courses we are asleep when it comes to maths and we are just hitting the snooze button when maths points are brought up were just not getting out of bed on the issue and this could be disastrous for the economy
3782102 maths is the language of the knowledge economy we have to address teacher performance a whole series of steps are needed but it requires bravery at the department of education and science
3782103 some of these people only have to do a module as part of one year at teacher training college to be qualified to teach honours maths we have to acknowledge the fact that honours maths requires special treatment
3782104 all technology companies are finding it hard to get irish talent smes are finding it hard and they are competing against organisations like google intel and ibm if an organisation has 20 polish it engineers in a high cost location like dublin surely someone in head office is going to be asking why dont they have an office in a lower cost location like poland this is potentially a very serious issue for the economy and no one seems brave enough to take the steps that need taking
3782105 there is still resistance from young people to engineering and science training in schools and colleges and there continues to be an ongoing shying away from these so called hard subjects
3782106 it is the governments responsibility to foster the countrys economic interests and a key element of this is an education system that equips students to face the modern world and solve the challenges of today and the future
3782107 maths has been a cause for concern for some time and obviously the 12pc failure rate is disappointing the government is aware reform is needed at second level as there is not adequate understanding of mathematical concepts
3782108 we aim to ensure this changes by introducing project maths in 24 schools this september which is a new concept to bring about a cultural change in the teaching of maths

3782169 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3782170 this research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3782171 lung cancer has been the poor relation for too long and we need to work with the media to bring attention to advances in research treatment and services for people with the disease
3782172 the media has the power to increase awareness and inform people about lung cancer and in doing so become an informed voice for a group that has been clearly overlooked for many years

3782197 board certified general surgeon currently splitting time between providing locum tenens surgical coverage in new hampshire and vermont and working as a consultant at cambridge management group which specializes in physician physician and physician administrator communication issues i am a recovering academic surgeon who is passionate about helping physicians nurses hospital leaders and board members work together
3782198 as a general surgeon who trained at the harvard surgical service affiliated with the new england deaconess hospital i did not face the humiliation that others have decried
3782199 caring for surgical patients with teams is a long and proud tradition that continues to this day with surgeons thanking the nurses and anesthesiologist at the end of the procedure
3782200 i know that i will be drowned out by the voices of many others who feel that they have been abused i do not deny that surgery has abusive people i just wanted to say that my memories remain full of the camaraderie of taking care of patients under trying circumstances such as multiple admissions long nights and weekends and dynamically changing physiology
3782201 i confess to being a fan of maggie mahars health beat posts in health care spending the basics spending on physicians services do we spend too much part ii she detailed meticulously what lies behind the 22 of the 2 1 million spent last year on physician services i agree with her that income disparities between general practitioners and invasive cardiologists radiologists and some surgical specialties need to be resolved many contracting decisions about physician compensation seem arbitrary and capricious to me

3782206 in a specialty that would be labeled procedural my father took a history performed a physical examination interpreted laboratory tests and brain scans in conjunction with colleagues made a diagnosis and derived a treatment plan in conjunction with the patient and family

3782487 in a whole range of african countries where there are factional fightings there are paramilitaries operating all over and serious violations of human rights by everybody the u n peacekeepers have also been tempted and fallen prey to this utterly unacceptable standard of behavior
3782488 i certainly can speak for the indian army with my just under 40 years in uniform
3782489 when you have such large numbers deployed in such circumstances not that im condoning it but theyre really aberrations one must take note of it and make sure that theyre severely dealt with
3782490 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3782491 it is a reaction to bajaur and other operations and if these are not stopped then we will launch more attacks
3782492 you cannot imagine what atrocities the government is committing against innocent women and children
3782493 imagine what this world would be like today with total american influence
3782494 the remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic georgian villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
3782495 imagine what this world would be like today with total american influence
3782496 a convoy of russian tanks left gori but is not heading to tbilisi
3782497 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3782498 unfortunately we are forced to restate the very fact that the principal agreement reached on the ceasefire and the return of the armed formations to the places of their permanent dislocation is being permanently violated by the russian federation
3782499 despite the assurances from the georgian side that they have ended all military activities russian troops shot down a second georgian drone over tskhinvali earlier today
3782500 the tanks just rolled past us with their guns at the ready definitely looking like they were ready to engage
3782501 its the same scenes as we were seeing at the beginning of the conflict as far as the people here are concerned the politicians may be talking about peace but theres really no sign of it here
3782502 truce was signed to withdraw russian troops and withdraw georgian troops what about the ossetian and abkazian separatists

3782505 you name any of the things that make you a human being and they have all been stripped away
3782506 in my worst moments i think that we might be way too late
3782507 they have been jerked from pillar to post theyve ended up in one concentration camp after another
3782508 it probably means annihilation of black communities but there are some people who will say to you that they are pretty well annihilated already
3782509 were only on the edge of what weve done to these people we have ripped away everything language culture land self esteem
3782510 you name any of the things that make you a human being and they have all been stripped away
3782511 the domination exhibited by physicians particularly surgeons is about far more than verbal abuse and yelling
3782512 i happen to have just been in the or a couple of weeks ago with my wife who was undergoing an emergency c section
3782513 but heres the thing as far as they were concerned they were the center of the universe and everything in that room revolved around them
3782514 but all that was a minor annoyance to me and i would not have commented on it except for the following the nurses quite clearly lived in fear of the doctors
3782515 then rather than make sure to get the physicians attention the nurses keep counting
3782516 so the nurses go counting again and again meanwhile the physicians are busy sewing up my wife they are probably half way done when finally a nurse summons the courage to speak up and say a sponge is missing
3782517 what im not ok with is that the nurses are afraid to speak up and correct physicians even when it is essential to their job one nurse finally overcame her fear this time but i am not confident that it will happen every time at that hospital
3782518 i look back and wonder why i didnt say anything

3782530 the hard working middle class family doesnt read them theyre looking for solutions on fuel prices health care bringing our valiant troops home from iraq and saving social security in this race only paul kanjorski has offered answers to those dire problems weve got barletta on the run and that will be more evident in the next few days
3782531 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
3782532 i think stowe s completely right when he says that we ll move to an entirely new platform for blogging and rss and email and calendars and and and one that embraces the flow versus trying to silo it it is one of those big problems that i m so fond of and one that i hope defrag can contribute to solving
3782533 the original ethos of the blogosphere was focused on supporting community principally through the interaction on blog comments and later on through trackbacks that has been the face of blogging until quite recently when rss and then flow applications facebook twitter friendfeed etc began to strip mine the myriad communities within the comment space
3782534 the blog authors have no means to pull all the threads back together and even if they did there is no certainty that the participants would care to cross talk with other fragmented communities although i would welcome such tools if they existed
3782535 the flow fragmentation is starting to resemble the linguistic barriers we have long had on the web except now it is not a segregation based on language but based on tool selection it reminds me of the divided world that still exists in instant messaging
3782536 imagine that i might sign up for a future flow based blogging tool it would yes create static pages for blog posts for those stuck in the web of pages model but those that choose to follow me a la twitter or tumbler would receive my posts in their own account or to extend the model within any number of third party apps perhaps as a client on the desktop imagine an extended version of twhirl for example where i could receive tumbler or any other generated posts in between the tweets note that the future tumbler account might not even support comments at all it would be just a tool to generate posts and to toss them into the flow
3782537 in this model everything has become disconnected everything is principally in the flow the absolute address of any post or comment or vote is irrelevant and posts and other atrifacts may be copied with appropriate reference back to the original author and some means to get to a url but only as a way to represent an identity

3782554 in spite of a weak economic environment we had a very good quarter
3782555 we are particularly pleased with the strong results we are continuing to see from our seattle operations an acquisition that has contributed positively to our bottom line since we acquired it nine months ago
3782556 even without the gains from our seattle division we are doing well in a difficult business environment
3782557 sales are up earnings are up and we are seeing improvements in many aspects of our business additionally our wide product offering is allowing retailers to quickly adjust to changing consumer preferences at shelf level ensuring that the right products are available at precisely the right time keeping pace with this changing product mix is critical particularly in this economic environment

3782575 this item is available at a discount for a limited time
3782576 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3782577 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3782578 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3782579 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3782580 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3782581 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate

3782584 youre a great athlete you can do anything you can win at the olympics so behave like a champion
3782585 thats what its about thats the job and thats the purpose of this race
3782586 some people totally flip out when they recognize me they start shouting wow look thats the olympic gold medalist its really stressful
3782587 the olympic final is pure energy whoever wins it can say im unique im complete everyone wants that
3782588 there were people who wanted to touch me because they didnt see me as a normal person i was an alien

3782597 the plaintiffs trial bar has found a pastime almost as enjoyable as filing lawsuits convincing congress to pass legislation allowing them to file more lawsuits
3782598 the deep pockets of the plaintiffs trial bar have persuaded some members of congress that america needs more lawsuits in addition to fighting back against each individual earmark we must also uproot the trial bars stranglehold on this congress in order to protect american businesses and families from the costs of more lawsuits
3782599 people can get hurt when they get into a hot car
3782600 theyll think ill just sit on the seat but theyll get actual second degree burns if theyre wearing bathing suits or shorts
3782601 on a 90 degree day in a couple of hours your car can get up to 180 degrees inside
3782602 ive done cookies and theyre edible theyll actually cook up as if you put them in the oven
3782603 they brown up and everything on a little metal tray and youll actually have a meal when you come back ive done bacon which is really disgusting and it actually cooked it crispy and also ive done eggs frying an egg is not a problem
3782604 id say most drivers are not aware of it if its hot they might crack the window a little bit or leave their sun roof open a little bit but i think thats where it ends
3782605 think about anything you might leave in your car like lipstick or cds weve seen cds actually melt while in the radio
3782606 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
3782607 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
3782608 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon

3782612 we nominated charles jay and tom knapp for the offices of president and vice president of the united states because we did not find the nominees of the libertarian party to be suitable we did not do so because we have any essential objection to the libertarian party nor to many of the fine people working within it we did so because we wanted a libertarian candidate to be on the ballot obviously we dont have time to get our candidates on the ballot in every state so we were especially gratified to learn that actual libertarians who favor smaller government on all issues and at all levels are on the ballot in new hampshire and in massachusetts
3782613 the calgary police service takes any allegations of criminal activity misconduct or improper behaviour against its officers very seriously
3782614 truly id like to thank you who saved my life the gentleman who drove a silver coloured 4x4 i dont know his name but i remember he hit the bear
3782615 without him i wouldnt be here i know i only had a minute left probably less
3782616 hes going to eat me hes not going to go away
3782617 i could not sleep i have very bad dreams i still can see the bear that tried to eat me its fresh i cannot get over it right now
3782618 everything that were seeing in terms of the business opportunities and also the progress were making on the restructuring is confirming that our plan is a solid plan and that the execution were getting is good
3782619 i am surprised by how many opportunities there are out there
3782620 many of those opportunities are right within our target space in specialty neurology
3782621 so they are clearly easily within the capability of biovail to do within our existing financial capacity and not overstrain the company
3782622 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
3782623 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
3782624 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
3782625 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
3782626 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
3782627 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
3782628 a police officer could do the same thing with his or her own eyes
3782629 it helps to cut down on the number of police officers who would have to be out tracking particular cars
3782630 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion
3782631 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
3782632 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
3782633 the issue is whether the more sophisticated tools are doing the same things we used to do or are creating a different set of legal circumstances

3782639 church control of schools is about as old as newfoundland it was made formal in the 1927 schools act and it was continued in the terms of union when newfoundland joined canada in 1949 measured against the rest of the country this church control seems curiously dated a quaint anachronism in a secular land

3782657 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3782658 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3782659 they are unfriendly they belong to a country that is at war with us
3782660 russia was hoping that georgian president mikhail saakashvili didnt have as much support as before
3782661 they saw all the opposition rallies and demonstrations there have been in georgia over the last few months and russia thought that everyone would take a stand against saakashvili
3782662 what they didnt reckon with was that in this situation no one is going to come out against him on the contrary not even the opposition is criticizing him thats for another time right now we have a war to defend the fatherland
3782663 now im not interested in that side of things the main thing is for russian soldiers to leave my country and for the war to end
3782664 why bother collecting all their official papers and going to the army recruitment center when theres no certainty theyll actually call me up
3782665 this way i know for sure im off to the forests ill get a weapon and kill those who are attacking us
3782666 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3782667 theyre not making any major commitments to the market canada is facing economic headwinds
3782668 when the dollar quits going up gold quits going down its going to take time to repair this dont look for a quick turnaround
3782669 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3782670 i havent lost to him in six matches since the olympic games
3782671 hes always dangerous you can see how hard he hits the ball
3782672 obviously roger is going to go in as the favorite but thats why we go out there and play
3782673 hes gotten me every time so far but every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top if hes too good for me hes too good for me but i know i have a chance to get into the medal round tomorrow
3782674 it was in the middle of the first set i missed so many shots and i was not playing anywhere near the way i was practicing so it was just kind of frustrating to have practiced so well and to come out and do the total opposite
3782675 today were looking at 1 50 per watt and by 2010 our goal is going to be 0 70 per watt
3782676 i phoned my wife right away to make sure she was ok
3782677 fear and nervousness can get to you at the olympics and you have to stay focused and loose and thats what we did
3782678 we cant wait to show the country what we can do on sunday final
3782679 we had no doubts whatsoever in our minds that we would qualify this had nothing to do with rebounding from sundays underachieving third place finish in their preliminary race it was about executing and racing the way we should race and the way we expect to race
3782680 it is a very great honour to compete in the olympics for my adopted country
3782681 i can buy a loaf of bread or a lotto ticket with a loaf of bread i could eat for a week or so if i buy a lotto ticket i could win a million dollars and eat forever ill get the ticket
3782682 oh you donate to save children how selfless of you here have a citizen of the year trophy
3782683 it just feels good to donate to those less fortunate than yourself
3782684 yes thats the little girl we sponsor our quarters bought her pencils for school and water to drink isnt that wonderful i feel so good about finally being able to make a difference in this world
3782685 the existing system lacks a central data warehouse capability and easy to use views to the information
3782686 i got the ball about 40 yards out and took a touch and just went for it usually i wouldnt take an outside shot but the keeper was off her line and i just hit it
3782687 i think its fantastic that we bounced back from the first 15 minutes against norway
3782688 you look at the first 15 minutes of that game to the last 15 minutes of this game and many things have happened
3782689 it is something i have dreamt about for a long time and was obviously the ultimate goal
3782690 i put a lot of effort into this preparation so im really excited to see the results
3782691 i tried not to look over too much in that last lap i just closed my eyes and focused on all the hard sets i have done
3782692 it was extremely close and i didnt realise how close it was until i saw the scoreboard
3782693 i was trying not to watch the race before i didnt really want to see what time they went but you cant help but hearing obviously with the loud speaker

3782754 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
3782755 i understand that there are some people who wish to bury any new facts concerning the subject of wmd in iraq they are ready to liquidate any person or group who ventures into this subject
3782756 are not ready to give interviews because that endangers their life it would endanger your life as well i am serious in my warning
3782757 nobody can guarantee your life nor the fate of the material you will be collecting in baghdad
3782758 i request that you adjourn your scheduled trip to baghdad
3782759 if you decide to continue with your intention then i am very sorry to tell you that taking the overall environment in my country i am not able to support your mission the main reason would be to preserve my life during or after it is concluded
3782760 i had made several important contacts in regards to your trip
3782761 as you know the situation inside iraq is very dangerous and confused and many people were hesitant to meet with you
3782762 they were afraid of what the americans might do if it was found out that they had met with you
3782763 they just disappeared into the shadows they are still very much a presence in baghdad and iraq

3782782 the militants believe that the shia officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the americans
3782783 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking import of goods from iran
3782784 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shia especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods

3782786 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council siic and the dawa party
3782787 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
3782788 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
3782789 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
3782790 the iraqi government gives 5 million dollars per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province
3782791 we dont have a representative government here or in baghdad because of the heavy iranian influence
3782792 that influence favours only those who support them and injures those of us who do not
3782793 the badr militia and all their political and religious leaders entered iraq on the backs of the american tanks

3782800 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over 5 points in this day and age hes averaged leads of 3 points since spring the key is that obama hasnt closed the sale

3782802 there is something about obama that is causing something of drag
3782803 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide

3782906 you banned us from going to beijing you expelled us from china but despite all that we are here making our voice heard peacefully in a completely non violent fashion it is a way of saying censorship just wont work
3782907 people make fun of china for restricting the places for demonstrations in beijing but france is doing exactly the same
3782908 the paris police have banned any demonstration near the chinese embassy on the grounds that a demonstration has already been authorised on the trocadero esplanade which has become a sort of human rights ghetto
3782909 we are organising demonstrations in nine countries tomorrow to coincide with the olympic games opening ceremony
3782910 we are challenging these orders before the courts because we think we have a right to demonstrate peacefully outside the embassy of any country that does not respect human rights we hope the judge will take this into account and will recognise the non violent nature of reporters without borders protests
3782911 demonstrations organised during the olympic torch relay in paris on 7 april that resulted in outbreaks of violence any demonstration envisaged between 7 a m on 7 august and midnight on 8 august is forbidden
3782912 the aim of these demonstration could be perceived by part of the local population as a provocations likely to elicit hostile reactions that could result in serious public order disturbances
3782913 kehilangan steven pienaar adalah sebuah pukulantelak ia adalah salah satu pemain kami yang paling berpengaruh sejak musim lalu dan khususnya selama pra musim
3782914 tidak dapat diperkuat olehnya sungguh merupakan suatu kekecewan besar ia adalah bagian pokok dari kesuksesan kami musim lalu dan saat ia kembali bermain di pra musim dirinya terlihat begitu tajam jika tidak dapat disebut lebih tajam
3782915 saya setidaknya membutuhkan satu minggu mengembalikan kondisi fisik sebelum kembali tunggu saja dalam waktu dekat ini
3782916 saya sangat menantikan untuk kembali bermain di musim ini karena musim kemarin saya absen enam bulan lamanya kini saya ingin menebusnya dengan menunjukkan kemampuan maksimal
3782917 every time a patch falls on the floor a kitten dies
3782918 all those responsible for the murder the perpetrator s the mastermind s and those protecting them must be brought to justice
3782919 this important case must be taken away from the local officials and brought to the federal level in order to avoid further bias pressure and conflicts of interests and to allow a thorough and impartial investigation
3782920 chauncey bailey was killed because of his work as a journalist
3782921 murders of reporters are rare in the united states in informing people and denouncing public wrongdoings the news media play an important role in the checks and balances that are essential to any democracy the justice system has to send a strong signal to those who would silence the media and show them that impunity will not prevail we call upon press freedom supporters to sign the petition to show public support for a swift resolution of the murder
3782922 the partial lifting of online censorship was just another government public relations operation
3782923 nothing or almost nothing has changed for chinese internet users as very few mandarin sites have been unblocked content referring to human rights the tibet region or the tiananmen square massacre is still blocked
3782924 at the same time as they unblocked certain websites the authorities blocked access to censorship circumvention tools chinese internet users who do not read english have no option but to go to the websites the party has decided to make available
3782925 we continue to feel concern about the delays and twists and turns in the investigation into the murder of hrant dink
3782926 the report produced by the parliamentary sub committee confirms that police and gendarmes in trabzon made mistakes however they both continue to deny being at fault
3782927 we urge that all the investigations currently opened should be joined up so that responsibilities can be sorted out
3782928 i can no longer remember if this case was on the agenda
3782929 if simsek and sahin had such information it was up to them to do what was necessary they didnt need my orders as i have already said i do not remember if i was informed
3782930 we have concluded that there was negligence mistakes and a lack of coordination between the gendarmerie and the police
3782931 by preventing huang from seeing his lawyer the chinese authorities are yet again demonstrating that nothing has changed in china as regards free expression
3782932 huang is the 49th cyber dissident to be imprisoned in china for trying to promote democracy and freedom of expression online we urge the authorities to free him pending his trial
3782933 i am very upset about my husband and i do not understand what is pushing the authorities to bring this charge against him all huang did was report what things were like for the victims after the sichuan earthquake
3782934 the reports we are seeing are biased in reality it is very difficult for ngos to deliver food aid they are obliged to go through government channels the government is using its propaganda to portray itself as a saviour to little avail few citizens trust the government because of the corruptions scandals that already occurred during similar disasters in the past
3782935 the syrian leaders participation in the bastille day ceremonies is shocking
3782936 during his presidential campaign sarkozy made human rights one of the core issues of his manifesto if he were elected he said there would be tougher negotiations especially about russia and china today we are a very long way from those promises this president like others before him is conducting a realpolitik based on economic interests to the detriment of defending the values france is supposed to embody
3782937 chinese human rights activists are being detained harassed or forced to leave beijing while their supporters abroad are being prevented from going to china
3782938 it is against this backdrop that the chinese government and the international olympic committee plan to launch the 2008 summer olympics
3782939 we cannot remain indifferent to the fate of the prisoners of conscience these peaceful demonstrations will offer a response to the cynicism of those who will sit with their arms crossed inside the beijing stadium on 8 august
3782940 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
3782941 ensure that the media are able to report on the games as they did in previous games
3782942 coming just nine days before the opening ceremony this is yet another provocation by the chinese authorities this situation increases our concern that there will be many cases of censorship during the games we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more than sceptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
3782943 a legitimate form of personal expression and not a form of journalism
3782944 taking advantage of democratic freedom to harm the interests of the state and of social and citizen organisations
3782945 in one case the authorities have punished a reporter and pro democracy activist with a heavy jail sentence for writing about the situation of peasants in the south
3782946 in the other case they are keeping two well known reporters in jail because of their coverage of corruption the two cases show that the crackdown continues for dissidents and those trying to push against the limits on free expression
3782947 he was writing about the plight of people in the countryside about corruption about the lack of government honesty and about the constraints imposed on peasants in kien giang province
3782948 we call on the kurdistan authorities to carry out a thorough investigation into the circumstances of hamas murder
3782949 he wrote hard hitting articles about local politicians and security officials and had received threats from people telling him to stop his investigative reporting the authorities should therefore give priority to the theory that he was killed because of his work
3782950 to gag the newspaper which has always been very critical of the government
3782951 it is unacceptable that hu jias family has not been allowed to visit him on his birthday we are worried about his health which is worsening steadily he suffers from cirrhosis as a result of an attack of hepatitis but he has not had a single medical examination since his arrest it is appalling that just a few days before the start of the olympic games a prisoner of conscience is not even being allowed to see his wife on his birthday
3782952 it is ironic that one of the people in charge of organising the olympic games is the head of the bureau of public security which is responsible for so many human rights violations it is very serious that the official promises are not being kept before the games
3782953 holding thomas for 48 hours was outrageous and charging him on five counts is just a ploy by the police and judicial authorities to get him to reveal his sources
3782954 once again a basic principle of journalism is being flouted
3782955 unauthorised publication or reproduction in writing drawing or any other form in violation of the laws and regulations relating to the property of the author and complicity therein
3782956 unauthorised publication of an intellectual product in violation of authorship rights and complicity therein
3782957 these charges seem rather unreal for journalists it is not going to be easy to establish what journalism has become today in france
3782958 he has the right to do everything except talk to the people at renault or to their suppliers
3782959 we leave it to the judicial authorities to decide how they conduct the investigation
3782960 the principle of the confidentiality of journalists sources one of press freedoms cornerstones is again being violated in france by policemen and judges serving the interests of an industrial group that denies the publics right to be informed
3782961 we call for thomas immediate release and the return of everything that was taken from
3782962 the police searched thomas office and the office of one of his colleagues they confiscated photos email correspondence and the hard disks from the computers of both journalists
3782963 glen is a corporate publicist and thinks that things havent changed too much since the days of

3782965 the military is the greatest group of people on the planet plain and simple
3782966 i think its medias responsibility to reflect the bulk kind of the core of whats going on
3782967 its not that the media are biased its the public isnt particularly supportive of this war so why should the media go and find the one or two videos on youtube and give them coverage because they give a human aspect
3782968 in times of change learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists
3782969 when your parents or someone else tries to wake you up in the morning do you want to get up

3782997 kirk was a poor burke scholar burkes attack on metaphysical reasoning related only to modern philosophys attempt to eliminate skeptical doubt from its premises and hence from its conclusions
3782998 all culture arises out of religion when religious faith decays culture must decline though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief
3782999 an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder but rarely conjugating
3783000 as if some eminent neoconservatives mistook tel aviv for the capital of the united states
3783001 a bloody outrage a piece of anti semitism by kirk that impugns the loyalty of neoconservatives
3783002 said people like my husband and me put the interest of israel before the interest of the united states that we have a dual loyalty
3783003 its this notion of a christian civilization you have to be part of it or youre not really fit to conserve anything thats an old line and its very ignorant
3783004 a wisecrack about the slavishly pro israel sympathies among neoconservatives
3783005 always plays into the hands of the left which is then able to repeat the charges and claim conservative endorsement of them

3783012 after the gigs on the gnr tour i was always taking off for the next gig i wasnt so much into hanging around on the last tour i had to keep moving on most of the legs what id do was just roll out after the gig sleep overnight if we were driving by bus get up the next day and get out since day one ive always liked getting up early to see that is going on because at least you get some memories of the places youve seen its too easy to check into the hotel raid the mini bar drink that up and then pass out

3783090 wins for brazil argentina nigeria holland belgium amp ivory coast at the olympics
3783091 het verhaal achter deze medaille spreekt me enorm aan alhoewel er de laatste tijd wat negatieve dingen hierover naar buiten zijn gekomen maar toch eerst met coach selinger en daarna alberda en dan spelers als zwerver echte kerels karakters het moment waarop de italianen de bal achter de antenne slaan en alberda het veld oprent prachtig dat gezicht van hem met de handen in het haar en schreeuwen
3783092 hiermee was het hetzelfde als de volleyballers zoveel persoonlijkheden bij elkaar in dit geval in een boot vooral nico rienks en ronald florijn staan me nog bij omdat die eerder al eens goud hadden gewonnen voor de holland acht worden harde eisen gesteld want wie de finale niet vaart krijgt ook geen medaille daar moesten dus heel harde keuzes worden gemaakt omdat er mensen moesten afvallen dat is misschien nog harder dan bij het volleybal

3783099 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3783100 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3783101 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3783102 therefore there is no risk any longer that we will post an increase of adjusted net income of below 5 percent
3783103 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3783104 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3783105 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3783106 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3783152 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies

3783171 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3783172 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3783173 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

3783177 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3783202 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
3783203 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
3783204 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon

3783442 investing substantially in safety and asset integrity in the north sea which clearly demonstrates our commitment to safety as our first priority

3783444 if they had loaded up this particular lifeboat the chances are it could have been launched into the sea in an uncontrolled fashion which would have caused death or injury as it was held in place by corrosion and not by the designed system
3783445 you can tell warwick that this could still be avoided if shell were to issue a press release stating that their account of things published on 16th june 2006 and widely circulated in relation to the follow up from the 1999 audit was false and misleading and in fact from 1999 till 2003 there had been a sustained decline in essential controls offshore as witnessed by the systemic failures presented by greg hill to the hse in november 2003 and that this decline contributes at least indirectly to the fatal accident and that shell apologises for these false statements and will be dealing internally with the consequences of all this then so be it such a statement would halt my interest and retire into quiet and peaceful seclusion

3783538 tanto ayer contra el eibar como en tenerife al margen del resultado el equipo no estuvo al nivel que tiene que estar el athletic en todos los conceptos
3783539 tanto ayer contra el eibar como en tenerife al margen del resultado el equipo no estuvo al nivel que tiene que estar el athletic en todos los conceptos
3783540 vamos a c diz con la idea de conseguir un trofeo de gran prestigio frente a equipos importantes de la liga y un rival como el c diz que va a hacer que sea complicad simo el partido de ma ana vamos a medirnos y a ver si sacamos provecho al trabajo que vamos desarrollando
3783541 en la camiseta del schalke figura el emblema de su patrocinador la corporaci n rusa gazprom no puedo llevar esa camiseta
3783542 pensaba que me iba a costar m s entrar en el equipo
3783543 a nivel personal mejor no me puede ir sab a que esta pretemporada iba a ser la primera despu s de mucho tiempo y aunque hab a jugado minutos a final de la pasada temporada y hab a sido positivo c mo acab todo pensaba que me iba a costar un poquito m s entrar en el equipo porque llevaba mucho tiempo parado
3783544 todav a me faltan muchas cosas pero es para estar muy contento por estar ah y jugar de inicio
3783545 es positivo para m el hecho de recibir entradas y no tener miedo me esta dando mucha confianza y es positivo dentro de lo malo porque a nadie le gusta recibir patadas ya que poco a poco voy cogiendo confianza
3783546 es uno de los rivales m s fuertes que nos pod a tocar tiene experiencia en europa y eso le va a ayudar va a ser una eliminatoria interesante e igualada
3783547 ser a un error pensar en el partido de vuelta tenemos que sacar un buen resultado aqu y all si queremos pasar tenemos presente que son dos partidos pero hay que pensar en el de ma ana y hacer bien las cosas ahora mismo es complicado decir qu resultado es bueno para la vuelta
3783548 quello di cui dovremmo parlare la sicurezza del cibo e non la sua produzione affidarci alle grandi multinazionali sarebbe un vero disastro le multinazionali spiega il membro della famiglia reale inglese stanno sperimentando con la natura e con lumanit in un modo che andato completamente storto per quale altro motivo stiamo affrontando tutte queste sfide come il cambiamento climatico e il resto
3783549 inghiottiti da una inimmaginabile insostenibile ingestibile e degradata espansione dei centri urbani
3783550 rischiano di trascinarci in una sfera che appartiene solo a dio
3783551 im sure hes been on his best behavior but hes been good
3783552 you put him in the middle of the lineup and he makes everybody better
3783553 not only manny but ex indian casey blake that gives them more balance in their lineup that gives them a better hitting team theyre tough but manny makes their lineup look completely different hes such a good hitter
3783554 once you get past ramirez youve still got james loney and russell martin and blake standing in there thats pretty good i had interest in blake he was in cleveland and i saw him when he was with the twins hes pretty good he can get big hits for you
3783555 it doesnt behoove us to pit ourselves against russia russia is a strategic partner
3783556 takes that high note shoves it into a ruffled wedding dress and beats it to death with a high heeled
3783557 si vero che per i device mobili ci sono funzionalit push ma per il resto no vi eravate sbagliati avete visto male le modifiche fatte da mac o pc si aggiornano solo una volta ogni 15 minuti
3783558 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3783559 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3783560 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3783561 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3783562 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3783563 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3783564 who will be the next president of the united states
3783565 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3783566 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3783567 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3783568 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3783569 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3783570 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3783571 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3783572 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3783573 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3783574 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3783575 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3783576 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3783577 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3783578 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3783579 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3783580 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3783581 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3783582 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3783583 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3783584 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3783585 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3783586 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3783587 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3783588 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3783589 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3783590 ballot access is one of the unknown evils of the american electoral process
3783591 there cant be change by electing a republican or a democrat
3783592 i dont think either of these guys are going to do much
3783593 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3783594 they say barack im a republican but i support you
3783595 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3783596 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3783597 in fact john mccains share of the democratic vote has typically and surprisingly been larger than obamas share of the republican vote
3783598 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3783599 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3783600 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3783601 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3783602 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3783603 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3783604 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3783605 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3783606 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3783607 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3783608 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3783609 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3783610 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3783611 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3783612 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3783613 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3783614 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3783615 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3783616 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3783617 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3783618 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3783619 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3783620 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3783621 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3783622 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3783623 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3783624 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3783625 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3783626 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3783627 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3783628 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3783629 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3783630 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3783631 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3783632 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3783633 real results by the end of my first term in office
3783634 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3783635 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3783636 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3783637 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3783638 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3783639 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3783640 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3783641 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3783642 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3783643 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3783644 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3783645 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3783646 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3783647 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3783648 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3783649 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3783650 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3783651 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3783652 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3783653 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3783654 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3783655 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3783656 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3783657 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3783658 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3783659 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3783660 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3783661 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3783662 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3783663 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3783664 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3783665 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3783666 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3783667 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3783668 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3783669 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3783670 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3783671 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3783672 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3783673 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3783674 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3783675 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3783676 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3783677 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3783678 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3783679 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3783680 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3783681 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3783682 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3783683 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3783684 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3783685 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3783686 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3783687 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3783688 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3783689 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3783690 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3783691 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3783692 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3783693 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3783694 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3783695 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3783696 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3783697 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3783698 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3783699 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3783700 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3783701 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3783702 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3783703 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3783704 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3783705 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3783706 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3783707 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3783708 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3783709 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3783710 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3783711 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3783712 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3783713 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3783714 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3783715 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3783716 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3783717 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3783718 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3783719 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3783720 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3783721 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3783722 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3783723 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3783724 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3783725 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3783726 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3783727 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3783728 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3783729 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3783730 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3783731 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3783732 he nader is a reminder that the democratic process is alive and well and still being practiced
3783733 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3783734 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3783735 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3783736 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3783737 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3783738 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3783739 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3783740 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3783741 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3783742 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
3783743 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
3783744 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3783745 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3783746 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3783747 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3783748 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3783749 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3783750 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3783751 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3783752 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3783753 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3783754 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3783755 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3783756 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3783757 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3783758 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3783759 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3783760 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3783761 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3783762 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3783763 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3783764 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3783765 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3783766 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3783767 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3783768 police in kingston have issued cctv images of a man they wish to trace in connection with a
3783769 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3783770 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3783771 when i saw there was going to be some possibility of personal attacks i refrained from debating my two opponents
3783772 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3783773 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3783774 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3783775 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3783776 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3783777 advertising on google com is contextual requires no personally identifiable information is not provided by a third party and does not collect any information in addition to the basic information collected to provide search results
3783778 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3783779 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3783780 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3783781 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3783782 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3783783 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3783784 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3783785 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3783786 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3783787 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3783788 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3783789 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3783790 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

3783792 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3783793 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3783794 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3783795 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3783796 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3783797 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3783798 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3783799 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3783800 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3783801 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3783802 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3783803 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3783804 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3783805 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3783806 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3783807 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3783808 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3783809 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3783810 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3783811 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3783812 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3783813 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3783814 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3783815 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3783816 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3783817 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3783818 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3783819 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3783820 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3783821 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3783822 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3783823 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3783824 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3783825 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3783826 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

3783835 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

3783875 as wind power capacity rises the lower availability of the wind farms determines the reliability of the system as a whole to an ever increasing extent consequently the greater reliability of traditional power stations becomes increasingly eclipsed as a result the relative contribution of wind power to the guaranteed capacity of our supply system up to the year 2020 will fall continuously to around 4 figure 7 in concrete terms this means that in 2020 with a forecast wind power capacity of over 48 000mw source dena grid study 2 000mw of traditional power production can be replaced by these wind farms

3783887 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3783888 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3783889 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3783890 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species

3783912 these programs are squarely balanced on the backs of teachers

3783915 i feel we have the right to be paid without any gaps
3783916 there are lots and lots of things to be decided
3783917 its a change and some teachers wanted to stay on year round or go to a year round single track which was not given as an option
3783918 but having the calendar in our hands will help that will make a big difference
3783919 i hate it you have to carry all your stuff to every one of your classes and you can barely close your backpack with it
3783920 the notes are just like busy work its easier just to write down normal notes
3783921 there have been some students complaining but theyll also tell you theyve never been so organized in their life
3783922 when they get used to it and it will take some time they will have more time to worry about learning and less time trying to find where they left their homework
3783923 until this year each teacher had his or her own specifications for maintaining school work and notes our students essentially reported to six bosses with systems of organization our teachers have agreed to align their requirements into a single binder format this will permit your child to focus more on academics than organization
3783924 everybody learns differently i think the cornell notes are effective but its not for all students
3783925 it forces students to identify the major points to ask questions and summarize their learning
3783926 thats a major disconnect that students have they go to college knowing how to memorize but they struggle to form an opinion and write about that this will help teach them how to do that

3783953 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3783954 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3783955 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3783956 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation

3783961 renovations of the whidbey apartments and apache street homes have not been undertaken at this time and are not scheduled to start in 4 6 weeks
3783962 prior to beginning any renovations forest city and the navy will be carefully assessing the current housing situation at nas whidbey island before determining what next steps should be taken
3783963 the 240 homes that are articulated in the whidbey option were not and are not included as part of the original design build contractual scope the whidbey option has always been contemplated by the navy as an option to consider an alternative course of action that the navy could exercise to expand the original scope of work

3783969 revenge will be visited upon us for what weve done
3783970 they will take years to get revenge and they will get it

3783978 el juez castillo entreg la resoluci n ya redactada en una hoja escrita en computadora a su secretario para que este la transcribiera letra por letra en la computadora del juzgado esto no suele ocurrir por lo general cuando un juez redacta una sentencia en su computadora personal entrega el disquet o un usb a su secretario para que este la copie en cuesti n de segundos en un archivo de la computadora con eso evita que el secretario pierda el tiempo transcribiendo letra por letra la resoluci n lo que ha ocurrido en este caso

3784066 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3784067 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3784068 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3784069 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy

3784103 spreek geen woord en laat me zien waar die man ligt
3784104 ach lieve vader nu heb ik uw hulp nodig en tenzij u mij nu helpt zijn mijn mooie dagen voorgoed voorbij
3784105 ik was in uw tuin om mij te vertreden en daar vond ik bij de bron sir lancelot du lac slapend
3784106 en het lijkt mij alsof hij nog steeds buiten zinnen is
3784107 we moeten verstandig met hem handelen want deze ridder is zijn verstand kwijt en als we hem ruw wekken weet niemand wat hij zal doen wacht u daarom even en ik zal een betovering over hem uitspreken zodat hij een uur lang niet wakker zal worden
3784108 oh here jezus hoe kom ik hier om godswil mijn goede heer zeg mij hoe ik hier ben gekomen
3784109 u kwam in dit land als een dwaas u was uw verstand geheel kwijt en hier bent u als een gek gehouden en niemand hier wist wie u was tot n van mijn maagden mij bij toeval bracht waar u lag te slapen bij een bron en zodra ik u zag herkende ik u toen vertelde ik het mijn vader en zo werd u hier voor dit heilige vat gebracht en door de kracht daarvan bent u genezen
3784110 als dat waar is hoe velen zijn er dan hier die van mijn waanzin weten
3784111 houd het geheim en laat het niemand op de wereld weten want ik ben deerlijk beschaamd over mijn ongeluk want ik ben voor altijd uit het rijk van logres verbannen
3784112 beste vrouwe elaine om u heb ik veel zorg en verdriet gehad het is niet nodig het te verhalen u weet het wel niettemin besef ik dat ik mij slecht tegen u heb gedragen toen ik mijn zwaard trok om u te doden de ochtend nadat ik bij u had gelegen dat was alles omdat u en dame brusen zorgden dat ik bij u lag tegen mijn wil en zoals u zei werd sir galahad uw zoon verwekt
3784113 naar uw vader gaan en voor mij een huis van hem verkrijgen waar ik in kan wonen want aan het hof van koning arthur kan ik nooit meer komen
3784114 ik wil met u leven en sterven alleen voor uw bestwil en als mijn dood voor u van meer nut is dan mijn leven weet dan dat ik om uwentwil zou sterven ik zal naar mijn vader gaan en ik weet zeker dat er niets is dat ik van hem kan vragen of ik zal het krijgen en waar u bent mijn heer sir lancelot twijfel niet of ik zal daar zijn en u dienen zo goed ik kan
3784115 sir mijn heer sir lancelot verlangt om hier bij u te wonen in n van uw kastelen
3784116 als het zijn wens is om in deze marken te verblijven zal hij in het kasteel van blyant wonen en u zult daar bij hem zijn met twintig van de mooiste jongedames die er zijn in dit land en zij zullen allen van het voornaamste bloed in dit land zijn en u zult twintig ridders bij u hebben want dochter u moet beseffen dat we allen vereerd zijn door het bloed van sir lancelot
3784117 mijn naam is le chevalier malfait dat is te zeggen de ridder die zich misdragen heeft
3784118 het zal wel zo zijn maar het leek mij toch dat uw naam sir lancelot du lac is want ik heb u eerder gezien
3784119 dat is niet hoffelijk van u want stel nu eens dat mijn naam sir lancelot was maar dat ik mijn naam niet wilde onthullen wat zou het u deren om mijn geheim te bewaren zolang u er zelf niet door geschaad werd maar weet wel dat ik u zal schaden als het ooit in mijn macht is waar ik u ook zal ontmoeten
3784120 want ik zal niet spreken over wie u bent zolang u in deze streek blijft
3784121 despite georgias assurances that it would end military action a georgian unmanned drone was detected over tskhinvali on wednesday russian peacekeepers shot it down
3784122 we have discovered an undefended georgian army depot containing a significant amount of military hardware and weapons near the town of gori the military hardware is in full working order and combat ready
3784123 any claims that russian troops are advancing inside georgia are untrue
3784124 i speak to you not as a candidate for president but as a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
3784125 on one level its empty political sloganeering but on another level its not empty its downright irresponsible and an example of the sort of irresponsible behavior that got us into this but this stuff isnt a game putin shakashvili the ossetes and the abkhaz are all playing for keeps we shouldnt imply guarantees that we dont intend to keep which means the public statements of our officials have to be driven by realistic assessments of the situation and of american interests not by mawkish sentimentality
3784126 we have only one president at a time setting international policy he needs to get his ass in gear and deal with the mess he made ill tell you what i propose to do with what bush cant break or cant fix after im elected if im elected

3784129 they were going to war and were struggling with a rationale
3784130 then just maybe the plucky democratic georgians dont have such clean hands in all this after all
3784131 if they were attacked by the russians they cant be all bad
3784132 the country is full of people who strive desperately to find themselves in the middle of a titanic epic global struggle between pure good and pure evil
3784133 i do not think russia will hasten to determine the status of both south ossetia and abkhazia georgia may go through the change of power and demilitarization and may remain a neutral state
3784134 in this case there will be no need to dispute georgias territorial integrity although of course both enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia will have a special status being de facto self governed
3784135 what is currently happening in the caucasus region shows a very significant tendency for resetting conflicts to use a computer term
3784136 the first territorial rearrangement occurred after the u s s r s collapse and now we are witnessing the beginning of the second rearrangement caused by conflicts of the independent countries development russia could establish its own rules of the game however i think that any formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia is not a task of prime importance even after the events that have occurred the two regions leaving georgia will be enough with the time further being on their side back in the day israel was put a great deal of pressure upon as well for its activities in the middle east but the countrys interests were finally recognized
3784137 it is now important for russia to show that we did not send our troops to tbilisi and this will break some of the wests stereotypes
3784138 it is too soon to initiate any discussion on the two territories status the further events will speak for themselves
3784139 even after this war fomenting tensions over the status of south ossetia and abkhazia let alone recognizing their independence would be absurd for russia it would mean a steel trap in the south the country staying alone we cannot do this if anything we cannot be so hasty about it
3784140 georgia will have all the problems but other cis countries wont
3784141 the cis has long turned into an official negotiation table for bilateral projects and integration groups like the eurasec
3784142 apart from saakashvili there are azerbaijan moldova and ukraine unlike in georgia ukraines political elite is disunited and the decision to withdraw from the cis might not go through parliament moldova is ready to compromise on the transdnestr area and azerbaijan which is highly concerned over its own position and the oil transportation contracts through the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline wont venture any radical moves either
3784143 the nature of hostilities causes much puzzlement because it points to the sides being of about the same strength
3784144 this points to the pitiable state of our army the most important thing is that for three days running our army has been unable to silence artillery guns that shell the road
3784145 from a military point of view our army has not demonstrated an overwhelming edge over the enemy rather it looks as though the sides are equal and the war is likely to run for a long time yet
3784146 must be cleverly devised now and the policy of the last few years pursued by russia in relations with south ossetia fully revised
3784147 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with macs wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are missed
3784148 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3784149 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
3784150 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
3784151 at that point in time it will be our official roadmap where it will be the basis and it will be the grounds for us moving forward with all of our modernization plans that we have been communicating to the public
3784152 but the only way to present the movie in a big way was as a gala with eastwood and jolie

3784157 has unlocked the key to making a film about the iraq war
3784158 these films are not necessarily heavy films that set out to win awards theyre just strong films we try to play that guessing game every year and were not good at it were always surprised that some of the films we like dont get that attention
3784159 wild comedies taking on taboos and sacred cows in society
3784160 we are definitely focusing on the jatropha plant for oil production
3784161 enable more kenyans to enjoy and derive comfort from the supply of bio diesel for agricultural production employment creation rural urban balance and blending in the motor vehicle industry
3784162 research trials in mpeketoni lamu a coastal town where there is no power have shown people using the little oil they got from the seeds to light their lamps
3784163 the effect of deforestation and degradation as well as serving as carbon sink
3784164 the use of marginal land ensures that the high potential areas are not converted to energy production areas and therefore it guards against competition between biofuels and food production
3784165 we use a lot of diesel in the factory sometimes we pollute the environment we were looking for an alternative to cut costs
3784166 we thought it would reach full maturity after two years
3784167 it is too cold here the rate of growth is lower the results will be belated
3784168 in 2006 a kilo seeds went for 1000 shillings us 15 today half a kilo of seeds goes for 3000 shillings 46 its very expensive
3784169 they did not have enough scientific knowledge and they did not know the agronomy of jatropha
3784170 there is no ready market for biofuel in kenya yet
3784171 further there would be no munition fragments that could be used to identify the source of the strike
3784172 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3784173 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline

3784178 the software is exceptionally cost effective and really helps us
3784179 now that we have a new infrastructure in place our main goal is understanding what our customer wants and to prepare to fend off competition
3784180 we will look at decreasing costs in it and use the savings to introduce more services to our customers
3784181 it will take time for competitors to catch up with us in terms of technology needed to run services like ours but we must not underestimate our peers
3784182 that is why thorough planning is essential so that we are ready when other companies come up with comparable structures we will be ready to hit the ground running from day one
3784183 managing the it of a business like eurostar is a never ending process you can work round the clock and the job is never finished there are always improvements to be made as customer requirements are constantly changing

3784191 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws
3784192 it is not in any way overturned or compromised by judge brimmers decision in wyoming today

3784199 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3784200 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3784201 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3784202 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3784203 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3784204 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3784205 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3784206 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3784207 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3784208 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3784209 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3784210 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3784211 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3784212 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3784213 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3784214 theres a lot of evidence that the more patients are required to pay more for their care the more that they make economic decisions about what to get or what not
3784215 while some of that may be perfectly reasonable and acceptable what i worry about is people not getting care that is really essential for their health
3784216 yes we know when people have comprehensive health insurance they have a tendency to overuse and access that care more than they absolutely need
3784217 a little bit of discipline may be all right but i would want to err on the side of making sure they can get sufficient care
3784218 we know from past economic downturns that employers and individuals tighten their budgets as a whole but they certainly tighten their health budgets
3784219 the artist must elect to fight for freedom or slavery

3784221 someone else is decorating and im letting that go the party isnt the decorations its the people
3784222 so long and thanks for all the fish so sad that it should come to this we tried to warn you all but oh dear
3784223 our labor market isnt as ideal as it was a year ago
3784224 things arent great here but i think theyre still somewhat better than the nation as a whole
3784225 my instinct is that it probably will get worse before it gets better
3784226 but i dont know if it will get a lot worse
3784227 in terms of some of the shelter issues i think you will see a city and a community that has invested significantly in housing those who need support
3784228 we have invested literally hundreds of millions of dollars which to be candid has nothing to do with the olympics and everything to do with trying to create healthy communities for all of us to live in
3784229 that commitment was for 3 200 new social housing units affordable social housing units and we wont see them

3784233 a company will incorporate offshore where there are no taxes
3784234 that parent company charges the u s company lots of money for things like the trademark for the company logo the u s company says i made 50 million but my stupid parent company charged me 50 million for the logo the u s company gets to deduct the royalty fees as an expense and move profits to the parent company offshore in a tax free haven
3784235 even in a good year a lot of firms are failing
3784236 general motors lost 10 billion in 2005 so how much corporate profit tax would you expect them to pay american airlines lost almost a billion dollars what would you want them to pay when theyre already cutting people they pay when theyre profitable
3784237 dont we all fill out our tax returns as aggressively as we know how and take every deduction and credit were entitled to even if theyre unprincipled even if theyre in the tax code only because congress thinks we will appreciate them for subsidizing us
3784238 its common sense corporations dont earn profits in many years
3784239 all that said i think there probably is large tax avoidance by u s multinational corporations but in my view thats driven by the very high u s corporate tax rate a corporate tax rate cut is long overdue
3784240 we have a pretty high nominal corporate tax rate but effectively its not high at all
3784241 there are many tax avoidance strategies wed be far better off with a simpler structure that made sure taxes were actually paid by corporations
3784242 the united states has the second highest combined statutory corporate tax rate among the organization for economic cooperation and development countries yet is tied with hungary in raising the fourth lowest amount of combined corporate income tax revenue relative to gdp in 2004
3784243 i can definitively say the events that led to the 2003 blackout are much less likely to occur
3784244 smokers literally have to stand in the middle of the street to comply with the law
3784245 privatization is an innovative process where we fuse the redevelopment and the cleanup together and by doing that we get efficiencies
3784246 being able to complete this critical transfer decision will allow the city of seaside to move forward with the planned development new jobs and opportunities envisioned for our community
3784247 but its supposed to correct an economic situation affected by the jobs leaving the community and we get target burger king and jack in the box even at that we dont want it to be at the expense of our health we want those things addressed
3784248 from a public safety standpoint its important to move forward and expedite this cleanup
3784249 it depends on if you have the funding the cleanup the expertise on the type of development and a reuse authority with the knowledge and willingness to take this on and finally you need the support of the local community
3784250 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3784251 i believe oil prices are going up because the demand for oil outstrips the supply for oil oil is going up because developing countries still use a lot of oil oil is going up because we use too much oil and the capacity to replace reserves is dwindling thats why the price of oil is going up
3784252 each time the dollar falls 1 percent the price of the barrel rises by 4 and of course vice versa if this the dollar strengthens by 10 percent it is probable that oil prices will fall by 40 percent

3784254 scott was the friend i mentioned above who use to work there and also a former roommate
3784255 ummm no that is not correct my name is daniel
3784256 no it is daniel d a n i e l
3784257 but about a year ago i started thinking about it now its my turn
3784258 jfk was a role model for everyone i knew back in the early 60s
3784259 hed spoken passionately during my high school graduation year about some new program he was starting called the peace corps i never forgot his message and i tucked it away in the back of my head to act on someday today is my someday
3784260 i had deferred peace corps service for about 30 years and have always wanted to do it
3784261 so then i met scott and he independently mentioned that peace corps was something he always wanted to do so that is kind of what brought it alive for me again
3784262 ive had a pretty good business career and good life and i thought it would be a good thing to give something back
3784263 limiting sonar use in breeding grounds and other key habitat areas is essential for the conservation of whales dolphins and other marine mammals
3784264 this agreement protects both national security and our most treasured natural resources
3784265 we get some areas to train and they get some areas that are off limits
3784266 how anti energy radicals are opposed not just to energy development but to our modern way of life
3784267 can be unfair and unreasonable in their efforts to stop energy development
3784268 ive seen cars get high centered people going the wrong way people trying to dodge
3784269 conf an plenamente en la justicia para que se aclare todo lo que ha sucedido
3784270 existe una nica v ctima que es neira y su familia y un agresor que est acusado de las grav simas lesiones y tambi n existe la posible negligencia en la actuaci n de determinados hospitales de la comunidad de madrid
3784271 hay que tener en cuenta otros criterios para saber si su conducta en ese momento era consciente
3784272 nosotros consideramos que l era perfectamente consciente y que act a de esa manera porque quiere causar el m ximo da o a jes s con lo que su conducta es dolosa y no se puede hablar de imprudencia
3784273 no ha negado los hechos en ning n momento y desde que fue detenido declar que hab a pegado a un hombre
3784274 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3784275 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3784276 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3784277 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3784278 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3784279 a new start honey thank you fer dinner i m now 47kg
3784280 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3784281 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3784282 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3784283 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3784284 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3784285 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3784286 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3784287 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3784288 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3784289 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
3784290 although its more like a one two three four punch
3784291 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim

3784378 i know no canadian taxpayer wants to hear that i really did try my best and i really did give everything i have
3784379 but i swear to all of you that i really did and im very sorry that i didnt bring home a medal but you train and you take your chances
3784380 nobody made me sign a contract that i would guarantee to win i just signed a contract that i would do my best and train my best and give it everything i can but im sorry unfortunately it wasnt enough today

3784392 talk about lyrically is a song i wrote with my good friend derek sperry over the course of about 40 to 50 hours
3784393 the song is a detailed account of the disagreement between two very intertwined and opposing existences it deals heavily with the isolation bitterness and occasional violence felt in something as simple as an argument or difference in opinion
3784394 we just wanted to come up with the most ridiculous and exaggerated metaphors of some lowly human interaction

3784431 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out okay were happy now

3784439 i would hope it stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at that time where britney is at that time
3784440 it is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot

3784456 yes i feel homophobia was the driving force behind the reaction of the three parents that opted to pull their children from the play at the eleventh hour and also the impetus for the principal to cancel the play the same day she received the emails from the parents
3784457 speaking from the standpoint of someone who has dealt with close minded power hungry homophobic and pitifully out of touch school administrators first hand i am convinced that our public school system is on a very dark path
3784458 ive been a devoted drama teacher for six years now often donating my time and resources to the children and the school with whom i worked not begrudging a second of it but loving every moment i spent writing directing searching for costumes painting sets gathering props
3784459 ive fought the good fight over and over have stuck it to the man several times and after all that when no change has been effected i feel i have to move on from the district ive given eight years to in order to preserve my sanity
3784460 no one advocates for you but you if youre exceptionally lucky you have parents who are willing to go to bat for you but they cant attend the investigatory meetings youre forced to endure if you fail to salute
3784461 i want to teach on my terms and be a creative force in the lives of my students im not cut out for pandering to test scores and cow towing to the illogical self centered and destructive whims of incompetent and narcissistic administrators im resigning from my position in my district effective monday i hope to find a place where creativity open mindedness and the best interest of the student are prized above pettiness ass covering and out of control egos i think at some point the students will revolt if my situation and wades is any indicator the students will not go quietly into the night as admin continue to create a learning environment that is stifling and patronizing to them they are much too savvy and sophisticated to tolerate these conditions for long they are educations greatest hope for change
3784462 i honestly believe it was only a small handful of parents that objected to the nature of the content three out of a cast of 52
3784463 unfortunately the principal assumed that was how the entire community would react
3784464 however as painful as it was im not at all sorry it happened the way it did
3784465 where do i go from here good question i want to write direct work with kids i absolutely do not plan to return to conventional classroom academic teaching being a drama teacher in a creative open minded environment would be ideal writing on the side all the while i dont feel my employability has been impacted in a negative way necessarily if a certain district declines to hire me based on what they know of the situation then its for the best i dont belong with people like that anyway

3784467 ive been looking into running vmware on nfs but have been leery of doing it with a standalone nfs server for scalability reasons
3784468 the hesitancy toward using nfs mainly comes from the fact that gigabit ethernet is a bottleneck for most shops
3784469 the way vmware places traffic onto uplinks means that you need multiple vm kernel implementations on different ip subnets as well as multiple nfs servers on different subnets to use all the bandwidth in aggregated links
3784470 we have development engineers working on a linux nfs client which is the main challenge for pnfs

3784477 it could be that people are just getting over that issue ok yes i did try before and i didnt get on and now im going to try again
3784478 we would love to see more because theres clearly so many people who could still benefit from it if you look at the total uninsured adults in our state theres like 350 000 that are actually eligible
3784479 for some reason that kind of bad news hangs in the air like bad cigar smoke
3784480 when there is news in the air that there are no longer waiting lists that doesnt get out
3784481 sometimes if we see a change in the premiums they pay at the beginning of the year enrollment will go down christmas time people are trying to find a way to pay for christmas presents and enrollment will go down
3784482 probably the finest leader the state patrol has ever had he took us through the tumultuous 60s with everything from angry african americans storming the governors office to huge union protests to rioting in the streets and he handled it all with great caution and great care
3784483 hes the first chief to actually integrate the patrol he introduced women blacks asians and hispanics to the agency he totally integrated the outfit
3784484 it obviously gave me my start which led to me sitting in a chair in an office he once occupied
3784485 he mentioned that to me yesterday on his deathbed that he loved his troopers
3784486 he had a good 92 years we have to look at it that way
3784487 any bacteria on his skin could have been deposited giving people food poisoning
3784488 we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident
3784489 we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video
3784490 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3784491 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3784492 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3784493 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3784494 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3784495 what we want to do is nip this in the bud by exempting the military personnel who are traveling under orders from having to pay a fee on their third bag
3784496 if you have a family at home and you stand at that airline counter and you have three bags in your hand and they say you cant get on board unless you pay 100 up front right now what are you going to do
3784497 if they pay they get reimbursed so at the end they dont pay a dime
3784498 theres a lot more on their mind than to have to worry or try to remember to get a hundred dollars reimbursed to them when they get into a war zone
3784499 nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3784500 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3784501 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3784502 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3784503 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3784504 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3784505 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3784506 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3784507 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3784508 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
3784509 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
3784510 i saw them slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them
3784511 very heavy handed killing of civilians backfired on them the sunnis just wouldnt stand for it any more
3784512 that the s 300s would make an air attack more difficult
3784513 its highly unlikely that those air defense missiles would be in iranian hands any time soon

3784538 the weekend wasnt about scoring goals it was the last time playing with a lot of my teammates burlingame is a friendly rival we wanted to wrap the year with a win and we did it
3784539 im excited to start college but nervous at the same time
3784540 im enjoying my summer playing for the wave then looking forward to playing with my new college teammates the leadership may be different on next years extreme team but the skill will never go away theyre always going to be a very good team
3784541 we have five teams with ranging age levels including two high school teams one with our more experienced players and the other team with newer players
3784542 we all worked well together a lot of us have been playing together for over five years this season was a lot of fun it was great to beat burlingame and win league again
3784543 jessica has been with us for six years and has done a great job with this group of girls
3784544 she started coaching several of these girls when they were in the sixth grade
3784545 i got to watch one of the top programs in the country
3784546 i decided to start this club as a another way for girls to have fun soccer has gotten so competitive starting this club gave girls in the area another opportunity to play a great sport
3784547 molly making the team is really a tribute to her hard work and the hard work of her teammates and coaches

3784554 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3784555 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3784556 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3784557 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional cease fire
3784558 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russia actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3784559 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule on sept 16 1924 the times
3784560 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
3784561 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3784562 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
3784563 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
3784564 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
3784565 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
3784566 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship
3784567 when i was growing up i found that the main argument against laissez faire and for socialism was that socialism and communism were inevitable you cant turn back the clock

3784571 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3784572 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3784573 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3784574 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3784575 were very pleased that hugh has accepted this important role
3784576 he joins us with a huge amount of experience and will be here for contact sessions to help us with our preparation and understanding of the laws at all times particularly in light of the new challenges the elvs will present
3784577 we will need to put in a huge amount of work to make sure that we are disciplined at all times and hugh will work with the players and coaches at the club in order for us to hit our targets in this crucial area
3784578 we want to be on the front foot in terms of our preparation for the season having hugh with warriors to assist us in that process for every match will be very extremely productive

3784627 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3784628 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3784629 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3784630 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3784632 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates

3784648 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3784649 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3784650 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3784651 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3784688 politizarea cazurilor de coruptie de catre parlamentul romaniei si incapacitatea sistemului judiciar de a pronunta sentinte in cazurile de coruptie la nivel inalt au diminuat perceptia opiniei publice asupra respectarii statului de drept

3784695 to say i believe in honesty while you still have a hard time being honest all the time does not undermine the belief in honesty it just means that pretty much anyone who is a believer is in the process of moving into the reality of what he or she believes and yes the church is full of hypocrites at one time or another but god is not to blame for that the difficulty we all have with practicing what we believe is exactly why we need god

3784703 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3784704 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3784705 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3784706 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby

3784781 i fully expect that there will be some mention of humanitarian assistance
3784782 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
3784783 this is a tripartite negotiating framework you cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree
3784784 breast feeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3784785 he said that there was a risk that immediately after the games a million chinese will settle in tibet to further dilute the tibetan population
3784786 he gave us very worrying information about the situation in tibet speaking of arrests torture summary executions and a reinforcement of the chinese military presence through new barracks
3784787 they should not isolate china they must bring china into the world community and create genuine friendship
3784788 the importance of vitamin d may be underappreciated there are studies that link low vitamin d levels to the development of heart disease peripheral arterial disease diabetes hypertension and different cancers
3784789 those who had the lowest levels of vitamin d had a 26 percent higher risk of death from all causes compared to those with the highest vitamin d levels
3784790 we have credible reports of villages being burned shootings and killings
3784791 russian tanks are going through villages inhabited by the georgian population and throwing people out of the houses pushing people into concentration camps that they are setting up in those villages and separating men and women
3784792 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3784793 taking advantage of this lull we are reburying those killed in the georgian aggression
3784794 many were buried in a hurry just where they were killed in orchards and kitchen yards yesterday we recovered 18 decomposing bodies from under the rubble in tskhinvali today we found another four
3784795 most vars are used to doing on premise implementations very client server centric implementations its about fulfilling business needs being much more of a consultant

3784807 salt sensitivity in children is low and rises with increasing age through adulthood
3784808 during adolescence about 18 percent to 20 percent of adolescents in the general population have the condition however in the study salt sensitivity was present in 37 percent of all low birth weight lbw and in 47 percent of the children who were small for gestational age sga
3784809 these children should be followed for signs of reduced renal function and also for an elevated blood pressure
3784810 theres nearly a 50 percent chance of favorably affecting blood pressure by simply reducing salt intake in children born sga and nearly a 40 percent chance for those born with lbw these individuals can be determined very easily if their family physician just gets data on their births

3784817 the students asked a lot of really intelligent questions and seemed genuinely interested in how a family business operates and how i personally separate business from family
3784818 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3784819 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3784820 this should be a wholesome development for the us for it promises both political stability for the worlds largest country and continuing opportunities for the us to export to and invest in the worlds fastest growing economy
3784821 apparently context is everything so the united states attacking grenada or nicaragua or panama or iraq or serbia is justified even if the reasons sometimes dont hold water or dont hold up before the united nations the hague or other institutions of international law
3784822 however when russia attacks georgia in a border dispute over georgias determination to throttle secession movements in two semi autonomous regions everyone must agree that georgias sovereignty is sacrosanct and russia must be condemned
3784823 u s newspapers such as the new york times see nothing risible about publishing a statement from president george w bush declaring that georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3784824 no one points out that bush should have zero standing enunciating such a principle iraq also was a sovereign nation but bush invaded it under false pretenses demolished its army overthrew its government and then conducted a lengthy lew rockwell
3784825 much too fun to waste on just one set of game rules

3784841 we intended to bring in three top players but that was before the credit crunch the owner has invested an incredible amount of money but we cannot keep spending the amount we have since the summer of 2007 in excess of 60m on players
3784842 on top of that you have agents fees while the wage bill has gone up substantially all that and with just 20 000 coming through the gates

3784845 health care costs you can do a reasonably good job quantifying but quality of life and the actual value of life is a bit difficult

3784851 moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals while the democracies of the west are not the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy
3784852 saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein
3784853 it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state justice must be done what is decisive is how the world community and above all how the european union positions itself nothing can be done with cowardly wimpy peace appeals
3784854 the lost of breakaway provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nations leadership as georgian president saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces the nation might be able to gain some perspective the status of both regions however will play an important role
3784855 five months before the end of his presidency president bush has been called to action georgia his best friend in the former soviet bloc has been crushed by the russians

3784932 well im not against offshore drilling per se you know weve got 68 million acres that are already under lease in america right now and if oil companies would start drilling there right this very minute then the question of what comes about from drilling would be answered
3784933 the people who know best are telling me that with the 68 million acres the federal government already has leased id rather take those 68 million acres that are already leased and lets just go drill there starting tomorrow
3784934 to analyze and make clear all the relevant evidence on drilling off our coast
3784935 north carolinas policy should be based on science not politics and polls
3784936 bev perdue supports efforts in congress to find common ground as part of a sensible and comprehensive energy policy for our nation but we must make sure that any policy on offshore drilling would allow north carolina to have a final say it should not just target the southeast coast and it must require oil companies to start taking action on drilling in the 68 million acres where they already have leases
3784937 once again pat mccrory will say and do anything to deceive north carolinas voters just like he did on private school vouchers and minimum wage hes trying to fool voters because he knows bev perdue is the one candidate who will help middle class families in our state
3784938 im depressed im exhausted i just want to sleep all the time as soon as i wake up i go back to sleep im not exercising ive stopped cycling ive stopped going to the gym im not eating properly but im gaining weight anyway the flat is a mess im distant from the people i love i cant write i cant concentrate long enough to read i find myself standing in the kitchen clicking the kettle on and off i am so anxious that my nails are almost bleeding i burst into tears for no reason i feel like a failure i have suicide on the brain it wont shut up
3784939 yes you are depressed dont hold yourself to ransom over the things you dont feel able to do right now do what you can and dont agonise over what you cant its not your fault
3784940 were not going to pay 4 dollars a gallon for gas when i am president because we are going to drill offshore and we are going to drill now we are doing to drill here and we are going to drill now
3784941 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants to inflate your tires
3784942 nuclear power represents more than 70 percent of our noncarbon generated electricity it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option
3784943 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
3784944 is there anyone that is tired of paying four dollars a gallon for gasoline is there anyone that is sick and tired of it is there anyone that wants to become energy independent
3784945 well i am telling you right now we are sending 700 billion dollars abroad and your congress just went on vacation for five weeks tell them to come back and get to work
3784946 oh shit i am in some really deep shit here
3784947 just couldnt lose chump hes the only one wholl close every night

3784949 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3784950 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3784951 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3784952 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3784953 you can find these ingredients anywhere these days even in your grocery store
3784954 the ordinance is primarily aimed at home depot which has 11 stores in los angeles and would like to open at least a dozen more it would require new or renovating stores to have a plan for what to do when the day laborers show up as they almost always do when home depot moves in

3784959 he helped create the bella vista united civic association and hes also helped thousands of vietnamese people come to philadelphia stay here legally and grow businesses and families here throughout this time charlie became a civic leader beyond the immigrant community he is one of many quiet and humble civic leaders in philadelphia who toil in the fields of community service looking for no recognition credit or accolades
3784960 the government of vietnam has confiscated his passport placed him under house arrest in his hotel and has interrogated him for many hours daily during these last 18 days
3784961 he could be seen walking through bv on a daily basis with the bvuva immigrant outreach committee office on the 900 block of washington avenue he worked out of there as much as possible and attended every bv community event whether it was immigrant outreach related or not charlie is a great guy and we need him back in bv philly needs him hes the anti joey vento here in south philly
3784962 i would encourage you to contact your elected officials as well as the us consulate in viet nam 84 822 9433 ext 2159 country code 011 to let them know that we want charlie to have a fair process and that we are watching how he is treated
3784963 its very very troubling to think that we had less than acceptable standards of performance within our call center
3784964 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3784965 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3784966 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3784967 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3784968 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3784969 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3784970 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3784971 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3784972 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3784973 who are open to doing something on the production side
3784974 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3784975 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3784976 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3784977 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3784978 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3784979 i think the question over whether this capability works has been settled
3784980 the question is what kind of threat how large a threat how sophisticated a threat the us faces
3784981 we provided a lot of information before it took place
3784982 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3784983 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3784984 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3784985 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3784986 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3784987 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3784988 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3784989 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3784990 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3784991 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3784992 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3784993 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3784994 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3784995 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3784996 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3784997 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3784998 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3784999 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3785000 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3785001 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3785002 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3785003 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3785004 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3785005 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3785006 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3785007 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3785008 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3785009 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3785010 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3785011 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3785012 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3785013 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3785014 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3785015 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3785016 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3785017 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3785018 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3785019 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3785020 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3785021 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3785022 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3785023 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3785024 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3785025 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3785026 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3785027 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3785028 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3785029 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3785030 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3785031 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3785032 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3785033 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3785034 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3785035 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3785036 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3785037 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3785038 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3785039 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3785040 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3785041 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3785042 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3785043 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3785044 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3785045 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3785046 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3785047 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3785048 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3785049 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3785050 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3785051 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3785052 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3785053 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3785054 i definitely came back after the second round i thought i was at least up a point but i was down two points but thats the way it goes
3785055 there was a bit of expectation but i was confident i could get through and i had a good draw
3785056 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
3785057 theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins
3785058 hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the field
3785059 we were looking for an amazingly fast swim the way hed swam in prelims and semifinals at least a second better than that
3785060 but thats not just with swimming we do that with everything if we lived in the taj mahal after six months it would be home
3785061 he sort of defies description because in my opinion there is no historical precedent for what he has accomplished how he is accomplishing it his body of work thus far you have at once a supremely gifted athlete with a willingness to endure unmatched levels of preparation on top of this he is a fantastic competitor very mentally tough and he appears thus far to get even better in the face of a tough challenge
3785062 its good to see kobe bryant is there to see the greatest athlete in the world if kobe goes out and wins a gold medal in badminton thats what its like to see this guy win the 200 fly and swim that leg in the 400 free
3785063 hes not from another planet hes from the future and his father sent him back in a time machine sixty years from now hes only an average swimmer but hes sent him back here to mop up
3785064 hes so young and yet so experienced and so clever hes the man hes my no 1 favorite
3785065 the expectations are so high but he puts it high for himself you come in as the world record holder but still youve got to prove it it is the moment sublime the moment of truth he is always ready i really really hope hes going to get the eight
3785066 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3785067 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3785068 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3785069 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3785070 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3785071 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the u s
3785072 was foggy in his memory of how he heard about the information
3785073 i recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3785074 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3785075 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3785076 the deleterious effect of video games gets more press coverage than beer so it makes sense to me also most parents havent played gta but most have had a beer so they are less concerned about the devil they know than about the devil they dont know
3785077 sounds like a lot of parents believing what theyre told by the media about these games rather than having a look for themselves and realizing the sex and violence elements are blown out of all proportion
3785078 we specifically chose the game because it has emerged over the history of games as the most controversial of games out there it is a game clearly marked mature but there are still parents out there who dont understand that and their kids are playing it
3785079 its been interesting the conversation that the press release has sparked its certainly one of the intentions for us we want to create dialog amongst parents we certainly didnt set out to be hyperbolic about it we just simply wanted to report some of the findings we had in our community
3785080 instead of asking the question in the most basic terms we put a little bit of twist to it we asked our question in a more interesting way in the case of the second poll it was done the same way
3785081 have your views changed in the 14 years at the seminary
3785082 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3785083 could you do this job if you didnt believe in god
3785084 i like giants especially girl giants cause all girls feel too big sometimes regardless of their size
3785085 geothermal energy or heat from the earth is largely non polluting and is renewable and reliable
3785086 throughout the globe heat is continually produced in a layer far below the earths crust large power plants can capture and use this steam to provide electricity on a fairly large scale
3785087 in iceland by some estimates 50 of all energy needs are met through an alternative energy source that has been known for a long time
3785088 geothermal is used in many other places as well the largest system in operation is in california just north of san francisco in an area known as the geysers
3785089 efforts are also underway to use geothermal heat via hot dry rock technology rocks are broken up by pumping water through them at high pressure water is then pumped through the broken rocks so that it can be heated by the earths energy
3785090 finally geothermal energy also can be tapped through ground source heat pumps effective in heating and cooling individual buildings this approach takes advantage of the fact that just five to 10 feet below the ground there is a constant temperature of around 50 degrees f
3785091 right now the u s has nearly 3 000 megawatts mw of installed geothermal energy capacity and is the global leader in total geothermal electric power production
3785092 over the next five to 10 years capacity should grow by at least 20 a year three companies are particularly well positioned to lead this growth starting with chevron
3785093 while oil of course is its main focus chevron is the worlds largest geothermal energy producer with facilities that include two plants in indonesia and two in the philippines the companys huge capital base gives it the wherewithal to fund continued research and installations
3785094 with 2007 representing chevrons fourth consecutive year of record earnings the company is a strong pick for many reasons making it a safe way to get in on geothermals expected expansion
3785095 a riskier play is calpine corp the primary producer of geothermal energy in north america its the operator of the huge geothermal facilities at the geysers which meet nearly 70 of the average electrical demand for californias north coast region
3785096 calpine created in 1984 grew rapidly in its first two decades aggressively purchasing natural gas fields and gas turbine plants as well as moving into geothermal energy and by 2001 it was the worlds ninth largest producer of electricity
3785097 in 2005 however it filed for bankruptcy as its aggressive leveraged expansion efforts foundered in the wake of californias energy crisis of the early 2000s and enrons collapse early this year the company emerged from bankruptcy with its old shares canceled and new stock issued
3785098 finally the pure play geothermal company with the best defined growth prospects is ormat technologies its the second largest producer of geothermal electricity in the u s which accounts for around 75 of the companys revenues
3785099 its 11 geothermal power plants produce an average of 32 mw per year per plant and it has a further 270 mw of capacity in various stages of development
3785100 ormat is a leader not only in geothermal energy but also in recovered energy power generation which refers to the capturing of waste heat generated from industrial processes and converting it into electricity
3785101 ormats reputation is built on its pioneering work the company owns more than 75 patents and has the sectors leading technology and on the fact that it designs and makes most of the equipment it uses further boosting its importance within the sector
3785102 revenues grew 12 4 in the most recent quarter vs the like year earlier period while earnings per share of 24 cents were above expectations and while the p e at 30 is relatively high the companys expected rapid growth gives it a peg of just 1 2

3785115 the united states government obtained assurances and we also had the right sort of reception capability on the ground at tbilisi
3785116 thats not my area but the bottom line is we will respond to the nations tasking as it unfolds
3785117 as i understand it commercial aircraft continue to operate from tbilisi
3785118 except when you win chris agreed lumpi nate he might be an ass hat but i disagree entirely that he deserved to be lumpi she punched him in the face and threatened to kill him in a hysteric voice that sounds as nate ha he deserved it what an incredible ass hat
3785119 he was the only real player who stood out for me in the game
3785120 he was a big body who always seemed to be in on the mix and making plays his persistence and presence on the puck really made him stand out in my mind
3785121 taylor hall was clearly the most impressive from the forward point of view netting three goals and an assist with the empty netter
3785122 taylors outside speed and quick shot were the hardest to handle
3785123 he had good size and a pretty high skill level
3785124 he mainly stuck to the european style of hockey and didnt use his size much but he was effective nonetheless
3785125 schappi was pretty good he was a big player and had good timing with the puck and in going to the net
3785126 small guy but hes tough to play against in his defensive zone and he had good offensive instincts as well
3785127 hes an undersized defenseman but strong in his end and fairly physical for his size also for a blueliner he has a decent skill set and is good at moving the puck up to his forwards
3785128 this week we bring you 19 year old wilder he straight from miami and enjoys working out and showing off its summer so you know that you can find him on the beach wearing almost

3785131 viewer beware what you are watching may be artificially enhanced
3785132 what happened on the night of august 7 is beyond comprehension
3785133 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas
3785134 russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3785135 i have set my voice mail system to send me an email with the message attached as a
3785136 the deal is not sustainable and it is not going to solve the crisis the country is experiencing
3785137 zanu pf is not prepared to concede power they would rather divide conquer and rule
3785138 whatever they do they should not ignore the morgan tsvangirai faction as this would result in a serious legitimacy crisis for any government that will be formed
3785139 there is no way the economy will recover if sanctions imposed by western countries are still in place
3785140 to put it mildly mugabes government has displayed very poor economic management and zimbabwes economy will not recover until his disastrous policies are reversed
3785141 his only option is to participate in the negotiation process but there is not much he can do to force mugabe to make concessions
3785142 this is another example of integrating exxonmobils project management capabilities with developing angolan businesses and suppliers to deliver exceptional value
3785143 the timely and cost efficient development of this resource provides additional production to help meet the worlds growing energy demand working closely with sonangol we have reached another milestone in developing angolas significant petroleum resources in a manner that maximizes the value of the resource for angola co venturers and our shareholders
3785144 angola is a key building block for statoilhydros international production growth weve been in the country for 17 years and are now partners in nine producing fields which contribute more than 200 000 barrels of equity production per day to our portfolio statoilhydro has delivered more than 30 annual production growth since 2001 and angola is one of the main contributors to this great result
3785145 and theres more to come we also expect block 4 to start producing in 2008 and in a few years block 31 will come on stream

3785152 it is another race and if you do it any differently to how you do it before youre probably not going to swim as well so you just shut out all the distractions and have fun

3785155 the average is approximately 9 to 9 50 a pound
3785156 health care premiums have doubled since 2 000 which is a shocking number if you think about it and the legislature has not been able to take concrete action we and hundreds of citizen activists that are working on this across the state are convinced that if the public is given the ability to speak with a clear voice by having advisory referendums this fall that a message can be sent to the state assembly
3785157 well i think its a great idea i think i know what the outcomes of the referendums will be i think pretty much everybody does this is tied into legislators who dont think health care is that much of a priority or health insurance is that much of a priority i think voters in wisconsin will be pretty loud on this one
3785158 we all agree that health care costs are out of control their plan doesnt address the cost of health care all it does is take the current amount of money that we spend on health care premiums spread it around to a payroll tax on employers and employees and then magically assume that were going to continue to have the quality of health care that weve all come know in our state
3785159 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying

3785179 the potential legal implications of texting while driving go far beyond the possibility of a mere traffic violation in the case of a traffic accident proof that the driver was texting while driving may be used to help prove liability for the accident even in states that do not ban texting while driving
3785180 carry me in your heart the life and legacy of sarah schenirer founder and visionary of the bais yaakov movement
3785181 the ideas that i quoted in my talk belong to rav s r hirsch
3785182 almost seventy years have passed since and we have today most unfortunately an easy enough means of demonstrating that all cultures which we then venerated have revealed themselves to be nothing but a flimsy veneer covering over diabolical inhumanity european humanitarian ideas so prevalent then so much on the tip of everyones tongue preached by leading university representatives have been proven utterly hollow for they did not succeed in preventing and indeed could be said to be frequently instrumental in strirring up the raging terrible fire of mans inhumanity to man
3785183 campbells would represent a nice fit with the company were always looking for opportunities to expand and grow
3785184 one day a man was walking along the seashore he noticed that during the night many seashells and starfish had washed upon the beach thoroughly enjoying the morning sun and cool sea air the man walked for miles
3785185 if i leave them on the beach the sun will soon dry them and they will die i am throwing them into the ocean so they can live
3785186 according to the law this doesnt rise to a crime
3785187 why dont you get your boyfriend to bite it off you
3785188 i bet your boyfriend would like to take that off
3785189 i just hope we dont all try to jump on that ship and go its me let me be the man to take over
3785190 no lets just stay within ourselves like we are and just keep it chill on the field we all know how important those guys were i mean hell you aint going to replace them no matter who you bring up or who you get unless you go out and get one of the best players of the game and youre still not replacing them because those guys are part of this team
3785191 the mass whether it be a crowd or an army is vile
3785192 so parents and teachers need to revise their thoughts about this
3785193 stereotypes are very very resistant to change but as a scientist i have to challenge them with data
3785194 are you relating going through heavy changes in touch with yourself and doing your own thing are you up front or just hung up and uptight
3785195 difficult to avoid and there is often an embarrassment involved in not using it somewhat akin to the mild humiliation experienced by american tourists in paris who cannot speak the native tongue
3785196 there are two means of refuge from the miseries of life music and cats
3785197 you might think you need to imagine something 10 times or 100 times before it has an impact
3785198 our results show that even a single instance of imagery can tilt how you see the world one way or another dramatically if the conditions are right
3785199 understanding ourselves is largely an effort to understand where we are headed understanding others is more of an effort to understand where they are
3785200 you can look at yourself from the street level or you can look at yourself from the satellite level other people see you from the satellite level so if you think of yourself from that big picture perspective youll tend to be more accurate
3785201 while we live our own lives under a microscope and we are present all the time when we do things other people are not there with us
3785202 thats a problem for intuiting other peoples thoughts because we tend to evaluate ourselves in much finer detail we look at ourselves from the street view whereas other people are looking at us from space
3785203 my pet peeve is the use of ocd in i get really ocd about cleaning my kitchen whats really offensive about the usage is that it suggests one can spontaneously develop and un develop a disorder this is offensive to people who actually live with mental illness daily unless its interfering with your functioning its not a disorder
3785204 using fetish to mean a fascination with rather than its true meaning causing sexual arousal
3785205 every time i hear someone misuse the term acting out i begin experiencing homicidal ideation of course acting out is a psychoanalytic term denoting the enactment of an internal dynamic in the external world you cant recognize the internal feeling states and so it is necessary to act it out but even among fully trained licensed clinical psychologists this term has come to mean behaving badly which of course makes it a useless term
3785206 since i am not a native english speaker i didnt come across someone calling me anal until i started to study in england at first i was shocked since i didnt immediately understand my friend was not referring to my anus but to my personality i dont think many people realize that they are referring to one of the personality traits emerging from the failure to successfully complete one of freuds developmental stages
3785207 two terms that i think are way over used and misapplied are extrovert contrary to what people seem to believe youre not one or the other and the huge lists of attributes that get attached to each term are by no means accurate for everyone
3785208 in every mental health job i have worked the real pain in the ass clients are referred to as borderline borderline has now ceased to be a disorder its psychobabble for this client is so annoying and needy i would gladly chew off my own foot to escape
3785209 the most irritating one is the word schizophrenia which is wrongly used whenever someone refer to split personalities i just cant hold myself back from being a besserwisser and telling them that they have no idea what schizophrenia is
3785210 when people describe themselves or others as being type a when in fact theyre nothing like what type a is supposed to be never mind the ridiculous dichotomy of dividing all human beings into having these collection of traits and not having these collection of traits
3785211 one of the richest sources of psychobabble is educational psychology particularly in the area of giftedness so we have
3785212 people dont talk about their emotions anymore they vent contrary to the psychobabble though people are not like steam engines
3785213 here are two glorious examples of psychobabble from the world of business socialize as in lets socialize that idea around the group and get some feedback translation lets let people know what our idea is and see if they like it and institutionalize as in once weve socialized our strategy and have gotten buy in from our sponsors lets make sure it gets institutionalized throughout the organization
3785214 after a traumatic event say the va tech shootings grief counselors parachute in to help the survivors witnesses move on my father died over 20 years ago i still dont have closure though i stopped grieving after what apparently was an appropriate interval his absence is an ongoing part of my life that i dont think will close
3785215 hardwired is surely one of the most abused terms in both science journalism and everyday language according to even usually quite reliable sources were hardwired for money risky behaviour religion feeling others pain art fraud oh and liking pink if youre a girl of course
3785216 in the united states consumers are expected to spend 80 million this year on brain exercise products up from 2 million in 2005 advertising for these products often emphasizes the claim that they are designed by scientists or based on scientific research to be charitable we might call them inspired by science not to be confused with actually proven by science
3785217 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
3785218 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
3785219 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
3785220 we want to make sure we got our game plan set

3785222 the bounty discovery has met our expectations and has proven up a large high quality natural gas reservoir that in combination with our extensive 3 d seismic data in the area appears to exceed 7 000 acres in size i am confident the bounty well will initially produce at approximately 200 mmcf d of sales natural gas at the anticipated pipeline pressure this compares favorably with production from the nearest analogous field dolphin deep where each of the two wells in this field produce at approximately 150 mmcf d given the magnitude of the bounty discovery we plan to move forward expeditiously with appraisal and development drilling and production

3785226 demeaning portrayals of women dampen the dreams of our daughters
3785227 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters
3785228 being a maid would have enhanced my chances with men
3785229 the royal navy will not be participating in the quadrilateral exercise
3785230 it would be highly inappropriate to do so in current circumstances
3785231 greater rest rehab and conditioning phases between tours this is particularly relevant for those players playing both forms of the game and never being able to sufficiently rest and recover from niggles this has meant that a number of players are consistently carrying problems from tour to tour
3785232 ive never played cricket in india so it would be a big deal for me if i were picked to go on englands tour of india this winter
3785233 ive got aunts and grandparents over there and theyd really support me ahmedabad would be a big match for me its daunting really
3785234 its all been a bit too quick for me the last two weeks really my mind has been going at 100mph and ive been overwhelmed that ive been picked so i have just got to keep doing what i have been doing for notts and hopefully it will all work for me
3785235 i cannot stress enough how much i want to get out there and play for england since i got the call i have been thinking about how i would bowl at particular south african batsmen
3785236 you cant really think too much about it it has to happen on instinct ive watched the coverage but im sure well have team meetings about them as well
3785237 ive been visualising their shots and the way they play visualising what they will do in a certain situation of an over maybe off the first ball and last ball of an over i visualise what they would try to do to me if i was bowling when i was batting
3785238 he has a great test record and one day record and youd be daft not to look at him the way he bowls
3785239 hes been great he was really good i picked his brains he wasnt there at nottinghamshire for that long which is a shame but he is one of the top left arm spinners
3785240 the summer has been pretty good for me ive enjoyed my test cricket and ive learned a few things about myself the way i have played my cricket its improving
3785241 i havent heard what shane warne has said but from my personal point of view i do feel that adding variation to my pace changing my angles maybe having different tactics in terms of my field settings and making the right decisions at the right time is an important stage of my development
3785242 i feel it will make me into a better bowler
3785243 ive been playing international cricket now for a couple of years and i guess people get more of an idea of how i bowl and how i try to get people out
3785244 i am determined to work on my game it gives me a sense of positive energy knowing that i am working on certain areas and it excites me
3785245 probably when i take a wicket the enthusiasm and passion that comes out is just a genuine love for the game that i have
3785246 it is something that i definitely try and enjoy as much as i can even when i am celebrating i am probably getting over excited jumping doing all sorts
3785247 but it is just the sheer passion i have for the game that naturally comes out when i get a wicket
3785248 there is just a mutual understanding with the umpires where it is just sheer excitement that comes out we both have that understanding where its excitement and passion coming out into the appealing
3785249 the umpires kind of find it amusing at times but its just the enthusiasm that comes out
3785250 i get along with all the umpires really well and have a good banter as well i just enjoy playing international cricket so much that maybe that childhood excitement comes out
3785251 at the time because the passion and pride i have playing for england is there the frustration probably comes out quite a bit
3785252 you want to do well you want to take wickets and when you get a dismissal or know that he has gloved it its that sheer attachment to the game you want that wicket that sometimes gets you really frustrated as well
3785253 so thats probably one of the things that ive got to look at ok decisions may not have gone my way but i have got to try to create it again and tell myself if i can do that again
3785254 that will stand me in good stead and toughen me up as well
3785255 we are just having banter about it now and having a joke about it
3785256 sometimes in cricket when everyone is passionate about the game frustration does come out
3785257 but in the general context it shows how badly we all want to win and its a healthy thing to have
3785258 it is obviously tricky because if you are in a position like me having only played a dozen or so internationals you certainly worry about giving your place up and not winning it back
3785259 inside me i think i would not have a problem id trust in them but then your family is saying you must be crackers and your girlfriend is saying i dont want you to go
3785260 i dont want to have to make a decision on it i dont think any player would want to make a decision on it personally
3785261 but if we go ill go and hope that the security out there is as good as we have been told it will be
3785262 there are reasons why they are doing all the security checks and im happy to leave it in the hands of the ecb and reg dickason because from my position im completely uninformed on it
3785263 i cant make an informed decision on it so im just happy to be told what to do in this situation
3785264 inside my head i have a few thoughts about it but ill just wait to see what everybody else comes out with first and see where i stand
3785265 hey das hat meine oma doch auch noch bis kurz vor ihrem tod
3785266 have a manner of speaking like that of perietes and yet you lose yourself out of mere timidity and cowardice you neither bear up against the tumults of a popular assembly nor prepare your body by exercise for the labor of the rostrum but suffer your parts to wither away by negligence and indolence
3785267 his hearers could not cough or look aside without loss
3785268 no train of thought is strengthened by the addition of those arguments that like camp followers swell the number and the noise without bearing a part in the organization

3785290 the gulf stream works 365 days a year allowing electricity generated from its current made available 24 7 compared with solar or wind resources there is also a possibility of using the thermal difference between warm waters nearer the surface and the very cold water at the bottom which comes from the arctic circle
3785291 there are a number of sites around the world where extracting energy from the ocean current is potentially viable
3785292 about 20 percent of the gulf stream is entrained between the florida coast and the bahamas the topography of the ocean shelf acts like a funnel guiding the current
3785293 we are taking a systems approach not simply what is funded but looking at a bigger picture this includes researching the power plant system the environment the ecology and the resources of the gulf stream

3785330 bush administration officials worried by what they saw as a series of provocative russian actions repeatedly warned georgian president mikhail saakashvili to avoid giving the kremlin an excuse to intervene in his country militarily u s officials said monday

3785332 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused

3785343 i have spoken to the manager and he wants me to stay he wants me around i am staying put unless they sunderland want me out
3785344 i have been out six months and its hard not being able to kick a ball
3785345 i miss not playing but i am not rushing my return theres no need i am taking my time and i want everything to heal properly
3785346 im looking forward to training and i want to get my body back in shape and fully fit for me thats the most important thing right now i am not thinking about anything else im keeping my fingers crossed
3785347 i dont get involved in that stuff but it would be nice to see top players come in
3785348 swallows havent made mention of my name so some people could possibly think i am still at swallows but that is not the case as i am now a free agent and looking to find a new team swallows informed me that they will not be extending my contract when i reported back for the pre season
3785349 initially i thought that they would extend my contract because they invited me back for the early part of pre season also i thought i had made a considerable contribution in the games that i got to play since arriving back in january
3785350 we are still looking at a few options and there is still a chance of him going to supersport united if they manage to sell a striker
3785351 personally i am tired of the fact that we keep winning well in africa but when we get to the outside world we cannot even win a game
3785352 i do not want to agree that we do not have a good side because we do and i do not want to keep talking about luck not being on our side because we are also tired of saying that
3785353 uche is the only injury worry we have for now and the only player who will miss the match except of course our captain ajibade omolade who stands suspended
3785354 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
3785355 riding voter discontent over high gas prices the gop has made antidrilling democrats this summers headlines
3785356 if you thought republicans were no longer the stupid party then you havent met the senators who may have just destroyed the gops biggest hope this election year the drilling issue
3785357 catholic voters of the heartland key group in electing john mccain president
3785358 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
3785359 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
3785360 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
3785361 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
3785362 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
3785363 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
3785364 we want to make sure we got our game plan set
3785365 we want to make sure the entire procedure is laid out all the personnel know what they are supposed to do
3785366 i got a phone call from my chicago based agent eddie rock saying there is a club in south africa that wants you to come on trial this weekend i spoke to the club briefly and figured a trip to south africa why not
3785367 i didnt know what to expect then we had the friendly against thanda royal zulu on sunday and it went really well
3785368 i like the guys in the team apparently i have some language learning to do in the game on sunday i could communicate right away but i also want to be able to get along with everyone off the field
3785369 they both told me that if i have an opportunity to come here it would be a good move for my career as a goalkeeper they felt id be able to make an impact right away
3785370 i am now a free agent and have my clearance in my hands which i was given last week prior to that i had been training with the reserve team in mayfair but have since stopped since i am longer part of pirates i am grateful that irvin khoza gave me a chance to play for his team pirates is in the past now
3785371 for now it doesnt really look so promising that i will get a team right away but i am holding out hope because football is my way of life which is why i am still training alone in the gym
3785372 i will have to be patient and stay hopeful because i am a free agent and can join any team at any time
3785373 i am also not playing as a foreigner as i have been here since 1996 all i want is to get a team and continue playing as i do not want to cloud my mind with thoughts of quitting as yet i am a goalkeeper and as you know goalkeepers play till a very late age
3785374 i have made contact with the ghanaian football federation to ask if they can leave him out of this one so that we can get him totally fit not just for birmingham but for their world cup qualifying campaign
3785375 this game will also afford me a chance to see the players in a game situation as i have only just come into the team and need to understand how each player responds in a game situation
3785376 unlike at club level at national level you dont have the luxury of having your players day in and day out
3785377 so one therefore has to improvise on the given circumstances but we must remain focused that our main objective is to deliver a world class team for the 2010 world cup
3785378 our pyramid scheme which was started by my predecessor carlos parreira and approved by safa must not be dismantled as it is the best model for this country
3785379 we have to merge all the hard work put together in the past 16 months to produce a team for 2010 the 2010 african cup of nations qualifiers are therefore important for us just as all the friendly games are
3785380 we learnt from our mistakes that we made against zamalek and we have been working very hard to make some corrections
3785381 these games are about keeping possession and we tended to give it away in the last game against zamalek but i have seen some improvement in that regard we were not giving away possession that much and i expect to play like that in egypt
3785382 we have played two games in which i feel we did very well and we are just expecting to improve and fight for a good result
3785383 for 150 years the relationship among the various chipman families of delaware and maryland have been misstated and misunderstood
3785384 if you do not have documentary evidence of facts and dates but they are generally accepted will you list them just the same putting a mark side of each
3785385 there have been several family histories of the chipman family a recent one being john hale chipman a chipman genealogy norwell mass 1970 which though not adequately documented is generally good

3785387 we have become a culture based on smoke and mirrors nothing is what it appears to be
3785388 the best starting point for exploring any of the topics in logic
3785389 the need is for a great foreign policy president of the quality of truman or reagan to win a long war begun by our enemies we are going to need more than an attractive but essentially empty vessel
3785390 america is no longer what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
3785391 political pollsters would like us to believe theyve got a bead on voter preference for sen barack obama and john mccain with regard to who is likely to win the presidency in novembers general election this sort of thing is of course their stock in trade
3785392 the fact remains that the 4 to 10 point leads polls have been reporting for the last month or so dont mean anything with respect to the election and are far enough within the margins for error to give pause at this stage of the game acknowledging this even the overwhelmingly pro obama
3785393 it also appears and i tend to believe this based on reader mail that some savvy individuals who had leaned toward obama actually decided to do some cursory research on the candidate
3785394 that he is not what he seems has indeed become apparent to some likely voters to these he is becoming more transparent
3785395 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky and did i mention hes black

3785410 we would argue now more than ever that its important to set a date because this is the one thing that all of the factions in iraq agree on and we need to bring them together
3785411 how to redeploy implementing a responsible drawdown of u s forces from iraq
3785412 it wont take three to four years to take the equipment out of iraq
3785413 they absolutely want americans to leave but not yet and not soon
3785414 the decline in the ranking of all u s cities is due to the weakening value of the u s dollar against most major world currencies
3785415 on the bright side the u s dollars loss of value may serve to attract globally mobile executives to business centers such as new york chicago and los angeles the difference in cost of living can be significant particularly for those executives with families
3785416 41 all men therefore praising the lord the righteous judge who had opened the things that were hid 42 betook themselves unto prayer and besought him that the sin committed might wholly be put out of remembrance besides that noble judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things that came to pass for the sins of those that were slain 43 and when he had made a gathering throughout the company to the sum of two thousand drachms of silver he sent it to jerusalem to offer a sin offering doing therein very well and honestly in that he was mindful of the resurrection 44 for if he had not hoped that they that were slain should have risen again it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead

3785425 and in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3785426 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3785427 obviously meant a lot to saakashvili personally but more importantly the message it conveyed to the georgian people in this really time of unprecedented national emergency
3785428 we should realize what is at stake here for americans
3785429 what americans should do know first of all clearly make known their intentions
3785430 it come apart i hide it when i done you never know it here just like me

3785434 the personal life of aisha a prominent muslim scholar and the wife of prophet muhammad pbuh
3785435 active members of hy foiled the conspiracy of western media to humiliate our beloved holy prophet mohammad the writer ms spillberg from huston us wrote this book without any base naming it as a historical fiction on the personality of holy prophet
3785436 but after watching the posts by our active members they have withdrawn the plans of printing it hats off for these brothers and all the members of hy may allah bless us all
3785437 i extend my hand for peace with you from all the members of husaini youth
3785438 lo the harshest of all the voices is the voice of the ass
3785439 the onus is on the muslims as the prophet asks them to walk the middle path and not extremes i urge muslims to gear themselves to think and not react if you cannot listen to the prophet then dont read the book the majority of muslims always choose the right path and they need to speak when the few extremists roar
3785440 denise called me and said i want to be able to address this book before it comes out
3785441 she felt it exoticized the history she thought it was another imposition of western ideas on muslim society
3785442 i dont want to be in the position where we are stifling speech preemptive censorship is not in our interest thats worse than even censorship were not going to silence our way out of problems
3785443 that way we are calm and rational about our response
3785444 if somebody is going to be playing in my sandbox i should know what they are doing there
3785445 part of a dialogue that has to happen in the public square
3785446 muslims dont do nuance fiction is about all the grays
3785447 people are really sensitive about their history everybody wants to define history as they see it it gets sensitive because there are social and political ramifications to the telling of history but historical fiction is a great way to kind of explore possibilities im not sure muslims are quite ready for that in terms of our history
3785448 certain aspects of the book and its approach will not be accepted by muslim readers can cause a firestorm and seriously question the validity of the characters and the accounts

3785462 there is no degradation in their protection the protection they are receiving from these vests is adequate to the task
3785463 but this mindset of suspicion is understandable in light of events that happened in the past
3785464 the price points were less than i had thought they would be
3785465 one of the mistakes we made was starting off with the best spaces first because people were unsure of how the auction process worked that meant the auction pricing on the best units moved very slowly and then locked in at a low price that became the cap for the auction
3785466 auctions are more useful when the market is at a dead halt

3785469 republicans around georgia received an invitation from ralph reed who will serve as a host of a special event for mccain at the downtown marriot marquis on aug 18
3785470 john mccain believes in a strong national defense a smaller more accountable government steady economic growth and opportunity the dignity of life and traditional values
3785471 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is willing to go to win despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept tainted money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics a maverick no more the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
3785472 i would be very surprised if he doesnt cancel the event

3785482 we need to make some adjustments before 2010 podcast feed
3785483 i think this is something that at least on a temporary basis we can look at using as a model for those hard core cases where colonias lack basic utilities
3785484 even now after his death i would say his handiwork is still there
3785485 by the time there is an official local action or state legislation is enacted the colonia will likely be completely sold
3785486 there are places out there that have meter empty there are transformers within 15 feet of the house but they cant connect
3785487 the longest it takes in mexico for them to get basic services in new colonias is two years even on properties that the people have appropriated without paying for them
3785488 here where everything is done legally so much time passes
3785489 the intent was to stop the growth of the colonias and we tried to come up with quote unquote a compromise the problem is you still have some people i dont want to say in limbo but who are still caught in a difficult situation
3785490 its not an easy job to be the wicked witch of webb county
3785491 we deal with the victims we impose the rules on the victims

3785495 when you have sun you sometimes dont have wind and vice versa
3785496 theyre pretty good renewable counterparts the generator thats running on biofuels is really there to address whatever the shortfall is
3785497 for me really green energy would be much better than established types of energy for a simple reason
3785498 green energy is something that can be obtained naturally from natural resources
3785499 the u s government federal and state still see the colonias as a residual problem a dysfunctional problem rather than a development that requires much more positive thinking and creative thinking
3785500 that is can we make electricity efficient enough to be worth it for the residents down in the valley and at the same time provide a return on investment for someone who chooses to invest in these machines
3785501 where it goes from here is up to private investment

3785527 our transportation cabinet and our entire government have been cooperating and continue to cooperate with the federal authorities into this investigation into past practices in the prior administrations transportation cabinet
3785528 i think its certainly apparent that theres been a culture of corruption surrounding the transportation cabinet in the past we are determined to turn that culture of corruption into a culture of integrity
3785529 i think you have to let the judicial process run its course but obviously there are serious allegations that will be dealt with as we go along from a civil standpoint as well as a criminal one

3785711 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
3785712 i cant leave my cat hes never been outside the house for any reason
3785713 whatever you do dont let my cat outdoors he has never been out in his life and he would not know what to do
3785714 i am having a wonderful time please let my cat out
3785715 a situation where you can try to claim full demolition of a building when in fact you are just evicting the tenants ending rent regulation and just doing renovations to the building
3785716 there is a major problem with the system when the law is left to self interpret and can be argued either way we cannot allow this issue of demolition to continue if we are going to protect affordable housing
3785717 landlords are pressured to pay their debts and make a profit
3785718 phony demolition was never the intent of the law and if allowed to continue it will deplete any availability of affordable housing in our neighborhoods its a loophole to end affordable housing
3785719 so fire came out from the presence of the lord and consumed them and they died before the lord
3785720 it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
3785721 everything was looted during the civil war marble benches and even windows
3785722 what we also lack is a place to buy locally produced kosher we have no jewish schools to teach our children prayer and hebrew
3785723 we only speak arabic we just use hebrew for prayer
3785724 we hope that this synagogue one of the largest in the arab world will be renovated later this year or in 2009
3785725 before the 1975 1990 civil war there were about 22 000 of us it was after the 1982 israeli invasion of lebanon that our presence became considerably diminished
3785726 thats exactly as if we used the term iranians to describe lebanese shiites
3785727 they do not understand that israel means nothing to us we consider it an enemy country as do all the lebanese
3785728 after 1982 very few jews went to israel and those who did didnt stay long they felt deeply lebanese
3785729 there has not been a wave of persecutions despite some incidents those jews who left are like thousands of other lebanese who fled the country in search of a better future
3785730 the jews mostly lived in major cities like beirut baalbek tripoli and sidon in perfect coexistence with other communities
3785731 many jewish expatriates still have land and do not want to sell because it would be like selling a part of themselves
3785732 is it possible to settle with the current tensions in lebanon
3785733 it was their first time here and they were having a good time
3785734 there are 100 such buildings in mumbai where anything can happen in the monsoon

3785741 para nosotros tener un casco homologado y seguro es imprescindible para realizar nuestro trabajo con seguridad

3785743 ramkissoons mother seeta khadan newton said it wasnt her daughters decision not to feed the boy

3785745 the launch of the fta is not an end in itself but a beginning of a process we need to embark on to build both productive and trade capacity improve competitiveness of our industries

3785754 actions like this will not deter us it will not silence us will not intimidate us but will only encourage us to continue with our work
3785755 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3785756 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3785757 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3785758 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3785759 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3785760 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3785761 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3785762 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital

3785764 well why do you baptize babies in the catholic church
3785765 well this has helped me to become a better student and a better apostle when it comes to scripture that they will be moved to give copies to their friends and family and this is a kind of book that certainly that you can give to anyone of any age but in particular for high school and college students or for people who are newly married and people going through different situations in life where they need the advice that god has given us in sacred scripture
3785766 always be ready to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you but do it with gentleness and respect
3785767 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world

3785788 splendido non solo siamo genitori abbiamo anche il diritto di occuparci di pannolini
3785789 poco importa la fascia di et o che i figli non siano pi adolescenti ribelli ma adulti realizzati i genitori esprimono comunque un senso di infelicit superiore a quello di persone senza prole
3785790 laltra grande sorpresa emersa dai dati raccolti che entrambi i genitori attraversano delle fasi di depressione molto pi frequententemente delle coppie senza figli
3785791 la nascita di un figlio trasforma radicalmente la relazione di coppia provocando una profonda crisi
3785792 nella coppia moderna si stabilita una certa parit di ruoli che larrivo di un figlio sconvolge i ruoli diventano sessuati gli amanti si trasformano da uomo e donna in mamma e pap con chiari rimandi e uninevitabile identificazione ai propri genitori
3785793 con il primo figlio si pu ancora vivere lillusione di essere semplicemente una coppia con beb che ci si porta dietro a feste cene gite con gli amici quando arriva il secondo bambino si installa invece definitivamente il nucleo familiare con listituzione di ruoli rigidi e definiti cos nella nostra societ profondamente individualistica e narcisistica la famiglia diventa prigione
3785794 il livello di gioia coniugale cala drasticamente alla nascita del primo figlio
3785795 e risale solo quando lultimogenito andato a vivere per conto suo ma il livello generale di felicit resta comunque inferiore a quello espresso da coppie senza figli
3785796 if the governments statutory construction is correct and the computer fraud amp abuse act criminalizes violating a website terms of service then the statute is void for vagueness because it fails to provide warning of what is prohibited and ensures discriminatory enforcement
3785797 not so imprecise that people of common intelligence must guess at their meaning
3785798 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area the statute does not threaten to criminalize widespread conduct because the government must show that defendant acted with the requisite criminal scienter there is no risk of criminalizing innocent let alone negligent behavior
3785799 liverpool is an excellent example of a city regenerating fast with unemployment halved and increasing inward investment
3785800 in the year we celebrate being european capital of culture we should be talking up our city not doing it down
3785801 this is a counsel of despair and ignorance harking back to the tory days of margaret thatcher when norman lamont told people in the north to pack their bags and leave
3785802 we have made vast improvements since then and policy exchange would do better to recognise success rather than to send people down to the overcrowded south east
3785803 whereas some of the ideas such as greater devolution to local authorities and understanding real economic geography are interesting the proposals put forward by policy exchange relating to growth in cambridge lack any real substance or depth
3785804 the focus of growth and regeneration should be on what is right for each individual location not simply giving up on certain towns in the north and moving everyone down to the south
3785805 humanize john mccain as something other than a carbon copy politician running for office delivering talking points
3785806 we believe that the right to own firearms is subject to reasonable regulation but we know that what works in chicago may not work in cheyenne we can work together to enact and enforce common sense laws and improvements like closing the gun show loophole improving our background check system and reinstating the assault weapons ban so that guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists or criminals
3785807 its very emotional to think about the things these children have survived
3785808 the children had to have a big drama but had to be healthy
3785809 we are watching that segment rather than playing in it but as it matures well see where it goes at this moment we are going to focus on what we do best

3785864 this was not the most impressive display from chelsea it was a hard fought win on a bitterly cold afternoon in the north east but you cannot play derby every week and you get
3785865 if this was a triumph for jonathan woodgate tottenham and juande ramos who has been at white hart lane less than four months it was a catastrophe for chelseas regime under avram grant
3785866 chelsea yet again paced themselves beautifully to stay in step with manchester united
3785867 michael essiens first half goal brought chelsea a merited win to move them to within two points of manchester united albeit having played a game more and the resilience that thwarted a late revival from david
3785868 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim

3785881 america changed me a lot i became greedy it was all about wants and needs and thats not me as a human being thats not the kind of person i am and i didnt like the person id become i was putting myself under a lot of pressure and allowing past failures and things like that to control the moment instead of just expressing myself like i used to be able to id lost that especially as a performer i was half the singer i used to be

3785888 a lot of home chefs want to learn new skills but don
3785889 the mentor program like the rest of bakespace preserves the age old tradition of gathering in the kitchen to prepare food share skills and socialize on bakespace great recipes are just the beginning of the journey
3785890 the recipe feed does more than just satisfy your craving for great recipes
3785891 our members are as unique and diverse as the recipes they post on the site and most want their profiles to reflect their personality
3785892 to make these kind of comments against a group of people who are so loving and so caring i was very very offended by that
3785893 we need to go together forward not by spreading hate but by understanding and building bridges
3785894 people can get hurt when they get into a hot car
3785895 theyll think ill just sit on the seat but theyll get actual second degree burns if theyre wearing bathing suits or shorts
3785896 on a 90 degree day in a couple of hours your car can get up to 180 degrees inside
3785897 ive done cookies and theyre edible theyll actually cook up as if you put them in the oven
3785898 they brown up and everything on a little metal tray and youll actually have a meal when you come back ive done bacon which is really disgusting and it actually cooked it crispy and also ive done eggs frying an egg is not a problem
3785899 id say most drivers are not aware of it if its hot they might crack the window a little bit or leave their sun roof open a little bit but i think thats where it ends
3785900 think about anything you might leave in your car like lipstick or cds weve seen cds actually melt while in the radio
3785901 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
3785902 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
3785903 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon
3785904 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3785905 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3785906 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3785907 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3785908 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3785909 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama
3785910 we want proper acts on this show people who have been on the circuit for a long time and who want to showcase their talent i feel there is no place for these people on television at the moment and what i want to do is create a platform where we can have traditional good old fashioned entertainment brought back on to tv
3785911 just the very fact that i have myspace makes them think well maybe we can talk to this guy and open the lines of communication said turner who teaches english at south middle school in joplin missouri
3785912 i realized this is a major way of communication for them
3785913 you cant argue with people whose intentions are trying to protect children but the simple fact is you take these people who prey on children and they are going to find a way to do it whether its over facebook or not
3785914 there are so many kids who are stubborn against anything teachers say who are struggling in the classroom and refuse to ask for help
3785915 when its so hard to reach these kids why would you remove any of the weapons at your disposal to make a difference
3785916 as an educator there is a line of demarcation between you and your student
3785917 its a line that you cannot come close to let alone step over
3785918 its a sad thing but with teaching you are going to have people who are attracted to the profession because of easy availability of kids
3785919 those predators are going to be there but most of the time there are warning signs and thats what we need to be working on getting those people out not stopping teachers who havent caused problems from reaching those who need help most
3785920 theres something about an office with a desk in the middle of the room thats just hot
3785921 when i wear this bra i feel beautiful and when i feel beautiful i am beautiful

3785927 the bush administration yesterday proposed a regulatory overhaul of the endangered species act to allow federal agencies to decide whether protected species would be imperiled by agency projects eliminating the independent scientific reviews that have been required for more than three decades
3785928 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3785929 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3785930 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3785931 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3785932 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3785933 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3785934 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3785935 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3785936 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3785937 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3785938 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3785939 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3785940 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3785941 another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3785942 i believe it is illegal and if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3785943 mark r warner the former virginia governor and a candidate for the u s senate will deliver the keynote address the second night of the democratic national convention in denver democratic party officials announced wednesday
3785944 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving obama campaign manager david plouffe wrote in a statement early this morning
3785945 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3785946 obamas concerns and support his detailed economic plan to grow the economy create jobs restore fairness and expand opportunity
3785947 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
3785948 his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country
3785949 if john mccains campaign operatives were looking for strategic advice for the fall campaign against barack obama they could click on the atlantic monthlys web site
3785950 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3785951 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3785952 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3785953 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3785954 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3785955 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3785956 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3785957 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3785958 i dont remember there being a real discussion about this
3785959 it was universally rejected and in fairness to mark i dont think mark pushed it
3785960 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

3785987 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offense and undermine respect for the law
3785988 during the alpha test phase testers will be focused into specific towns so we can have miniature stress tests each week they will be able to experience all of our game systems including missions combat crafting scavenging economy and vehicles we are extremely excited to move from general content creation to game balance and bug fixing
3785989 it will be a bunfight and cause a huge amount of stress among some families
3785990 i am extremely pleased justice has finally been done its been a long battle
3785991 but i am about to demolish one or two bottles of red tonight because it has taken such a long time
3785992 i can tell you i and my colleagues have been very frustrated by bureaucrats in canberra who would not believe the words of the people who fought in the battle
3785993 there was enough evidence gathered at long tan to raise serious issues as to whether injustices had been done in the awarding of gallantry medals
3785994 we didnt feel free in our terms of reference to recommend the setting aside of foreign awards guidelines
3785995 i have seen on a number of occasions since sig mccarthys death the failure due to mechanical problems of the lone aero medical evacuation capability then witnessed the unacceptable amount of time it takes to get ame support from kandahar airfield
3785996 the minimum safe level of ame capability required at tarin kowt is two dedicated helicopters anything less is unnecessarily exposing our soldiers to the same or greater delay which did sig mccarthy no favours
3785997 would you be happy with that delay if it were your son
3785998 im advised that the two recent events are the first time the ready availability of medivacs has come into question
3785999 we will keep medivac capacity under review but defence is not yet convinced of any systemic problem that would justify a significant increase in australias contribution in afghanistan
3786000 we should not be accepting this we should make a noise about it to nato or provide our own solution
3786001 on your last visit to tarin kowt you are on record as saying to the two special forces soldiers as they lay wounded in their beds you can be sure that from your government you will get all the training and protection capability and kit you need to do your job effectively and as safely as possible did you really mean what you said or were you merely mouthing platitudes in front of soldiers who had risked their lives
3786002 what were saying is well do our best to pass as much of any rate cut as we can
3786003 the new reality is that movements in cash rates set by central banks are no longer a reasonable guide to the cost of bank funding
3786004 that means there is no reason for the banks not to pass through any change from the cash rate
3786005 if you are a bank generating significant profits and the commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families working australians who are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3786006 pass on in full reductions in official interest rates as and when they occur
3786007 we will assess it at the time of any rate cut
3786008 as older less expensive funding is maturing and being replaced with new more expensive funding the average cost of funds the money that banks have borrowed on domestic and international markets to lend their customers is increasing

3786013 with the goal of demilitarising the zone next to the conflict and guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population russian peacekeepers are removing these vehicles and munitions
3786014 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3786015 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3786016 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3786017 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3786018 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3786019 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3786020 for revealing iranian presidents overpriced dogs that his security team uses

3786029 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3786030 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3786031 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3786032 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag

3786038 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
3786039 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
3786040 how can john mccain say hell reduce the influence of special interests in washington when hes so fully dependent on lobbyists and their clients to finance his campaign
3786041 all candidates need to raise money but is this exemplary of a candidate who claims hell tackle the special interests

3786081 i am surprised if i was in their position i would be playing
3786082 its hard to criticise them at this point though because if they come out the next two weeks and make the side then it was a great decision not to play here
3786083 there are some young fellas but theres still quite a few guys whove played over 50 caps here
3786084 its up to all of us to make sure that the guys who havent been here before are relaxed and understand what theyre in for and that well help them out
3786085 i think the best way to lead is to get out there and get your performance right and thats what the senior players have got to do

3786088 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako

3786090 noong time na yun kasi bago tawagin ang pangalan ko nagre reminisce na ako yung pinagdaanan ko
3786091 yung sa umpisa pa lang ng auditions hanggang sa competition na mismo lahat ng mga sakripisyo talagang nagpa flashback na lang siya sa mind ko pati yung mga taong i have worked with sa gma 7 sobrang na touch ako sa naitulong talaga nila sa akin
3786092 i stopped nga for this mabigat sa loob ko yung sakripisyong yon pero alam ng parents ko isa rin ito sa mga pangarap ko sa buhay ang ganitong opportunities minsan lang talaga dumarating
3786093 para sa judges it can be too emotional so kailangang ilagay ko sa tama
3786094 sa voice quality iba talaga ang voice ko kung ikukumpara kina jayann at ram ang voice ko is husky but i can still hit high notes more on husky side na parang jaya sabi nga nila yung boses ko raw panlalaki mababa ang register pero kayang mapaglaruan para tumaas
3786095 pianist ang father ko and at the same time a politician mayroon din siyang pangarap e sabi niya magre retire na raw siya so ako na lang ang magpapatuloy sa dream na yun buong pamilya namin mahilig sa music

3786097 kung pamimiliin ka naman kasi dalawa na lang yung pipiliin mo and i guess its kids opinion lahat naman may opinyon
3786098 wala rin naman silang magagawa kung maraming tao rin ang nagkakagusto sa akin respetuhin na lang sana nila yung paniniwala ng ibang tao
3786099 dyusko ano ba yan may talent naman ako hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako narating ko naman ito siguro dahil i have shown my talent
3786100 nang mag join ako rito alam ko nang mabi bring up ang ganyang issue lalo kung marami ang sumusuporta sa akin sa text votes my dad din kasi is a politician at alam natin kapag ganyan may impression na sa politicians pagdating sa kampanyahan parang gagamitin lang ang powers para makuha yung gusto pero naipapakita ko naman ang magagawa ko at ang talent ko kaya siguro marami rin ang sumusuporta naipapakita ko naman kahit paano di ba

3786112 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3786113 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3786114 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3786115 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3786116 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3786117 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

3786123 they didnt let them have too long of a run and i think the largest lead they had was four points
3786124 that is one thing we are working on not let anyone have too many long runs on us
3786125 they can i know we went down in three games but i see a lot of good things going on out there we are just lacking some communication and i think confidence i think as soon as we gather some confidence within this team and find some leaders have some leaders step up in leadership roles i think we will be someone to reckon with

3786146 the fact that market prospects are still uncertain means that it is almost impossible to make reliable forecasts
3786147 demand at most divisions remains very strong particularly in the u s

3786302 display the names of our employees including their phone number and id number and list them by last name and first name
3786303 the sequence is important because your database system will evaluate the columns in the order by clause from left to right also the importance of the sequence grows in direct proportion to the number of columns you use always sequence the columns in the order by clause properly so that the result sorts in the appropriate order note the database products from microsoft microsoft office access and microsoft sql server include an interesting extension that allows you to request a subset of rows based on your order by clause by using the top keyword in the select clause for example you can find out the five most expensive products in the sales orders database by requesting select top 5 productname retailprice from products order by retailprice desc the database sorts all the rows from the products table descending by price and then returns the top five rows both database systems also allow you to specify the number of rows returned as a percentage of all the rows for example you can find out the top 10 percent of products by price by requesting select top 10 percent productname retailprice from products order by retailprice desc in fact if you want to specify order by in a view sql server requires that you include the top keyword if you want all rows you must specify top 100 percent for this reason youll see that all the sample views in sql server that include an order by clause also specify top 100 percent there is no such restriction in microsoft access saving your work save your select statements every major database software program provides a way for you to save them saving your statements eliminates the need to recreate them every time you want to make the same request to the database when you save your select statement assign a meaningful name that will help you remember what type of information the statement provides and if your database software allows you to do so write a concise description of the statements purpose the value of the description will become quite clear when you havent seen a particular select statement for some time and you need to remember why you constructed it in the first place a saved select statement is categorized as a query in some database programs and as a view function or stored procedure in others regardless of its designation every database program provides you with a means to execute or run the saved statement and work with its result set note for the remainder of this discussion well use the word query to represent the saved select statement and execute to represent the method used to work with it sql queries for mere mortals a hands on guide to data manipulation in sql 2nd edition using the order by clause of the select query in sql how to use the select statement in sql

3786371 faced with the risk of serious and irreversible damages we cannot wait until we have all the scientific evidence before taking measures this is why the principle of precaution states that the absence of certainty must not delay action
3786372 electronic fog sometimes called electrosmog is suspected of provoking or promoting cancer or other illnesses but most people consider that the producers of electricity or electrical equipment cannot be held responsible as long as a direct link of causality has not been scientifically established namely evidence that low frequency electro magnetic fields have a harmful impact on the human organism this publication reaches the opposite conclusion it shows that we must from now on based on current knowledge expect that judges find in favour of the claimants
3786373 if these interests triumph the third party liability complaints present or future concerning electro magnetic fields could terminate in favour of the claimants and have fatal consequences for insurance companies we can already expect phenomenal expense costs
3786374 concretely insurance companies must endeavour to control the risks resulting from the past and conceive a creative and united method of controlling future third party risks the first and most urgent measure to be taken is to limit its own damages for the insurance companies that means re examining existing contracts
3786375 it would be desirable if for their part industry were to understand that the insurance companies cannot assume any risk whatever

3786381 i intend to kill them as quickly and painlessly as possible
3786382 but fiu is private property we cannot let you take this iguana off the premises until you get permission from the general counsel
3786383 we cannot condone or allow the activity of hunting iguanas on our property
3786384 might be able to give permission to kill one of them

3786410 a lot of artists make two or three really great songs for an album and the rest just fill up space
3786411 the internet makes competition more fair because people have the freedom to tune in or out something you cant do under the radio payola system
3786412 it also takes you back to the days of word of mouth where friends tell other friends and where you have to fight to be heard that forces you to be a better musician
3786413 coming to my house was like showing up at a workshop
3786414 i couldnt even get a bite of food in my mouth without my parents telling me to belt out a number
3786415 my toughest judges are members of my own family even now i cant take a song out of that house unless its gotten high marks
3786416 growing up under this kind of magical critique is the very thing that helps to open the heart and the senses
3786417 i went in as a kid and i came out as a man

3786424 a lot of people around me said i got black balled because of my past
3786425 i was actually hoping for everybody to be in full pads and thinking we were going to hit this morning
3786426 when the weather hit like it did we had them convinced we were going to come over here and do a walk through in ramsey like we normally do on a rain day we stretched a little bit and i told them we wanted to get nice and flexible so nobody pulled a hamstring off the high dive they got the picture
3786427 come on nick lets go we dont have all day
3786428 i didnt think it would be a good idea to go in there and jump around on the foot
3786429 i got my head right for the worst when they told me we were going to the pool i was shocked i think the guys needed a rest because weve got a lot of injured players
3786430 to really understand where you are as an artist sometimes you have to be among regular people at the clubs you dont encounter old people or the working class
3786431 i came back and it was a totally new miami
3786432 the depression really brings out the best in people we get closer together as a community and we start realizing its not about making money its about making art
3786433 one of the reasons i started the label was because there were so many good bands here that i would see playing all the time and most of them had never released anything
3786434 so it seemed to make sense to put it all under one roof and start putting some records out we put on a lot of shows for touring bands in detroit too and sometimes it can be tough to get people to come out that has been improving in the past year though
3786435 i began growing my beard in 2004 and realized that in the current political climate i couldnt even grab a cab with my beard
3786436 the beard itself became a symbol of power i was listening to zz top with jim fletcher my longtime collaborator and we decided the band offered an interesting way to approach beard dom

3786445 guys basically just want to get laid and they forget about pleasing the woman women are usually let down and thats where fetishes come in if you spank a woman on her pussy she is going to love it especially if her ass is in the air and you hit it right on the clitoris thats why women are so attracted to me
3786446 i can get them off better than any man because i go way beyond that plain old fuck
3786447 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life

3786454 they are using private money for the project and besides talking to the residents of the area there is no guarantee that legacy l a will always have the best interest of the community in mind or reflect what the community wants
3786455 the details have yet to be worked out but legacy l a will be in a partnership with recreation and parks but rec and parks will retain ownership of the actual property
3786456 legacy l a began as an umbrella to house local community organizations
3786457 but the program has evolved and now we plan to provide services to the community
3786458 contrary to some fringe opinions the board is not uniformly filled with supporters of one group over another
3786459 there was a lot of painstaking effort to ensure it included a fair mix of people and it obviously includes community members again the whole basis of the program is to promote community ideas and community support and that will continue throughout the duration once the community decides what programs it wants
3786460 by the time employees vote in a national labor relations board sponsored election the environment has been so poisoned that free and fair choice isnt an option

3786464 so of the six months between early august and early february golds massive seasonal autumn rally fully four are golds biggest months of the calendar year you absolutely want to be long gold and indeed the entire pm complex since everything pm related ultimately follows golds lead in september november december and january seasonal demand driven price increases are very compelling then obviously this is really exciting today since we are now on the verge of golds biggest seasonal rally of the year but remember that seasonals are a tailwind a secondary indicator so if gold was overbought today and greed abounded the bullish seasonals could easily be overridden but thankfully it is not indeed just the opposite has occurred gold is deeply oversold today and sentiment is horrendous excessive levels of both fear and frustration have conspired to create an explosively bullish sentiment mixture

3786476 sequential treatment with dox doxorubicin followed by zol zoledronic acid elicited substantial antitumor effects in subcutaneous breast tumors in vivo in the absence of bone disease
3786477 our work using a model system has shown that treatment with the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin followed by zoledronic acid kills breast tumours
3786478 may benefit the most if these two drugs are given in this particular order
3786479 the results of a large breast cancer trial later this year to confirm our findings this method of treatment could then quickly be incorporated into clinical practice
3786480 the results of this study are very encouraging and could change the way breast cancer patients are treated the good news is the two treatments used in this study are relatively inexpensive and already used in the clinic therefore we should quickly see the benefits giving women the best possible chance of beating breast cancer
3786481 antitumor effects of doxorubicin followed by zoledronic acid in a mouse model of breast cancer
3786482 may increase their risk behaviors due to factors such as loneliness isolation separation from partners which can result in new partners drug use and inadequate access to health care
3786483 aggressively confronting the epidemic among latinos is one of cdcs highest hiv prevention priorities prevention efforts must be designed to reach a multi ethnic latino population
3786484 until they are very very sick and once diagnosed they dont take their medicine as prescribed even when they have access to life extending medicines
3786485 sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine
3786486 from there we can develop means to build trust and better communicate the value of medical treatment to hispanics with hiv and preventive methods for those at risk of contracting hiv
3786487 add homelessness mental illness or drug addiction into the mix and taking much needed medication falls from the top of the priority list
3786488 we dont know to what extent ongoing drug use interferes or affects the medication they take but crack or heroin interferes with adherence
3786489 theyre more than just an hiv infected person or a person using crack every day or a homeless person these are problems no one can manage by themselves these folks have struggled their whole lives
3786490 on paper they look good but hiv dementia and other problems have set in and even though newer medication has people living longer lives most of our residents probably wont ever go and live on their own
3786491 its hard to know the specific reasons why people abandon treatment but there are lots of patients with low weight and nutrition problems
3786492 visibly weak those who come from families with no possessions and those who are too feeble to work
3786493 talking about nutrition in mozambique is extremely complex because the question of lack of food does not only affect hiv positive patients
3786494 should serve as a wake up call from the aids amnesia surrounding the domestic epidemic in recent years
3786495 desperately needs the same kind of leadership and commitment at home that our country has shown
3786496 progressive policies are urgently needed that recognize hiv aids as an emergency in america as well as overseas

3786500 children are losing their benefits under this punitive policy change
3786501 clearly the children who are most negatively impacted are children who have the most serious health care needs
3786502 improving health and promoting healthy behaviors are laudable goals but restricting health care coverage for infants and children is not the way to achieve them
3786503 monitoring our enrollment data to gauge the long term success of implementation
3786504 an oversimplification of whats happening with the medicaid program and we truly wish they would have called to ask us about it
3786505 mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents globally have received little research attention even though mental health problems are one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease
3786506 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3786507 no changes were found on the other outcome variables traumatic idioms depressive anxiety symptoms and functioning the latter for boys we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3786508 in short a school based psychosocial intervention was able to moderately reduce ptsd symptoms retain hope and improve functioning for girls and retain hope for boys affected by communal violence in a low income context
3786509 further adaptations and research to address the full range of post traumatic outcomes and functioning are necessary

3786514 i was just trying to defend myself and the shop i work from 9am until we close at 10 30pm seven days a week
3786515 i took my hands up and said go ahead and take everything
3786516 if i did some damage to him then id get in trouble too
3786517 i think we did pretty well you cant let him get away with a little knife
3786518 to consume 10 000 calories a day he would need to be eating all day long
3786519 athletes need fat but they need to be selective about the type of fat and whenever possible choose unsaturated fats such as olive or canola oil avocados nuts and seeds
3786520 trouble just peed and pooped all over my clothes that i left on the floor
3786521 not only that but he was sick in the living room kitchen and laundry room
3786522 and here they release two separate reports on the same day with a variance in data

3786525 give us one set of rules and well play by it
3786526 then they released two separate reports on the same day the superintendent from yonkers gave a lunchtime talk on the first data only to return to his office to find the second set of percentages

3786538 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3786539 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3786540 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3786541 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3786542 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded

3786552 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3786553 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3786554 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3786555 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3786556 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3786562 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3786563 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3786564 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3786565 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3786566 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3786567 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3786568 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3786597 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3786598 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
3786599 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3786600 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3786601 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3786602 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements

3786612 at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him

3786622 he made his pitches but it was a tough game for us

3786786 around 10 000 people joined the procession that took his coffin draped in a palestinian flag to a hilltop grave oh mahmoud oh mahmoud you rest and we will continue the struggle mourners chanted as the poet was buried a helicopter had brought his body from jordan where it had been flown from the united states palestinian president mahmoud abbas with scores of tearful officials dignitaries and relatives of darwish received the poets flower strewn coffin at his governments ramallah headquarters
3786787 the symbol who expressed our national feeling our human constitution our declaration of independence who could offer him the lament he deserves
3786788 this is a loss of the palestinian voice the palestinian vision somehow we felt that as long as there was mahmoud darwish there was a sense of goodness a sense of hope a sense of possibility for salvation
3786789 the story of our people is your story mahmoud and by our meeting it was made more complete and more beautiful you remain with us mahmoud because you represent everything that unites us
3786790 went on to express the hope that the flag he raised so high with his poems will one day fly high over the minarets of jerusalem its churches and walls the eternal capital of our inevitable palestinian state
3786791 darwish would one day be interred in the holy city along with his iconic predecessor yasser arafat who was buried in ramallah in 2004 in a funeral attended by hundreds of thousands of people darwishs coffin draped with a palestinian flag and yellow flowers was then driven through the streets of ramallah to a burial place near the towns cultural palace

3786793 harshly critical of israel and was detained several times in the 1960s before going into self imposed exile in 1970 over the next 25 years he lived briefly in paris moscow and several arab capitals
3786794 about his experience of life in beirut during the israeli invasion and bombardment of lebanon in 1982 in a work that was translated into english in 1995 under the title memory for forgetfulness darwish served on the executive committee of arafats plo until 1993 when he resigned in protest at the oslo autonomy accords
3786795 follow ed with fascination and sometimes skepticism darwishs political musings not least his trenchant criticism of the oslo peace process he was deeply opposed to the oslo agreement arguing that it did not offer palestinians a clear path towards statehood and did not commit israel firmly enough to ending the occupation his pessimism much to his own regret was proven right
3786796 poetry may have become a minority art form in much of the rest of the world but in the palestinian territories darwishs poems were read taught learn ed and sung everywhere his work was refined rich and complex but it was always part of the palestinian cultural mainstream darwishs public readings were big events his popularity was enhanced by the fact that he never shied away from touching upon the painful realities of present day palestinian society though he was loved by palestinian readers above all because he found the words to describe their suffering and quest for statehood darwish was far more than a political poet indeed the themes to which he returned again and again exile longing alienation resonated with readers all over the world for palestinians his death is a severe blow after edward sa d the famous literary critic and author who died five years ago they have now lost their second intellectual of world repute
3786797 darwish is gone but his struggles are not yet laid to rest
3786798 mark s the tragic loss of another legendary figure in the palestinian national movement and indeed in the cultural and intellectual life of the wider arab world darwish gave voice to the sufferings of the palestinian people under occupation and in exile while simultaneously articulating their dreams of living at peace as equal citizens in their own state conveying this dual spirit of hope and despair was a delicate balance that only a skilled poet could master darwish was both a strong critic of israeli oppression while at the same time publicly struggling to find some form of accommodation with dissident jewish israelis
3786799 were imbued with a sense that both the victims and the oppressors in the palestinian israeli conflict are destined to share the same uncertain future in which the israelis are dragging both parties toward national suicide but his efforts to engage the israeli people and dispel their racist superstitions were flatly rebuffed in fact in 2000 an israeli ministers proposal to teach darwishs works in public schools sparked a political firestorm that saw right wing lawmakers try to oust the government of then prime minister ehud barak through a no confidence vote

3787016 geothermal energy or heat from the earth is largely non polluting and is renewable and reliable
3787017 throughout the globe heat is continually produced in a layer far below the earths crust large power plants can capture and use this steam to provide electricity on a fairly large scale
3787018 in iceland by some estimates 50 of all energy needs are met through an alternative energy source that has been known for a long time
3787019 geothermal is used in many other places as well the largest system in operation is in california just north of san francisco in an area known as the geysers
3787020 efforts are also underway to use geothermal heat via hot dry rock technology rocks are broken up by pumping water through them at high pressure water is then pumped through the broken rocks so that it can be heated by the earths energy
3787021 finally geothermal energy also can be tapped through ground source heat pumps effective in heating and cooling individual buildings this approach takes advantage of the fact that just five to 10 feet below the ground there is a constant temperature of around 50 degrees f
3787022 right now the u s has nearly 3 000 megawatts mw of installed geothermal energy capacity and is the global leader in total geothermal electric power production
3787023 over the next five to 10 years capacity should grow by at least 20 a year three companies are particularly well positioned to lead this growth starting with chevron
3787024 while oil of course is its main focus chevron is the worlds largest geothermal energy producer with facilities that include two plants in indonesia and two in the philippines the companys huge capital base gives it the wherewithal to fund continued research and installations
3787025 with 2007 representing chevrons fourth consecutive year of record earnings the company is a strong pick for many reasons making it a safe way to get in on geothermals expected expansion
3787026 a riskier play is calpine corp the primary producer of geothermal energy in north america its the operator of the huge geothermal facilities at the geysers which meet nearly 70 of the average electrical demand for californias north coast region
3787027 calpine created in 1984 grew rapidly in its first two decades aggressively purchasing natural gas fields and gas turbine plants as well as moving into geothermal energy and by 2001 it was the worlds ninth largest producer of electricity
3787028 in 2005 however it filed for bankruptcy as its aggressive leveraged expansion efforts foundered in the wake of californias energy crisis of the early 2000s and enrons collapse early this year the company emerged from bankruptcy with its old shares canceled and new stock issued
3787029 finally the pure play geothermal company with the best defined growth prospects is ormat technologies its the second largest producer of geothermal electricity in the u s which accounts for around 75 of the companys revenues
3787030 its 11 geothermal power plants produce an average of 32 mw per year per plant and it has a further 270 mw of capacity in various stages of development
3787031 ormat is a leader not only in geothermal energy but also in recovered energy power generation which refers to the capturing of waste heat generated from industrial processes and converting it into electricity
3787032 ormats reputation is built on its pioneering work the company owns more than 75 patents and has the sectors leading technology and on the fact that it designs and makes most of the equipment it uses further boosting its importance within the sector
3787033 revenues grew 12 4 in the most recent quarter vs the like year earlier period while earnings per share of 24 cents were above expectations and while the p e at 30 is relatively high the companys expected rapid growth gives it a peg of just 1 2
3787034 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3787035 we have warned of the pa turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction
3787036 in other words a peace process that undermined palestinian democracy created a peace partner fatah so hated by its own people that the israeli army must now protect them
3787037 where is the money that was supposedly spent on reforming the judicial system where is the international outrage as palestinian leaders drag their own society further into the abyss
3787038 the appalling fact only fitfully reported in north america is that the two major palestinian factions are committed to an often murderous conflict
3787039 rather than a model for a future palestinian state gaza looks like somalia broken and ravenous
3787040 my priority is to campaign against anwar and i support any candidate picked by bn
3787041 electrification works start first before signalling and communication systems are set up
3787042 with oil prices rising and environmental issues cropping up there will be demand for cleaner form of transportation
3787043 weve been invited to view some rail electrification projects in mumbai india and saudi arabia
3787044 we already controlled about 70 share of the door sets and moulding market
3787045 we hope to form a joint venture company in india by end of this year
3787046 eight wins is not acceptable our coaching staff has let us know that and the players really believe in that
3787047 we definitely knew going into the offseason that we were going to work a little harder trying to get ready for this season because were not going to let that happen again
3787048 it probably was a little bit of a distraction and a little bit of a roller coaster not only for the players but the coaches because youre handling a lot of things in between football that you normally wouldnt be talking about at the same time
3787049 we kinda got back to the mindset of hey we gotta go out and have fun playing this because i think there was a lot of people who were mentally and physically tired because of everything we went through
3787050 its a difference between a saturday scrimmage where i would have had it off and would have been able to sit for five hours and evaluate it i was flying down to blakes hometown to talk to him about it when youve got 29 practices to get ready for a ballgame and you need every minute you can
3787051 one thing i like about this team is that we dont have a couple superstars
3787052 last year we had tommy blake and chase ortiz and both of them were tremendous football players i think this year were more of just a blue collar go out work hard play hard kind of team i think that suits us a lot better
3787053 it kind of feels like the same way when we came off my freshman year in 2004 when we went 5 6 and i was redshirting
3787054 it feels the same the chemistry is real good everybody understands now that the seasons not always going to be 11 2 or 11 1 for us to get there we kinda have to work at it
3787055 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

3787059 though agricultural commodity prices have moderated they remain quite favorable by historical standards and are continuing to provide strong support to farm incomes and to the sale of productive farm machinery worldwide
3787060 whats more deeres entire business lineup is benefiting from the consistent execution of our plans to rigorously manage costs and assets and create a more resilient company overall
3787061 our non agricultural operations have remained on a profitable course as a result in spite of the economic downturn in the united states

3787063 it is my favorite movie i want to meet a guy like that mandy and shane looked great together
3787064 omg i have never cried so much ever i love this film and will do untill i die i think its so sad and just really heartwarming i love the soundtrack and the book as well as the film i love it xx
3787065 i think it is verrrrrrrry wonderful and magnificent in addition shane west is very charming and goood looking
3787066 a walk t remember is a wonderful film it has drama romance and suspence it is a beautiful story and the actors are great
3787067 a film to remember shocking great i love it it is one of the best films i ve ever seen and the best lovestory i ve ever heard about it s just fantastic actors soundtrack every single detail was great chosen and prepared i loved the soundtrack it made the film even better that it would have been without music
3787068 were not ever really with people cause were always traveling
3787069 and you get on the phone and theyre like my day is awful blah and youre like this is not what i need right now
3787070 this is hard but if they are nagging and annoying youre like go away
3787071 we are secret agents and our cover is that were a band
3787072 everyone knew it was going to be about spies and thats changed a little bit i guess cause in the course of the last two years the band has changed a little bit were going to be the jonas brothers going through life like going to school but still being the jonas brothers
3787073 i love ben stiller and we met him just recently
3787074 it was weird writing a song talking about a boy
3787075 we were like so this is what girls go through
3787076 weve come to this level for the pure love and joy of the sport
3787077 anything above that is a bonus but i think its excellent for the next generation of athletes that we would have this kind of incentive program
3787078 it just seemed that this was a mark that was sustainable
3787079 its not one where we would throw these great numbers out there and then all of a sudden get to the next games and not be able to reward them
3787080 what we first and foremost said is that wed like it to be equal a medal should be a medal
3787081 our number one priority was to make sure we rewarded every individual medal the same way whether it came from an individual or a team
3787082 we want to retain those particular athletes as long as we can
3787083 not only to hopefully win more medals but more importantly to have younger athletes learn from them
3787084 we need to help those who are breaking onto the scene
3787085 i think that money should maybe be allocated somewhere else until we have a bigger pot
3787086 in a lot of cases its several years out that theyre looking at identifying those athletes and making sure theyre being brought through that whole cycle
3787087 i think its an important step just in terms of culture in canada to say that we are going to value medals beyond just a pat on the back
3787088 i think that until we sort of say that we can be winners and we expect to be winners which is what offering those incentives does i think that were not going to be the number one nation in 2010 or beyond
3787089 its maybe not the numbers that people would like it to be
3787090 but i think its a step in the right direction
3787091 with team sports and everything else it was difficult to find numbers that made sense and wasnt going to be unrealistic
3787092 i was surprised at how willing people were to have that discussion

3787098 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past

3787110 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3787111 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3787114 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3787115 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3787116 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3787117 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3787118 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3787119 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3787120 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3787121 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3787122 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3787123 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3787124 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3787125 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3787126 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3787127 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3787128 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3787129 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

3787136 confessed during an interrogation that the georgian army had left behind a large number of dead and wounded soldiers as it was retreating
3787137 we refuse to maintain any relations with georgias treacherous and criminal regime
3787138 the georgians pulled out and the russians should stop fighting as well
3787139 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3787140 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3787141 we think crysis warhead is going to offer a tremendous experience to a wide range of gamers

3787145 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3787146 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3787147 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3787148 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3787156 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3787157 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3787158 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3787159 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3787160 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3787161 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3787162 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3787163 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3787164 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3787165 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3787166 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3787167 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3787168 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3787169 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3787170 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3787171 very happy at rangers and the supporters are one of the reasons i want to stay here for many years
3787172 we dont have to sell the player or any player at this stage
3787173 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3787174 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3787175 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3787176 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3787177 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3787178 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3787179 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3787180 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3787181 if the best defense is a good offense then i am more than willing to offend my enemies
3787182 if signed into law ab 2567 will mean an official day commemorating homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality in california government schools
3787183 democrat programs are so wonderful that they have to force you to use them
3787184 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
3787185 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this

3787189 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3787190 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3787191 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3787192 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3787193 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3787194 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3787195 the courage to be able to tell the prime minister when he needs to change direction
3787196 i am not commenting on that issue as i made clear at the outset it is not about that
3787197 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3787198 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3787199 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3787200 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3787251 you know how you see a show car and its really cool and then four years later you see the production car and it sucks and you go what happened they had it they had it in the palm of their hands they grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory
3787252 what happened was the designers came up with this really great idea then they take it to the engineers and the engineers go nah we cant do that thats impossible and so it gets a lot worse then they take it to the manufacturing people and they go we cant build that and it gets a lot worse
3787253 apple makes me want to drive my car into a wall

3787259 i understand your concerns and try to do whatever i can to find solutions to issues involving non muslims we are brothers and sisters who must work together and continue practising tolerance and patience as a way forward for this nation
3787260 when we are friends between muslims and the non muslims it is easy to work things out
3787261 for me justice for all is the most important thing it is the command of allah to be trustworthy in executing my duties the people have trusted me and expect me to deliver

3787263 yes a lot of people have told me that i look like benazir i think it is a compliment people in my constituency seem to think so
3787264 i take it as a compliment and sometimes i take advantage of it
3787265 previously for all the important issues of the country the decisions were made outside parliament now for the first time land energy water and poverty issues have been brought to parliament it was never that way before
3787266 i declared the appointment of the opposition leader on the first day of parliament because i believe that the opposition is important to parliament
3787267 up till now they have done so im a familiar face in parliament
3787268 previously the men have been known to use unparliamentary language but whenever they do i remind them to use the proper language
3787269 there is no urgency it is a sure win for anwar
3787270 there were many police reports on fights and intimidation lodged during the last general election which i helped to settle
3787271 we are used to intense political battle already we first experienced it in 1998
3787272 i had to bring mohd shuhaimi shopping as he wanted to choose his food
3787273 im worried that he would ask my parents for money they are also poor and dependent on my other siblings
3787274 adiks school is nearer to my parents home in bukit bayroute he has to attend football training every day this week
3787275 he can finish up to three plates of rice for lunch and dinner i have to buy extra food or else my parents will send him back to us
3787276 adiks favourite food is fried chicken and sambal tumis i will go to my parents home every two or three days
3787277 the towkay is the owner of the boat that i am using to catch fish he will deduct the money i borrow from the cost of fish which i sell to him
3787278 the poor boy ate only bread and oatmeal for a few days because he was really ill when he asked for bak kut teh i decided he could have some
3787279 it would be a waste of money if we cannot finish the drinks we can always order more if theres not enough
3787280 we are lucky we dont need to pay any more for our house and car we just overhauled our subaru e10 minivan so whatever money we save from groceries will have to go to the mechanic
3787281 i wake up in the middle of the night to switch off the air conditioner
3787282 if i am called for investigations i will answer the charges
3787283 people are using restaurants very differently these days as lifestyles have changed weve really had to contemporize and create modern relevant in restaurant experiences
3787284 we did it because we thought it was going to be something nice something with no problem
3787285 but somebody wants to talk about it it is too much of a big deal with you guys the media and everybody talking about that
3787286 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it just because to me it was a little clownish for our part to be doing that
3787287 but the sponsors insisted and insisted i think it is just a bad idea i guess to do that but it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3787288 i didnt find it very funny i didnt find it offensive either i guess some guys didnt mind to me i dont want to be that way i guess to be doing that stuff
3787289 if anybody feels offended by it we totally apologize for it we never meant anything offensive by it
3787290 if i go to play with a taller team and i put here raising up on the tips of his toes it is not an offense

3787292 since it is not clear who will take over from shahrizat once she becomes the umno wanita chief rafidah should have opted to step down sometime closer to the party elections
3787293 this way members would be able to quickly decide who should take over from shahrizat
3787294 if rafidah hands over her post to shahrizat in the middle of next year the question is who is going to be the deputy wanita umno chief this is why i am saying it would be better if the change took place closer to the party polls
3787295 this is not similar to the one between datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi and his deputy datuk seri najib razak he abdullah is only handing over his position as the prime minister and not his umno presidency
3787296 i feel rafidah should have used a more democratic approach and not simply handed over the position if she wanted to avoid a contest for the top post and because of this chose to hand over her position in the middle of next year then i feel it is not very democratic

3787298 while i was down in laredo as a border sector commander having a real understanding of what border security is all about john cornyn was in washington d c doing the washington double talk
3787299 id never given much thought to how i would die
3787300 there should be a leeway for employees to take a break or have a meal outside their workplace and return to their jobs or to stop for meals on their way home
3787301 to arise out of and in the course of employment
3787302 payment is given on a monthly basis to a fund managed by socso as savings or investment for monetary assistance when there is need
3787303 is it fair for socso to find an excuse to reject the claim for disabled compensation when the monetary assistance was desperately required
3787304 if he turned right he deviated from his journey if he turned left he would be going straight home so answering the call of nature is not allowed
3787305 the media was right to do it it is unfortunate that the theft happened but it did and it is your the medias duty to report it
3787306 it was a failure on our part and we will take corrective measures
3787307 i am hurt aghast and shocked but at the same time these are the realities
3787308 my job now is clear we have to nab the culprits responsible and find the drugs
3787309 there will be no cover up the culprits will be arrested soon and the missing syabu recovered
3787310 had to seek advice from the deputy public prosecutor otherwise my statement would be considered as subjudice as the matter is related to a pending court case
3787311 do not construe our line of action as harassment reports that acid had been used to melt the padlock to the storage room is news to us
3787312 i have accepted dr wan azizahs apology even my company shares the same sentiments
3787313 i just want the whole case to cool off and i leave the rest to the police
3787314 i am not going to talk about the incident any more i just want to put it behind me
3787315 as it is foreign maids receive no such training we are doing this to see if we can create a new service area for malaysian women to work in
3787316 i am just opening up opportunities i can only offer the training it is up to them to find jobs
3787317 in the long term we want our families to be looked after by malaysian caregivers
3787318 the liberal democrats have had over 500 responses so far from people who say they are very concerned about the parks police being disbanded
3787319 we need the parks police and i think the council should lift the threat of disbandment as soon as possible
3787320 the new parkforce scheme is quite a radical change from our previous staffing and policing system and we would welcome as much feedback as possible on our proposals
3787321 these plans are all about trying to reduce crime and fear of crime in our parks
3787322 currently we have 59 primary and 24 secondary schools in the state equipped to handle students diagnosed with downs syndrome autism dyslexia as well as slow learners
3787323 wired reports that the two star general in charge of the us air forces new cyber command is
3787324 lieutenant general robert j elder jr a senior figure in us air force cyber command afcyber has told zdnet uk that
3787325 the black boxes are clearcube computer terminals and the fact that there are two of them at each station points to perhaps the most important defensive strategy of the pentagons global information grid
3787326 i want to give an assurance that structurally mrr2 has been certified safe and strong with the defects being minor
3787327 we are investigating why these straps gave way while straps on other pillars remained intact
3787328 the mrr2 project was initially undertaken by a company however when defects appeared another company was appointed to carry out repairs
3787329 were normal for contract works and there is nothing to worry as the flyover is safe
3787330 never lose yourself if you do you cant solve everything
3787331 nobody is evil they just dont know which way is right
3787332 i had no pressure at all in athens as it was my first major event however the beijing olympics will be different as it has a number of strong players especially from china and im also hoping to win a medal
3787333 although i have beaten lin dan that doesnt make me the favourite in fact there are many good players and i cannot take any match for granted
3787334 lin dan is consistent and will have home ground advantage while players from korea and indonesia are also gearing up for this special event
3787335 what is important is for me to maintain my form and forget about the rest of the factors including the rewards i know that the rm1 million reward by the government is something big but that is not my focus
3787336 i am fortunate to have misbun with me while psychologist fred tan has also offered great help in my preparations
3787337 it is a co incidence as i qualified for the athens olympics under misbun and he is back to guide me again i will be going all out and i will accept a medal of any colour
3787338 these things are beyond my control and i would like to stay away from them i will just focus on my objective in beijing
3787339 i have a tricky second round match against ronald susilo and i cannot take things for granted it is not going to be an easy run as i also have potential rivals like sony dwi kuncoro of indonesia and bao chunlai in the later stages but i will be going all out
3787340 i dont see why not the core of the team is still the same of course we had a little thing with cristiano ronaldo this summer but we have a good squad of players
3787341 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does
3787342 there will be injuries loss of form red cards and clearly we need luck at crucial times as well but hopefully we will end up in the right place
3787343 it is almost too tight to split them and results over the last few years confirm that
3787344 in the last three or four years it has been chelsea and manchester united going for the title
3787345 but liverpool won the champions league then lost the final a couple of years later arsenal have been in it as well
3787346 during these two years at chelsea i had two operations and a serious back injury
3787347 if i will have the opportunity to train and play without injuries i would like to leave my mark on the history of chelsea injuries constantly kept me out of action
3787348 i have trained with the team only a week the process of recovery is taking place normally and the injury doesnt bother me
3787349 it is gratifying that the coach gave me an opportunity to get back to the rhythm of playing
3787350 we had a good conversation im only now getting into shape and recovering from injury so preference is given to those players who are in better form
3787351 the coach always chooses the best players in order to choose the best scheme i very much respect scolari as a man and a great coach
3787352 i think the challenge for the coach now is to find the optimum team and help the players achieve their best form
3787353 its certain that the insults were racist but if lewis was bald the insults would have related to baldness
3787354 after that we will give them a clear reply this does not mean we are delaying or do not have a stand on the matter we want to give them a comprehensive answer
3787355 obviously we want ronaldo because of the quality which he has but there is a contract problem which manchester and the player have to resolve not us
3787356 i hope his recovery is good we need him out here he is obviously the best player in the world he builds a lot of excitement around events
3787357 but whether hes here or not i have a job to do and i dont really worry about the impact
3787358 this ones a little more frustrating for me im two time defending champ and not being able to get out there and defend something ive already defended once and cant do it twice its a little bit frustrating
3787359 when tiger isnt playing obviously the tv ratings are going to take a hit
3787360 the guys been the face of our tour and hes hard to replace
3787361 tigers got an injury which is going to keep him out for 10 months thats unfortunate but i think its an opportunity for a lot of people to try and take advantage of the world no 1 not being in the golf tournament
3787362 i thought it was in incredible shape today tuesday when i went out there
3787363 if you look at quite a few other clubs theyve not been able to bring in as many players as we have at this point
3787364 its a very tough league but were optimistic and at this stage the fans should be as well theres no reason why we cant have our dreams
3787365 we dont want them to be pressured especially as we have a chance of a medal in the team event you can ask me anything though
3787366 the top four will be seeded and get a bye into the second round which is the quarter finals
3787367 that will also mean that we will avoid south korea in the last eight which is important if we want to win a medal
3787368 if we get a bye into the last eight it would mean one win will take us into the semi finals and if we can again avoid korea then we have a chance of advancing into the final
3787369 we have been working on them but the phobia is still there and that is why they must finish in the top four of the ranking round
3787370 sur les lignes ant rieures au d clenchement des hostilit s
3787371 this program is plain and simple about respect respect for oneself and one another
3787372 no the government wont cut its spending on sports should we fail in beijing but if this does happen then we must realign our sights on sports that do not require physical contact or need the bare minimum
3787373 archery is an example of a sport we can do well in the teams world ranking is now fourth from seventh when i assumed the sports minister portfolio
3787374 the rise is rapid and it means we have a chance of winning a medal this wasnt the case not so long ago but one achieved because of the hard work put in
3787375 we also have to accept the fact that we are not doing well in team sports like football and hockey and one reason is the physical disadvantage
3787376 we are also looking into that a special committee for sports development has been formed and it will be chaired by me with the deputy chairmen the deputy education minister and the deputy higher education minister
3787377 we understand that we need to improve the grassroots and for that to happen we have to work with the education ministry as it controls the talent at the grassroots
3787378 im sure they are ready to do battle but they must remember that the scenario in beijing will be different realistically our focus is directed to badminton which on paper should win us a medal
3787379 but the other athletes are more than capable of proving their worth and springing a surprise
3787380 we have set a target of a medal irrespective of colour chong wei remains our best bet but he has a difficult path to the final we have a well prepared contingent and we must not underestimate their capabilities
3787381 the players were fine with the lighting and were only a little concerned with the wind but all players will face similar conditions so we just have to accept these things
3787382 pei tty eei hui have a tough first round but i have seen no signs of them feeling sorry for themselves since the draw was made they know they cant expect the olympics to be easy and they have been working very hard in training
3787383 this is the olympics and we must dream big i want pei tty eei hui to believe in themselves and take to the court with a positive mind
3787384 i have no complaints about both pairs and their seriousness in training means they are determined to do well they must keep their focus and the rest will come easily
3787385 are making major life decisions on the basis of health care concerns
3787386 i dont think anyone can stop me im bullet proof
3787387 in olympic year people come out of the woodwork but im not expecting someone to come out im doing all i can to end the year as olympic champion
3787388 i do not keep telling myself that i am 67 when i am riding
3787389 i used to be not very happy that every time people would remind me of my age as if telling me i was old
3787390 but i gradually accepted the fact that had it not been my age i would not have got so much attention worldwide
3787391 in our sport the spiritual aspect is as important as the physical side
3787392 i actually think that women tend to communicate better with their horses than men
3787393 but he has been told that the torn cartilage he suffered at wimbledon could now keep him out of tennis for six months
3787394 yes the people around me have said that whatever happens here the really important result was at athens
3787395 anything i achieve here is a bonus if it goes well great if it doesnt go well its not the end of the world im not going to die as a result
3787396 in sport you cant always be the best i just hope to do my best and see what happens
3787397 the depth is amazing so who knows what can happen when all those people come together and have a one off race
3787398 the world record is phenomenal australian kieren perkins swimming 14 41 previous record was something special and for grant to beat that by seven seconds is still unbelievable now
3787399 its probably one of the best records on the books and it can stand for a long long time but who knows
3787400 sent to developing countries like china by unscrupulous recyclers where they are literally bashed open and melted down with few if any safeguards against toxic releases
3787401 this was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort this is our worst performance
3787402 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been
3787403 i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
3787404 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
3787405 i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
3787406 thousands of other republicans are going to be picking country over party in this election
3787407 by prioritizing matters according to the factors above we help ensure that the finite resources of our advisory committee program are devoted to consideration of the most important matters
3787408 we had made a very broad brush cap but as the public comments pointed out its a very different situation when a university receives a grant that is not directly tied to that advisory committee member
3787409 well grant a waiver provided we determine the waiver is necessary to afford the advisory committee essential expertise
3787410 these policies go well beyond the legal requirements enacted recently by congress
3787411 these improvements will help ensure that fda is getting the highest quality scientific advice while at the same time preserving public confidence and trust in our regulatory decisions
3787412 requires more than a showing of inconvenience to the committee or fda
3787413 we do feel that this balance test will give us the expertise that we need
3787414 i doubt if well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
3787415 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
3787416 the players had malaria tablets and injections before we went to africa but wayne has come back and it has knocked him sideways
3787417 michael carrick has also had the virus but maybe he will get part of the game against portsmouth on sunday
3787418 its all been about injuries and viruses at the moment and im wondering if i am going to have a team to start the season
3787419 apart from wayne nani is suspended and anderson is off to the olympics
3787420 im not getting into that because its finished hes staying here hes a manchester united player believe me
3787421 we will take our time as we always do but maybe in this situation we will be a bit quicker this time around
3787422 we will hopefully have somebody in place by the end of september
3787423 it takes times when trying to replace good men but we are fortunate in that we already have a lot of good coaches here anyway
3787424 its been all systems go from the day i set foot in kuala lumpur first i had to see to my latest fall and resort 2008 charity show at hotel istana and the next day i had to fly to kelantan to meet the raja perempuan this is what keeps me going i find the rush and the buzz thrilling
3787425 i went to the famous white house eatery in kb and gorged on typical local fare like nasi tumpang nasi lemak laksam roti bakar akok and of course thick black kopi all in one sitting a few hours later we went to eat more kelantan dishes in kuala krai my hometown
3787426 these are my signature looks i update them in terms of detail colour and cut to give them a new lease of life
3787427 i was inspired by the american indians this time i find the ethnic and exotic motifs of the american indians simple yet striking a few years ago i did a similar range inspired by the western navajo indians but that was more flamboyant with tassels and all
3787428 i took a rest at a resort in adirondack i stayed in a log cabin it was such a good and relaxing holiday this was where i was exposed to the unique beauty and culture of the american indians
3787429 there will be lots of black grey white and silver and not forgetting towering heels to remind one of the stunning skyscrapers in the big apple
3787430 i think the luxury market is strong and sturdy because high end brands have their regulars who have the cash to spend its probably the high street labels that are feeling the pinch because their regular customers mostly in the middle income group would be the ones who are saving and cutting down on spending
3787431 fashion is very global now that no one person not even anna wintour chief editor of us vogue can dictate a fashion fad anymore
3787432 theyre sure of themselves and know what they want they dont get impressed easily this creates a greater challenge for us designers
3787433 i dont watch tv well only cnn for news and thats it my downtime is only at the gym where i do my exercise its hard for me to chill and sit in front of the tv i often travel so im rarely at home
3787434 today is my special day i have someone to celebrate my birthday tomorrow he is very nice and good he treats me and loves me very well he is a very good man not like my ex he is very special this is the most happy thing trach lon gian my dear husband i give all the space in my heart for you
3787435 i dont know what it is that you guys have but it sure sounds beautiful
3787436 im going to go with four fast bowlers and monty panesar
3787437 i think it is an aggressive move a positive move we need to take 20 wickets in this test you need to take 20 in any test and i feel a lot more comfortable with four fast bowlers
3787438 weve given responsibility to the batters to score runs with colly paul collingwood at five freddie andrew flintoff at six timmy ambrose seven and broad eight im looking forward to getting started
3787439 i like steve and what he brings to the team hes had his ups and downs but i have a really good relationship with steve
3787440 he seems as excited as anything and he had a bit of a bounce in his step
3787441 i have complete faith in what captain anil kumble can do
3787442 there is a calm focus about the team and there is a humility about how we are going to go about our business there is no arrogance in the environment
3787443 these players are aware what they need to do and they are right on track in terms of preparations the important thing is the awareness of the situation they know they have an opportunity to win the series
3787444 every guy is aware if he is not fully focused for the next test it could affect the teams performance
3787445 we were happy with the teams response as they lifted their performance by at least 20 per cent in galle
3787446 but the important thing is there is a real awareness about things to achieve in the next test and we have always believed that when this team are firing on all cylinders they can match the best in the world
3787447 there was a tremendous hurt in the team after the loss i think it all started with kumble and from there it filtered down to the rest of the team he is a fantastic leader and fighter
3787448 so to motivate the team to improve their performance by 20 per cent was not really difficult the big challenge now is to see that they maintain it in the third test since they have pulled one back
3787449 he is quality seamer and at the moment he stands out in the indian line up i am very impressed by what he has to offer
3787450 we always have to counter the wrong perception of the public they question how we are going to come to work whether we could type and things like that
3787451 the fact is many blind people i know arrive early at work and as all good typists they dont look at the keyboard
3787452 if parents give children the information theyre curious about and ensure that they understand that sex is an intimacy shared by husband and wife because they love each other that is what will stay in their minds and they will know better when friends try to tell them otherwise
3787453 having teaching aids helps it may be difficult to explain certain aspects and you can let the pictures do the talking
3787454 they need to sense that you are doing this out of concern with a view of helping them have more control over their lives only then will they open up to you
3787455 tell her you will check and get back to her make sure you do because that reflects your commitment in wanting to help her
3787456 all my daughters love movies and music its something we all enjoy and it has been the starting point of many discussions
3787457 they need to be able to come to you with anything and i have always wanted to hear them talking to me rather than just me talking to them
3787458 abortions have become the most common gynaecological procedure performed around the world due to women having unplanned pregnancies
3787459 they have already asked questions but i managed to fend them off with general answers although i do realise how important it is to tell them the truth
3787460 my mother never had any such discussions with me but today such information can make a difference to their personal safety
3787461 the last thing i want is for them to get the wrong information from the wrong source but it does help that we live in an extended family and my children have aunts and uncles they can turn to if they are too embarrassed to ask me something
3787462 we have to be concerned about friends we dont know about and may never see and how they may also influence our childrens behaviour
3787463 its the dumbest idea to come down the pike since jimmy carter called the late syrian president hafez assad his best friend in the middle east

3787470 congress has been toying with slashing that but now isnt the moment
3787471 pakistanis delightfully defied expectations monday by staging a seemingly free election with a minimum of violence voters ousted incumbents by the score and the ruling party quickly accepted defeat
3787472 violence during the elections was relatively low though so was turnout the results were an affirmation that a mostly secular pro democracy center is the strongest force in pakistani politics despite the mounting aggressiveness of islamic extremist groups islamic parties fared poorly in the voting even in the western provinces bordering afghanistan where al qaeda and the taliban are based
3787473 these extremists are also a direct threat to pakistan and its hopes for democracy
3787474 the lesson of the last six years is undeniable without popular support there will be no stability in pakistan and no hope of defeating al qaeda and the taliban
3787475 that is good news given predictions that mr musharraf intended to rig the results not to mention what might have been a bloody fallout if he had
3787476 its also good news that mr musharraf has accepted the result and promised to work with parliamentary leaders
3787477 exactly who those leaders will be is not clear as of this writing and divisions may yet emerge within the major parties particularly the ppp but divided government is a hallmark of a normal democracy and to the extent this election restores popular legitimacy to the government it will help in pakistan s efforts to combat islamist militancy and terrorism both in remote provinces and such urban centers as karachi
3787478 for the bush administration mondays election means that it can continue to transition from what is often described as a musharraf policy to a broader pakistani one
3787479 but u s interests in pakistan are best served by cultivating democratic institutions and a vibrant civil society with its own interests in fighting islamic extremism thats precisely the goal that seems to have been at least modestly advanced in mondays election

3787483 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3787484 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3787485 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3787486 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3787487 these contributed to a heightened sense of risk and strengthened the genuine suspicion that the persons identified were in fact a threat to the tank and its crew
3787488 the tank crews superiors asked to authorize firing by the tank reasonably concluded that the characters identified by the tank were hostile and posed a threat to the tank and its crew

3787512 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning

3787522 they can learn information on their own versus asking questions to maybe some of the guys that they hang out with and play with
3787523 if you look at the wii all play version it is a lot less intimidating for females because of the controller
3787524 if women are just starting out playing the game this will help them because if youre not a huge core gamer the xbox 360 and the ps3 controllers can be pretty intimidating
3787525 you have to learn which buttons to push at which times and for the wii you dont really have to do that

3787584 liam dawson bowled brilliantly to pick up five wickets and hamza riazuddin took a fantastic swirling catch at third man after greg morgan got a thick outside edge to put them nine down even though they only needed one to win
3787585 the two batsman crossed whilst the ball was in the air so the new batter was not on strike but nick beard moved across his stumps to try and flick it behind square only to have his middle stump knocked back
3787586 weve had some tight finishes and from a pleasing point of view this comes second only to the win we had against bangladesh in the quarter finals of the 2006 world cup
3787587 the game at loughborough was decimated by the weather to a certain degree but from our point of view it was a privilege to be given a game of that standing
3787588 that the u19 team are deemed good enough to be given a game against an incoming a team is very exciting for us as a department and to have the chance to hopefully provide worthy opposition to incoming a sides in the future is certainly a bonus
3787589 it was great preparation for us to take into the new zealand test matches
3787590 we are always looking for them to step up and to see how they handle certain pressures
3787591 we dont generally get our players together before the incoming tour because of county commitments and the like so to get the players in and focused together was a great bonus
3787592 the weather was again disappointing and we managed to get the game finished probably 15 minutes before a game ending deluge came and flooded taunton
3787593 it was great to win and we dominated the test match so we deserved it we needed to bowl them out and the wicket was slow but will beer got us off to a great start with a wicket from the first ball of the fourth morning and we carried on from there to turn the screw
3787594 the other test match was drawn on a fairly flat wicket at worcester so it proved crucial for us to win that game
3787595 if im honest from a coaching and development point of view we probably deserved to lose on monday but you dont see many teams hold their nerve and get anything from a game in that situation so it was good to see
3787596 we did a really good fielding session the night before
3787597 richard came down and we had a great session under the lights and that showed when we fielded in the actual game no more so when hamza took that catch at the end
3787598 its brilliant when you can say to the team that there is a direct relation to him taking a brilliant catch and saving the game and from an education and learning point of view that was a great thing to see
3787599 both games we have left are live on tv which gives another interesting twist to see how it affects the players

3787674 she appeared to be contorting her all but invisible face and writhing her smokelike body in a quite meaningless fashion at last i came to the conclusion incredible as it seemed that she supposed herself still capable of attracting them and was trying to do so she was a thing that had become incapable of conceiving conversation save as a means to that end if a corpse already liquid with decay had arisen from the coffin smeared its gums with lipstick and attempted a flirtation the result could not have been more appalling in the end she muttered stupid creatures and turned back to the bus
3787675 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3787676 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3787677 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3787678 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3787679 under this strategy the time horizon for redeployment would be negotiated with the iraqi government and nested within a more assertive approach to regional diplomacy the united states would make clear that iraq and america share a common interest in achieving sustainable stability in iraq and that the united states is willing to help support the iraqi government and build its security and governance capacity over the long term but only so long as iraqis continue to make meaningful political progress
3787680 preventing them from acquiring heavy weapons tightly restricting their jurisdictions and movement and closely monitoring them for compliance so that they do not rub up against rival militias
3787681 iraqis of all sectarian and ethnic groups believe that the u s military invasion is the primary root of the violent differences among them and see the departure of occupying forces as the key to national reconciliation
3787682 i dont even feel like i should be out here practicing or going into the preseason but its something nobody else feels like is affecting anything so im out there practicing and playing games

3787700 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3787701 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3787702 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3787703 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3787704 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3787705 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

3787710 i dont even like to stereotype and say gang members i say theyre disenfranchised youth
3787711 they dont really have all the tools to make the right decisions thats necessary in todays society and they dont fully understand the system
3787712 bo would tell his personal story of being a former gang member who would not let gang life trap him into a sense of hopelessness and despair
3787713 and he talked about working hard and not making excuses
3787714 you dont find many in the gang intervention world who can be effective in the street effective in the courtroom effective at city hall and effective in the prisons he could calm everyone down and make us work together
3787715 he helped bridge that divide by setting the example of partnership

3787779 when the napalm hit our village many people were still sleeping in their homes
3787780 those who survived the flames ran to the tidal flats we were trying to show the american pilots that we were civilians but they strafed us women and children
3787781 we should not ignore or conceal the deaths of unarmed civilians that resulted not from the mistakes of a few soldiers but from systematic aerial bombing and strafing
3787782 history teaches us that we need an alliance but that alliance should be based on humanitarian principles
3787783 we thank the american troops for saving our country from communism for the peace and prosperity we have today
3787784 does that mean we have to shut up about what happened to our families
3787785 the mission was to saturate the area so thoroughly with napalm that all installations on that area would be burned
3787786 but the flashes observed on the ground indicated the intensity of the fire to be accurate enough to destroy any about
3787787 methodical destruction of dwellings and other buildings forward of front lines which are or susceptible of being utilized by the enemy for shelter
3787788 methodical burning out poor farmers when no enemy is present is against the grain of u s soldiers
3787789 when the napalm hit the entrance the blast and smoke knocked out kerosene and castor oil lamps we had in the cave
3787790 it was a pitch black chaos people shouting for each other stampeding choking some said we should crawl in deeper covering our faces with wet cloth some said we should rush out through the blaze those who were not burned to death suffocated
3787791 the americans pushed us back toward the enemy area and then bombed us
3787792 if you say these killings were not deliberate and were mistakes how can you explain the fact that there were so many of these incidents
3787793 we consider macarthur a hero to our country but no one can know the suffering our family endured

3787842 striking a child at school or at home is wrong caning in any form is unacceptable to me how do we measure moderation in assaulting someone physically the educator to me has no right to touch a child if society wants to do that then it must have parliamentary approval as an educational policy do we have a national policy on that
3787843 caning has negative developmental effects on children it is an extension of the wrongful behaviour of the past patriarchal system of dominance which thought and believed that children and women have to be physically punished for their misdemeanors
3787844 brings increased aggression in children it creates in them anti social behavours which in turn creates greater tolerance for violence because they have been subjected to that sort of violent treatment as they grow anytime they see violence they can tolerate it it becomes a sport to them
3787845 the united nations study on violence against children has targeted the year 2009 as the year for the universal prohibition of corporal punishment and all forms of abuses against children not only at school but at home
3787846 if we are to raise academic standards in our schools we need alternatives to physical punishment so i suggest the training of teachers and educators in alternative discipline strategies
3787847 to replace physical punishment there should be the need for behaviour modification and positive reinforcement that is rewarding the child for good behaviour or probing the reasons behind the childs actions
3787848 when a child comes to school late do you beat the child
3787849 for example the childs home circumstances the child might be living with people who are not the parents or even an orphan this child may be the same person who sells in the morning before he or she goes to school the teacher must know all theses by beating the child he misses the mark
