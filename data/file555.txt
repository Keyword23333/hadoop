5550010 if that were like an olympic sport i would really really like to try out for it
5550011 i got used to signing my name really really fast cause i sign cds and stuff and sign pictures for people and sell em at the merch stand a lot of times so ill be signing thousands and thousands of cd covers and pictures a day so i want there to be like an artist olympics like at the cmas or something or during cma music festival like all the artists get together and have autograph signing competitions and meet and greet line competitions i think itd be funny
5550012 every american anthem deserves a rockin music video and thats exactly what we made
5550013 the raisin mccain video is another way for me to celebrate and support senator mccain and ultimately inspire people to vote
5550014 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5550015 i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
5550016 so what youre hearing are the vocal takes while we are playing the music at the same time
5550017 people dont do that any more especially people who arent singer songwriters
5550018 sometimes artists they go in and they havent even seen the band
5550019 theres stuff that made this record that might not have if jeffrey hadnt gone through losing his son and mom hadnt got diagnosed toward the end of making the record
5550020 so there are things on there that got a little darker and deeper
5550021 my mom my hero and my guardian angel and to alex levasseur and the whole levasseur family
5550022 i am truly humbled by this once in a lifetime honor
5550023 the vision and commitment of the swedish government the university of stockholm and the entire criminology community in establishing the stockholm prize was unbelievable i share this distinction with all of them and pledge to honor the title by continuing to work tirelessly to advance the field of criminology
5550024 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5550025 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5550026 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5550027 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5550028 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5550029 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5550030 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5550031 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5550032 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5550033 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5550034 the employer might not explain the reason for the firing so its difficult to get accurate statistics on how often it happens

5550040 sometimes computers lose their mind dont ask me why or how it happens but it does sometimes you simply have to totally discharge the computer one thing i have learned about the blue and white g3 and the gray g4 computers is that sometimes pushing the cuda pmu is not enough if your machine still is dead then try the following unplug the unit remove the battery push the cuda pmu switch count to 5 slow push the start button on the front of the computer count to 5 slow let the unit sit for 15 30 minutes replace the battery plug it back in and push the start button if it doesnt work i usually repeat the steps above pull the ram and let it sit longer if it doesnt work after this it is take it to the shop time

5550052 we can see little flash points in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later

5550054 the disease can be eliminated in the country if the people adhere to a simple formula by keeping their houses and compounds clean
5550055 unless the chinese physicians can substantiate the claim with scientific proof that coconut water can cure chikungunya the health ministry will not endorse the claim
5550056 we cannot wait until the problem is rampant we must take the bull by its horns
5550057 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5550058 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5550059 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5550060 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5550061 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5550062 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5550063 uh well lets see ill see what we can do

5550067 according to businessweek the solution to the iphone 3gs chipset issues could be easier than most of us probably expected apparently apple set up the infineon chip to demand more of a 3g signal than was necessary which resulted in a switch back to the slower network if there are too many people in the area using an iphone at the same time this involves an issue with software on the chip which can probably be remedied through an upgrade instead of a costly and annoying recall businessweek claims that apple and chip maker infineon are hard at work on the fix and it could be released as early as the end of this month businessweek via cnet
5550068 hey mom somethings come up hubbys out and i need to run a quick child free errand can m come over for a bit

5550080 the one to the leg has been an accumulative injury for years but it was cured the major problem for this withdrawal is his heel i dont know when it was hurt probably six or seven years ago before athens the injury has been back and forth between intensive training and rest
5550081 four years after athens his main goal was beijing gold and he has done great work for it
5550082 todays result is not perfect especially for liu xiang there is a great expectation and a great pressure from all for the past four years liu xiang has been an athlete with great stability who never drops out of competition easily

5550097 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5550098 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5550099 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out

5550117 there were nearly 30 000 naturalization cases submitted to the fbi before may of 2006 that were most likely recently resolved
5550118 this is one of the reasons we see a similar name to someone on a terrorist watch list
5550119 i think what happened to ahmed is simply that he applied for citizenship at a time when there were a lot of security concerns
5550120 i thought oh my god i bet they think my client is this guy
5550121 it means good news like if your wife is pregnant and has a baby you say warsame good news
5550122 this has really created a hardship for me and my family
5550123 me and my family feel mr oliver should not get any good time in this matter
5550124 but i am required to follow the law and the law calls for a stayed sentence

5550135 you murdered my mother and tried to murder my niece you caused this family nothing but pain and devastation
5550136 certainly we all feel horrible that the wrong person was initially found guilty by a jury for this crime
5550137 were thankful that justice was finally served and the real killer will spend the rest oh his life in prison
5550138 failing to bargain realistically and remove unattainable items from the table
5550139 you cant have a plan that just says were holding secret meetings and our question is just what the hell does that mean
5550140 me me me me me me and oh yeah me
5550141 i need him to do xyz because then if he does ill feel loved and appreciated
5550142 i view this with great concern and ive sent my boys to the ground to see how these people do it
5550143 yes it is corruption when i talked to the transport operators they said they dont want to be the target of a witch hunt
5550144 there are several formats for the test do they serve the purpose or not
5550145 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile
5550146 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge
5550147 the operating environment during the next 12 months is expected to be the most challenging the virgin blue group which now comprises virgin blue pacific blue polynesian blueand vaustralia has experienced to date
5550148 from a marketers point of view you want to have the athletes in the news pages as well as the sports pages so if that can happen for the good reasons the right reasons
5550149 stephanies got a sensational body all those swimmers have got bodies because they train so hard
5550150 shes on the front cover of new idea and womens day this week so shes hot

5550152 not winning a gold medal has probably cost him millions of dollars
5550153 i cant stay angry it takes to much out of me
5550154 so what the fuck does watson have to do with it he doesnt ride a motorbike
5550155 prweb has untreacherous against go on a serious demeanor up to facilitate my fill out and florists courses response
5550156 we believe the general election must be held as soon as practicably possible but only after we have achieved broad consensus in fiji for a non racial and truly democratic electoral system and agreed on a constitutional and legal way to introduce it
5550157 we have proposed the presidents dialogue forum and invited the commonwealth and united nations joint assistance to independently facilitate this dialogue
5550158 those who are behind the hard line stance taken against fiji who insist that an election be held in march 09 are not really interested in helping the people of fiji to deal with the problems that were exacerbated by the very politicians that the metropolitan countries in our forum hope will regain power in fiji should an election be held in march 09
5550159 outsiders cannot decide this for us what we need from the forum and our other international development partners is understanding and support

5550161 i didnt expect 30 home runs during the first week of august but i thought he could be a 30 homer guy and more important a good on base percentage guy we needed to fix some things from last year
5550162 im a pretty bright guy i can look at things and say this might not work out for me but theres some value there i was hurt but if i have some value maybe they can trade me i wasnt sure i knew that they had an idea in their head i felt i knew what the idea was the trade happened quick for my betterment it gave me a chance to play and it gave them a chance to take that young talented group and bring them together even more
5550163 once i got confirmation from our doctors that he was going to be okay healthwise i was confident he would return to being the player we have seen in the past
5550164 weve been asking for him for a number of years
5550165 we share a spring training complex so weve seen a lot of carlos quentin we shouldnt get any brownie points for scouting when the guy was right in front of us for a number of years
5550166 but i wouldnt say that when i first came over to cleveland
5550167 before i hurt my knee i was hitting cleanup between victor martinez and travis hafner i had a pretty good august

5550169 i missed almost the whole next year missed the first half of the season
5550170 i was a prospect an all star at every level and i played in the futures game from the media standpoint i had never had success at this level except for the last year
5550171 at every level i feel theres a learning curve last year i got my confidence and went into the off season knowing i could improve on that there were areas i felt i needed to improve i shortened my swing and i hit the weight room hard
5550172 what consumers want is to be able to find information faster and they want clues to help them find their way to that information faster
5550173 what were doing is quite unique and nobody can do what were doing
5550174 we believe were one of the top three or four alternative search engines in the marketplace
5550175 youre going to see more and more search engines become part of other applications so we think that this application will be particularly well suited for when youre looking for people or companies or entities of any nature
5550176 the reason why people wanted to develop semantic web search engines is because its a more real way of finding stuff
5550177 keeping in mind that the content is growing faster search engines need to be more effective at reflecting the thinking of real people
5550178 some people think that the behaviour of how people express their information needs has been established by google so even though they dont express it in natural language they do use just a couple of words
5550179 can that behaviour be untrained if they could express things more completely in a full sentence or in a question thats to be determined google just has so much market share right now
5550180 my son loved the original star wars and is still

5550198 these guys arent one dimensional its not just the speed these guys have the ability to change a game thats going to help us win
5550199 clearly quite tight and are getting tighter as commercial banks pass on their increased borrowing costs to customers
5550200 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted the minutes said
5550201 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5550202 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5550203 scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5550204 given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing the minutes said
5550205 firstly a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date the minutes said
5550206 if that occurred the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater
5550207 policy had to take account of this risk particularly given both the recent high cpi reading and those in prospect in the near term
5550208 the staff forecast for growth had been revised down slightly while that for inflation was slightly higher in the near term but still saw inflation starting to fall back towards the target during 2009 and 2010 the minutes said
5550209 the staff forecast for growth of the australian economy over the year ahead had been lowered slightly and remained below consensus the minutes said
5550210 it was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010
5550211 clear evidence of that decline beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5550212 the national accounts for the june quarter to be published in early september were likely to show that growth of gdp had been low and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the september quarter was also possible the minutes said
5550213 members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions the minutes said
5550214 tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but on the other hand the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially to national income and capacity to spend
5550215 nansulate has been specified into the main cooling and heating system for this design nansulate added to the mattress cover system was found to reduce cooling temperature at a rate of 1 8 degrees per minute as compared to the foam insulation alone which reduced temperature at a rate of 1 1 degrees per minute all tests were performed under identical conditions cooling one gallon of fluid by speeding up the cooling process substantial energy savings were achieved in addition nansulate prevented sweating during the cooling process and also prevents growth of unwanted substances on the surface of the system
5550216 the same carefully researched cooling and heating system specifying nansulate will be incorporated into a new machine to form x ray invisible casts with perfectly even pressure over the entire area of a broken limb the casts can be worn while swimming or bathing and re formed again with perfectly even pressure when swelling reduces due to nansulate the time to form a perfectly even pressure cast will be approximately three minutes additionally nansulate is being specified in the heating and cooling system for a unique portable machine to heat and or cool with adjustable massage any area of the body for sports medicine and general physiotherapy needs this machine will free up the doctor or technician to perform other tasks the portability of the battery operated machine is due in large part to the energy savings realized with nansulate insulating coatings
5550217 the incorporation of our nansulate coating into these medical devices represents a brand new market segment opportunity edward moore design is an expert in their field and we look forward to our technology offering unique benefits to their company for this medical equipment and other designs energy savings is something that is important to every industry and we are pleased to offer a solution that can be used in a variety of diverse applications

5550221 this imaging modality allows us to see things weve never been able to see before
5550222 we shine light on a nanotube and listen to the ultrasound waves coming out of it
5550223 we will be able to ask a tumor are you responding to chemotherapy or not

5550230 domestic policy can only defeat us foreign policy can kill us
5550231 the anti terrorist squad of uttar pradesh has arrested one isi agent of pakistan from rupaideeha in bahraich district
5550232 a city that hands its police force a license to trash the constitutional rights of its citizens is not a city that is upholding law and order and protecting its citizens on the contrary unlimited police power is a complete breakdown of the law
5550233 these interrogations and checkpoints are comparable to police practices in authoritarian regimes and especially apartheid era south africa which is even more ominous given the fact the residents of these new red zones are mostly african american and poor
5550234 such measures also recall the repression by police and private security firms in post katrina new orleans which accompanied the obstruction and expulsion of mostly poor and black residents from their homes
5550235 these policies have only empowered criminal gangs involved in the drug trade just as prohibition fed the growth of organized crime the aclu is right two of our most important freedoms the right of mobility and protection against warrantless search and seizure are being nullified for the sake of the disastrous war on drugs in violation of local law and the us constitution
5550236 democratic and republican politicians are equally responsible for the transformation of civilian police into militias
5550237 the drug war has very little to do with drugs its about control coercion and power its about money america wont get sane drug laws and law enforcement until enough greens get elected to public office to overturn these self defeating unconstitutional policies
5550238 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it

5550243 local historians were assiduously applied to the task of inventing history sometime since the first european historian did his research in the area and the present jhelum had become the name of alexanders horse i was surprised to discover locally printed histories carrying on and on about famous horse that dies at jhelum and gave the town its name all of these so called histories have been printed in the last thirty or so years which implies that this industry of pseudo history became fashionable in the recent past
5550244 two things are evident one that jhelum never matured as a trading town that whatever scant marchandize could be seen in its bazaars was the leavings of the limited trade transiting through here secondly in the presence of the busier ferries of jalalpur haranpur and even despite its bitter ground water pind dadan khan jhelum was the less preferred crossing point indeed at the point of annexation in 1849 by the british the town contained only five hundred houses that is its population was not much above three thousand souls a far cry from a rich and prosperous town
5550245 he draws his inspiration from the writers of history who treated their subject as a grand denouement of a dramatic plot with historical personages as characters he is thus far away from those academic historians who establish a thesis and then laboriously fill in data to prove their assumptions
5550246 salman rashid is not a historian neither is he a social scientist he basically loves to write about places and people with the zest and passion that is more the forte of creative writing this strength can easily turn into a flaw but he knows when to stop and puts an end to the surge of passion before it freewheels from the umbilical cord of history into fantasy

5550258 lor al would like to express its utmost surprise at the result of this decision which dismissed the action from lanc me a subsidiary of the group against ebay for the sale of counterfeits on ebay platform
5550259 lor al believes the court to be mistaken in its decision to minimise the role of ebay in the sale of products on its platform
5550260 this is the second successful court ruling in a row for ebay both supporting our view that controlling prices and distribution reduces consumer choice
5550261 the litigation of counterfeits against ebay has been exposed as merely a stalking horse ebay provides a vibrant and trusted marketplace that gives european consumers a good deal we work to tackle the menace of counterfeit through action and co operation with rights owners
5550262 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
5550263 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise

5550272 we all know that criminal behavior doesnt stop at the town or cityline
5550273 if someoneslooking to commit a crime in plainville theres a good chance hes beeninvolved in similar behavior in nearby communities source bio key international inc copyright 2008 pr newswire all rights reserved or he associates withothers from those communities and theres a good chance that theresvaluable information on that individual in the local rms systems in thosecommunities

5550283 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right theres a lot that comes with being an nfl football player
5550284 we all want to win but only one guy can still the thrill of competing of being in the hunt is what were about
5550285 well i am anti genocide but this is something that we need to let individuals choose
5550286 its fantastic my manager and the club have been working pretty hard in the last couple of weeks and they knocked it over pretty quickly so now i can look forward to playing some good footy
5550287 the club has been fantastic for me not only with my footy but off the field as well with some issues they have really helped me out so i want to pay them back

5550294 i was taking care of my mother and she was on an oxygen generator so a generator to keep that piece of equipment going was vital to her life
5550295 keep the generator outside the house outside of the garage outside so it can breathe you dont want carbon monoxide poisoning to happen which unfortunately does tend to happen after widespread outages because people use them in their house

5550298 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5550299 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5550300 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5550301 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5550302 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5550303 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5550304 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5550305 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5550306 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things

5550321 it is very exciting to be part of a growing team that is driving theevolution of true cyber intelligence
5550322 i am proud to joinneuraliq and will focus my experience and leadership commitment onachieving a new level of growth and success in a highly dynamic andexpanding world market events of the past week where russia launched acyber attack on georgia before firing the first shot or dropping the firstbomb are proof positive were in the right business at the right time
5550323 traditional security is no longer able tohold its own against the overwhelming flood of new and highly targetedattacks
5550324 security needs a new ally one that learns fromattackers in real time exposing their tools methods and intentionsbefore critical assets are compromised neuraliqs real time intrusionforensics systems deliver precisely that kind of intelligence and in theprocess make traditional security smarter and more agile
5550325 neuraliq has dedicated itself to delivering aggressive solutions thattip the balance of power away from attackers
5550326 we are now poised to deliver these solutions to ourfederal and corporate clients and we look forward to donnie blanksleadership and expertise to help us get there
5550327 the greens may be disorganized but at least im not held accountable to any corporate party
5550328 theyre not going to be asking me to do something im not interested in doing
5550329 currently our united states government is bombing people who look like me
5550330 i dont want them using my image and then say get out of iraq but continue to fund it
5550331 now there is an increasingly powerful and vocal national movement to stop mountaintop removal
5550332 im saying were going to have it stopped by the end of next year the end of 2009
5550333 if the american people knew what was happening in appalachia i feel certain that they would demand an end to this practice
5550334 i think if we get a new president itll be stopped and i guess were going to get a new president by next year
5550335 i can tell you we havent had any significant permits issued since march 2007 because the court found that the federal government was illegally issuing permits at that time

5550343 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
5550344 so many taxpayers already feel overtaxed what do you think the reaction will be to a property tax increase
5550345 thank you for asking that question one thing i would like to point out is while we are at the board meeting tonight while there are many people speaking in favor of that tax rate increase there is not one person who spoke against it while i am not so na ve as to think there are no people out there who will oppose it the one thing i think people including myself are willing to invest in its their students their children
5550346 if you make it back let me know how it goes
5550347 so this is the route that i think we should take
5550348 wait do these red lines look like a different red color than these red lines
5550349 holy shit these guys are way out here and there is only 90minutes of day light left
5550350 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged
5550351 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5550352 whether or not the us would be able to get the treaty through congress if in every other respect it acts in accordance to achieve those goals through sovereign actions that in itself would be an incredibly good thing
5550353 i think our officials are working very closely on this to make sure there are no barriers towards linking these schemes and based on my advice there are none
5550354 an area of endeavour for us is what we do domestically on the renewable energy front
5550355 its important that we get together now to prepare for what will possibly be our toughest qualifier for the world cup because we go into the unknown against uzbekistan
5550356 were going into an environment that were not used to and they had an extremely good qualifying round previously so its going to be tough
5550357 ever since guus hiddink came in and completely changed our formations and got us thinking about different styles weve learned to adapt to anything
5550358 and the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us
5550359 the next few games arent about winning necessarily its about a good performance and preparing for uzbekistan which inevitably is the most important game
5550360 we saw a little bit of them at the asian cup last year they looked a pretty good side
5550361 theyre going to be a very very difficult game for us away thats why these two friendly games are important because we can get together as a squad and get some game time under our belts
5550362 were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
5550363 so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort
5550364 while this political process is underway we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists and because of what i just said this is a fight that they are in as well
5550365 thats what the prime minister said when he was in washington
5550366 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5550367 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5550368 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5550369 the extremist ideology is one that has been out there and among these groups for many years
5550370 lets be very clear about where this started and thats with the extremists
5550371 a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5550372 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism
5550373 they both came up really well its a positive outlook for both people
5550374 archie was a bit down when he got back but hes progressing well he progressed in the last 24 hours so he looks like hes really a good chance to play against newcastle and nick ward is the same
5550375 as i have done nothing wrong in connection with any of the matters that are the subject of the inquiry i expect to be exonerated
5550376 in the near future i would love to have a talk about new challenges and opportunities in education and training and the provision of safe and fair workplaces in nsw
5550377 he has on many occasions stated his innocence hes just repeating that
5550378 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5550379 i will be supporting the removal of abortion from the crimes act i think thats the right thing its the right thing in terms of public policy
5550380 but i would stress that the proposal we are putting to the parliament is one that would be consistent and fully consistent with current clinical practice
5550381 for women i think its a crucial matter for them that a personal decision theyve made about themselves and their body is subject to action under the criminal code
5550382 removing this from the criminal code is important for women it is something that many women and many womens organisations have fought long and hard for so i think its important
5550383 today the rights of the unborn children have been forsaken by the victorian government this is a very very sad event
5550384 i dont want women any more to feel that this is some kind of terrible shame
5550385 interestingly this morning all the emails that i have been getting are from women in my age group who underwent similar sort of circumstances themselves and i think its really important to bring down that taboo
5550386 if it is that the bill reflects the second of the third options as reflected in the paper then i will oppose it
5550387 i dont think he warnock has been affected by what appears to be an ambush
5550388 robbies a required player and in the end that will be his decision about what he wants to do
5550389 id love him to stay i think hes got some good scope and id love to work with him over the next couple of years
5550390 he probably understands hes still evolving as a player and hes probably going to play with a guy sandilands that hopefully asserts himself into a dominant ruckman for a period of time
5550391 and robbie can play along with that for many years to come and thats the striking thing that he should be looking forward to at this stage
5550392 it will be great if he does but at the end of the day its up to him and well just see what happens
5550393 hes very important hes a great player to have around the club a great person and a great football player
5550394 in view of certain developments a decision has been taken that fiji will not attend the forum meeting in niue
5550395 this regrettable and unfortunate situation of fiji not participating in the forum meeting in niue arises because of the decision taken by the government of new zealand
5550396 his attendance was expected and there is no reason he should not do so
5550397 commodore bainimarama had the opportunity through his attendance at the forum to explain this decision in person to pacific leaders
5550398 fiji will still be despite his absence a major feature of leaders discussions in niue
5550399 that commodore bainimarama should meet his solemn commitment to hold elections by march next year
5550400 he is trying it on here the bottom line is that there is no forum event in new zealand
5550401 trying to blame new zealand for something that doesnt exist is nonsense
5550402 some pacific countries have arranged to have bilateral meetings here that is entirely their business
5550403 the pacific forum needs to understand that we in fiji will decide what is in our national interest in the short and the long term
5550404 it is very well for the new zealand prime minister to call for unity of the pacific forum on the issue of elections in fiji
5550405 this so called unity cannot be against fiji as that is neither achievable nor acceptable
5550406 most if not all pacific island leaders are against fiji being further victimised by australia and new zealand even if they may not say so openly in niue
5550407 according to the independent electoral commission it will take at least another 12 to 15 months to prepare for election
5550408 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119 kilometers or 74 miles per hour as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5550409 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5550410 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a tropical storm or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people
5550411 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5550412 from very early on dr nelson has sided with the spirits industry in opposing this measure
5550413 but from the early evidence that we have from the tax office this measure is being successful
5550414 dr nelson needs to explain what impact his opposition to this measure will have on the health of young people and on the sorts of outcomes that we are trying to achieve for the community in making sure that young people have a healthier approach in the way they consume alcohol
5550415 i immediately called the store and spoke with lexi who told me that she did indeed have the backpack she said that the managers lock up lost amp found items so not to worry i went in today to pick up my item and lexi reluctantly informed me that it was gone as i type my sweet generous daughter is softly crying on the sofa she feels bad for me because she knows that it was hard for us to afford the lunch outing and we cant replace the gameboy she is more crushed however that someone stole from her what a terrific lesson for a child who bought that gameboy with her own money
5550416 edit a member of our us army just emailed me he shipped virginia a nintendo ds i am constantly humbled by the generosity and kindness of you all several of you offered to paypal funds or buy one and send it to her and i cant thank you enough for the gift youve given me
5550417 and i want you all to know that when i explained to her how many of you were wishing her well and offering to help she burst into tears
5550418 if i hadnt lost my stuff they wouldnt feel bad and feel like they have to do something for me
5550419 so after talking with paul the incredibly sweet man who sent virginia a nintendo ds he only wanted v to do what she wanted with the game he sent and does not want it back virginia wants very much to give it to someone who might otherwise never have one so heres what we came up with
5550420 looking at the comments on that page makes me wonder when he became the new chuck norris
5550421 just a normal person from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
5550422 and if he looks indefatigable at times its because of the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder which he was diagnosed with at the tender age of nine
5550423 you just cant invade a sovereign country in the 21st century
5550424 the republican party is a dead rotting carcass with a few decrepit old leaders stumbling around like zombies in a horror version of weekend with bernie handcuffed to a corpse
5550425 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch
5550426 the main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value
5550427 at midnight we are going to take operational control of cemexs installations and from that moment the expropriation decree takes effect
5550428 the disease can be eliminated in the country if the people adhere to a simple formula by keeping their houses and compounds clean
5550429 unless the chinese physicians can substantiate the claim with scientific proof that coconut water can cure chikungunya the health ministry will not endorse the claim
5550430 we will also resolve the shortage by asking the public services department to take in more doctors immediately and we will also engage foreign doctors
5550431 i have directed the ministrys director general to expedite the plan and also to recall local doctors now serving abroad
5550432 i view this with great concern and ive sent my boys to the ground to see how these people do it
5550433 yes it is corruption when i talked to the transport operators they said they dont want to be the target of a witch hunt
5550434 there are several formats for the test do they serve the purpose or not

5550615 who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor
5550616 who has ever given to god that god should repay him
5550617 and who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this
5550618 now there are different kinds of spiritual gifts but it is the same holy spirit who is the source of them all there are different kinds of service in the church but it is the same lord we are serving there are different ways god works in our lives but it is the same god who does the work through all of us a spiritual gift is given to each of us as a means of helping the entire church
5550619 if one part suffers all the parts suffer with it and if one part is honored all the parts are glad
5550620 if we are the body why arent his hands healing why is his love not showing them there is a way
5550621 sin whispers to the wicked deep within their hearts they have no fear of god to restrain them
5550622 your unfailing love o lord is as vast as the heavens your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds your righteousness is like the mighty mountains your justice like the ocean depths
5550623 for you are the fountain of life the light by which we see
5550624 whoever pursues godliness and unfailing love will find life godliness and honor
5550625 there are different kinds of gifts but the same spirit there are different kinds of service but the same lord there are different kinds of working but the same god works all of them in all men
5550626 a pointed stake is set upright in the ground and the culprit is taken placed on the sharp point and then pulled down by his legs till the stake that went in at the fundament passes up through the body and comes out through the neck a most dreadful species of punishment in which revenge and cruelty may glut the utmost of their malice the culprit lives a considerable time in excruciating agonies
5550627 since mordecai before whom your downfall has started is of jewish origin you cannot stand against him you will surely come to ruin
5550628 do not think in your heart that you will escape in the kings palace any more than all the other jews 14 for if you remain completely silent at this time relief and deliverance will arise for the jews from another place but you and your fathers house will perish yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this
5550629 go gather all the jews who are present in shushan and fast for me neither eat nor drink for three days night or day my maids and i will fast likewise and so i will go to the king which is against the law and if i perish i perish
5550630 my name is nabid haddad i am a palestinian arab born in haifa in 1938 to christian arab parents
5550631 i remember that from my earliest childhood i would always go to bed depressed i became determined to find a way to be happy i became convinced that if i could become rich and successful then i would be happy that became my goal
5550632 by the age of thirty i was a millionaire however the depression had not left me i started seeking material things to make me happy nothing worked
5550633 finally i began to ask questions who is this man jesus who is the one that people still talk about 2 000 years after his death who is this one that some people even worship
5550634 i opened the bible wanting to see what this jesus had said about himself and a presence filled the room somehow i knew that jesus is the son of god i spent most of the next year reading the bible and talking to my friends about jesus but i was still depressed
5550635 god replied what have you done with the revelation that jesus is my son
5550636 i found someone who could show me how to pray i repented and asked jesus into my heart a few months later i was filled with the holy spirit now i had the answer i no longer went to bed depressed
5550637 but my life was still not right my business continued to go downhill again i confronted the lord
5550638 you tricked me before i knew anything about your son jesus i was doing all right then you showed me that he is your son and things started going wrong then i received him into my life and now im losing everything
5550639 im going to take all these false gods away from you to show you who the true living god is but i will restore you
5550640 one day as i was worshiping i said how great you are
5550641 he said what about the jewish people you still hold resentment in your heart against them
5550642 i remembered how my whole life had always cursed the jews i was trained to hate them from my earliest years now in the presence of the lord i said i renounce my resentment in my heart toward the jewish people i forgive them immediately something changed inside of me
5550643 shortly after this i saw that god in his word had told abraham the father of the jews ill bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you genesis 12 3 then i realized that my finances had not been under a blessing but under a curse a curse of insufficiency i had never been able to make enough money to meet my needs
5550644 since 1982 when i was released from the curse of anti semitism and the curse of insufficiency that went with it my income has always exceeded my expenses and my needs and i am able to give liberally to the work of the kingdom of god
5550645 the lesson of nabils life is clear no one can afford to hate or curse the jewish people
5550646 t he church owes every spiritual blessing she claims to the jewish people without the jews the church would have no apostles no bible and no savior
5550647 what honor or dignity has been bestowed on mordecai for this
5550648 having a truly pure heart in the intimacy of the lord
5550649 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
5550650 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course

5550938 the beauty of whiteknighttwo and spaceshiptwo is that they can help change our relationship with space
5550939 the other thing that i admire about the system is that it has the architecture that would someday be developed into passenger carrying vehicle able to take people from a to b around the planet outside of the atmosphere at near orbital speeds
5550940 if we do i believe well unlock a wall of private sector money into both space launch systems and space technology
5550941 you cant have schedule pressure before you fly because thats not a safe thing to do in terms of what the schedule will be to complete you really dont know anything until you start flying
5550942 you dont know when youre going to be done until you march through the research flight tests

5550952 i really think were on the threshold of a new era of commercial space transportation
5550953 this just makes it real because weve got some hardware coming together and test flying starting its going to be an exciting next couple of years
5550954 thats why people come to mojave the whiteknighttwo spaceshiptwo they are one more example of a result that will yield breakthroughs in aerospace here at the mojave air and space port were all about results

5550992 im a girl who likes to have fun try new things and even show my quirky side
5550993 as soon as the idea of formulating a principled case either in favor of or against social ism is dropped
5550994 how can this be we won a gold and two bronze and they treat us like this while they the footballers didnt win anything but they are in business class
5550995 truly i say to you it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven 24 again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
5550996 with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible

5551003 we will continue to closely monitor russian actions in georgia for confirmation of the withdrawal
5551004 the dream of georgia is to be like the u s
5551005 the relationship is based on more than geopolitical considerations its based on values that we share
5551006 what if the russians come again and come to tbilisi what are we going to do our army is completely destroyed it would be good if the americans sent troops here
5551007 i defend americans they are the best people i have ever known
5551008 the u s has strong and deep ties to georgia
5551009 what they georgians are trying to do is build a democratic nation like the u s
5551010 its something that has been deeply cultivated over the years by washington
5551011 theyve put in about 1 billion in aid since the early 1990s the united states kept the lights on when georgia was bankrupt there is a huge investment here by the state department and usaid u s agency for international development

5551014 while working out ways it can be easier for parents to take leave following the birth of a child you cant ignore the costs this imposes on the workplace
5551015 it shouldnt surprise us that anticipating the difficulties family oriented employees have in juggling work and home is a potential deterrent for employers and a source of discrimination in labour markets
5551016 by providing a return to work tax credit the government could turn the tables on employer costs associated with parental leave and turn it into a benefit rather than detriment that will encourage both leave and lead to important changes in workplace culture particularly towards women
5551017 our modelling suggests that the scheme would require little to no taxpayer contributions for the majority of families to which the loan would be targeted moreover the largest costs to the budget would emerge for those parents with the lowest lifetime incomes an attractive feature of the income contingent loan in this context is therefore that it provides not only liquidity but doubles as a social insurance instrument

5551064 ich will karriere in der politik machen im ffentlichen dienst deshalb muss ich mir mein eigenes bild machen um zu verstehen was hier passiert nicht nur vom h rensagen
5551065 freunde von uns haben die tour gemacht sie haben gesagt es wird sehr deprimierend
5551066 was jetzt kommt ist verr ckt wir fahren durch einen checkpoint der jerusalem und das westjordanland verbindet wenn wir wieder in die stadt zur ckkehren m ssten wir eigentlich scharf kontrolliert werden
5551067 was wir erlebt haben ist die ausnahme von der regel die frau hat tats chlich ihren job gemacht gefragt wo wir herkommen hat ins auto geschaut aber die meisten autos kommen ohne kontrolle durch wenn sie gelbe israelische nummerschilder haben wie wir das stellt die gesamte idee dieser extrem teuren sperranlage die uns vom westjordanland trennen und vor terror sch tzen soll in frage die anlage wird zum witz
5551068 daraus ergeben sich so viele fragen zum beispiel wie m ssen verschiedene kulturen lernen miteinander klar zu kommen es ist etwas entmutigend
5551069 ich verstehe nicht warum es nicht mehr opposition gibt vor allem wenn man sich an das j dische konzept von gerechtigkeit h lt dass auf joshua zur ckgeht vielleicht bin ich ja wirklich naiv aber ich verstehe es nicht in den vereinigten staaten sind viele linke juden und viele kriegsgegner schon w hrend des vietnamkriegs waren juden ich verstehe nicht warum diese einstellung hier nie angekommen ist

5551252 up to that point nobody was armed nobody threatened to get a weapon hoeft edenfield was the only one with a weapon wootton calls 911 before he gets stabbed from his friends cell phone he tells the police there are two guys here and one of them has a knife shortly after that there is physical engagement next thing you know the victim has a two and a half inch wound the knife goes right through the ribs and into the heart at the end of the fight theres only one guy who is dead nobody else is hurt except chris
5551253 he gets a ride to a friends place takes off his bloody clothes and washes
5551254 then the police take him into custody seems to me like a pretty clear cut case of murder
5551255 i dont know exactly what happened at this point as it is disputed
5551256 what is not disputed is that a small number of people was surrounded by a large number of people its an issue of unreasonable force it wasnt premeditated he hoeft edenfield had a pocket knife used to open boxes it was perfectly legal to use it for his job
5551257 there is no offense more serious than murder the alleged injury is death there is no injury greater than that after a cursory reading of this case it appears to me that a good number of people either participants or witnesses were involved
5551258 who first introduced a weapon into the fight before a large group of people got involved
5551259 then i reviewed a summary of the statement the defendant gave the police
5551260 there are three different versions which are not consistent the first was total denial the police overheard hoeft edenfield on the cell phone denying any involvement when the police presented him with evidence the story changes and he said it was an accidental stabbing the third version was self defense if i take the different versions that by itself would support conviction for murder rather than self defense the fact that he separated himself from his associates threw the knife away and washed the blood off these are further things that would add to it i am not convinced this is a self defense case there is substantial proof in the police report that this was a case of murder

5551270 i think this is also a wake up call to everyone that this is one problem that we really have to deal with
5551271 maybe in a roundtable discussion it will be good if this will be resolved instead of letting the guns do the talking so to speak
5551272 its like the milf is dramatizing their sentiment that they could use other means if they cant get their demands through the negotiation
5551273 they have already made their point they have made their statement heard if this is their way to show their point thats enough i hope they would be willing to go back to the negotiating table and go forward which is the only way we should go
5551274 maybe we should come up with some compromise because the old framework does not work anymore we should explore and be open to face the changes that might work
5551275 todays announcement represents an innovative approach to the r amp d productivity challenges our pharmaceutical clients are facing
5551276 we are very excited to welcome world class lilly scientific talent to covance and to take possession of valuable state of the art assets including more than 600 000 square feet of laboratory space and acquire new service lines that will help us accelerate our long term strategic growth plans covance will invest in this facility and maximize its capacity utilization by conducting substantial work with lilly and bring in new work from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients we expect the greenfield site to be a key contributor to the future growth and success of covance
5551277 this strategic agreement is a result of a long term trust based relationship between our two companies covance has proven they can help accelerate drug development timelines and improve efficiencies with lilly which will enable us to further focus on our core competencies in delivering better patient outcomes over the longer term
5551278 this industry pioneering alliance will provide lilly access to covances broad and efficient drug development platforms in addition this collaboration will help us make our fixed cost infrastructure more flexible and continue to grow our portfolio of best in class and first in class pharmaceutical products
5551279 we are disappointed but we understand celgenes decision given their recent withdrawal of the marketing authorization application for satraplatin in europe we plan to decide in the near future the next steps regarding the development of satraplatin and we will continue to focus our other efforts on advancing our rgb 286638 kinase inhibitor into the clinic and exploring various merger and acquisition opportunities
5551280 doctors clearly are not convinced that the new revalidation process will provide the benefits the government is citing
5551281 less than half agree that revalidation will enhance public confidence in the medical profession or ensure physicians keep more up to date
5551282 in addition the vast majority 84 do not feel that the new procedures will be successful in identifying another harold shipman the gp who murdered more than 200 people over 23 years as one of our respondents said harold shipman would have passed all of the validation requirements there is no system which will detect this type of aberrant behavior that view was echoed by most of the gps in our survey who pointed out that shipman was well liked and competent and that no revalidation system would expose a psychopath
5551283 overall only about half of gps see any good in the revalidation process and even fewer just 28 think it is long overdue
5551284 one of our respondents summed up what seems to be the predominant feeling calling the new process a shallow political gesture with no cost benefit evidence to support it another called it another costly exercise based on an unsound premise that pulls yet more time away from our patients still others spoke about potentially resigning or moving overseas clearly physicians have grave doubts about the new procedure and its potential effects

5551303 if anyone wanted to get off the bus bdh will help us implement an exit strategy just ring the bell and we will stop the bus
5551304 bdh are not fortune tellers they can not see into the future to see if an individual is cut out to run their own business
5551305 i think the point these people are making is that bdh do claim to be able to do these things not to mention it is a

5551307 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5551308 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5551309 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5551310 we really want to get the message out to people
5551311 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5551312 who is supposed to be more on top of financial things than a bank but banks made all these terrible mortgage loans and caused these disruptions and we are dependent on them for our financial security

5551321 consumers are increasingly active and activist about where they put their money
5551322 just giving money to charities through csr isnt enough anymore
5551323 that means that not only is it the right thing to do but it also makes economic sense i think thats a really important trend
5551324 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5551325 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party

5551339 the teaching of feminism is really the teaching of a religion
5551340 sounds like the first shocked response of men circa 1967 when feminism re emerged and when women started fighting for their rights
5551341 the equal protection argument is not that they dont take in men
5551342 its the negative impact they are having on guys because they demonize guys

5551348 in this time of the olympics there has to be an olympian effort to improve relationships between the city and albany in order to maintain mayoral control
5551349 there are some things that are really in jeopardy because when you talk to some of the legislators they are unhappy about how they have been treated
5551350 i think the doe sometimes gets a bum rap in that regard
5551351 i know that the chancellor and i have been meeting with legislators in their communities and even talking about ways we can improve that responsiveness
5551352 the response i got was well the principal of the school is his own ceo
5551353 if his definition of politics in the schools are special interest favors then none of us want politics in the schools but do we want good information yes do we want planning yes
5551354 what kind of politics is he trying to take out of the schools
5551355 is it when maybe a politician calls and says gee id love this kid in this class
5551356 everybody complains about three men in a room so what do you think about one man in a room
5551357 thats basically what happens the chancellor makes the decisions and everybody has to live with it

5551361 he was a batsman in top form but thats the way it goes in cricket you cant really stop and think about the guys you will be missing in the series rather than that you will have to fill in that space because that is the only way your team can win
5551362 we may look at a different combination of openers for the next game but its at a very initial stage we have just gone through the first game so whatever fits the team best well decide on that

5551400 it seems foolish to allow people on one side of the street be allowed to carry a concealed weapon and not allow them to cross the street onto campus
5551401 the answer is to have improved campus security and adequate resources given to our police department and law enforcement to protect the campus
5551402 it would be so dangerous be dangerous to everyone involved everybody around
5551403 its terrible to think about what might happen on campus and if it did im sure the regents would think twice about their policy
5551404 the gap in revenue per employee between google and sap and salesforce com for instance indicates that google would more likely be more interested in what ebay does or in monetizing youtube than in zoho or salesforce coms barely profitable business companies invest in what generates the best return on investment
5551405 googles margins are a once in a lifetime occurrence and google will move in that high growth why microsoft is so desperate about search it has a higher growth rate we are more worried about microsoft than google microsoft will address the internet but pulling down office margins is a challenge for them no company peacefully accepts a lowering of margins
5551406 our intention is to help erode microsofts profit margin coming in from below
5551407 if salesforce is a proxy it would be difficult for google to justify the investment more costs are associated with support than in r amp d even with on demand software the moment you have paying customers the expectations are different and google is finding that out with recent gmail problems
5551408 one of the privileges we enjoy as a private company is to not disclose revenue profit numbers which lets us do the kind of analysis on competitors they cant do on us
5551409 the internet has the potential to fundamentally improve access to care and the company has gained initial traction towards this long term vision

5551412 spectrum is very valuable and we want to make sure its being used as efficiently as possible
5551413 the idea of trying to utilize the white spaces from a consumer perspective would be a good win for everyone
5551414 when you look at low power fm or ultrawide band rules the technology has great promise but the commission adopted rules that constrained it to the detriment of consumers
5551415 so of course there are concerns that that the rules could be too limiting
5551416 what we cant support is a multibillion dollar spectrum giveaway to google and microsoft that threatens interference free television

5551476 the key piece here is a philosophical commitment to have a clean space that is well maintained bringing the whole community to the campus
5551477 the whole project is going to be seismically retrofitted energy efficient and accessible
5551478 the fences along mlk and channing way will have a four to five foot setback that will make the streets look better we want to create a visually pleasing campus setting
5551479 we are trying to match the way the school looks right now to unify the design
5551480 before we tear down the old gym everything in it with the exception of the warm water pool will be replaced in the new bleacher building he added
5551481 there will be a place to drop off students but no parking inside the campus
5551482 california statutes permit homeschooling as a species of private school education
5551483 i am pleased that the courts have clarified the right of california parents to homeschool their children
5551484 i have respected the right of parents to make educational decisions they feel are in the best interests of their children as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child i would point out that within californias education system there are many options available from independent study to charter schools to non classroom based programs
5551485 it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
5551486 i also appreciate the caution and concern taken by the court to protect children when their safety becomes an issue
5551487 i pulled my first son out of first grade to homeschool him because i thought it would be better for him than the school system
5551488 i was not satisfied by how business was being conducted at his private school and my younger son never went to regular school
5551489 it leaves homeschooling exactly where it belongs that is legal in the state of california without any kind of restraint or interference from the government i am a little disappointed the ruling said there should be some kind of legislation to define homeschooling in doing that regulations and restrictions might impede parents from teaching kids in the best possible way
5551490 my youngest son is 16 now and is going to community college
5551491 when you run for office you circulate a nomination paper on which you collect no more than 30 signatures
5551492 for nearly a year the enquirer had a serious candidate for the democrats presidential nominee cold as a usda rated prime grade rat who did not scruple to betray his ailing wife elizabeth while making political capital out of her condition then to enlist her as a co conspirator in lying to edwardss supporters and to the voters at large
5551493 edwards hunter was classically not a times like story said craig whitney the standards editor and im not going to recycle a supermarket tabloids anonymously sourced story said bill keller the executive editor
5551494 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5551495 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
5551496 theyve been betrayed by his action you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
5551497 but we didnt pass the additional costs on and still they stopped coming so i have no go broke if we didnt close
5551498 less than a year ago flour for instance cost 16 for a fifty pound bag now its 28 and thats nothing compared with other food costs
5551499 it used to be you could predict when you would be busy and when things would be slow
5551500 not any more i guess a lot of it depends on what happens on cable tv these days
5551501 i thought maybe customers stopped coming because they wanted a lighter fare
5551502 so i added pasta and more fresh fish things like that and the regulars complained what happened to the ham and beef stew so i went back to the tried and true menu keeping some of the new things still they stopped coming
5551503 he wanted to sell the business to an employee he helped me out a lot

5551506 my clientele especially seniors cant walk here they have to drive and if there are no parking spots they just keep going
5551507 i dont know well see what happens ive learned one thing anything is possible

5551511 what do you need to be the best concentration discipline most of all a dream
5551512 well we dont care because we dont believe in a jewish homeland or jewish self determination and we hope our daughter who was nearly an adult at the time will carry on for us and aid the nazi allied arab governments and their grand mufti who aided and encoruaged our extermination
5551513 we believe that product displayrestrictions are unnecessary ill conceived and will not deliverthe governments stated objectives to reduce tobaccoconsumption
5551514 if terry morgandoubts this is an industrial dispute he should try putting somemore money and better conditions on the table
5551515 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5551516 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5551517 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5551518 hey i appreciate your help in all honesty we chose to go with freedom debt because we felt you were sincere and honest as i was watching tv the other day i was seeing a commercial of one of your competitors and it reminded me of how tough a decision this was for us i am satisfied with our choice thanks for your help a

5551547 the degree and depth of whats happening in the financial industry is beyond anything weve seen in decades and it takes time to get your arms around the severity of whats happening and what the long term and short term ramifications are

5551583 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5551584 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5551585 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5551586 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5551587 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5551588 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5551589 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5551590 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5551591 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5551592 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something

5551598 dozens of east oakland residents turned out to arroyo viejo park on sunday afternoon for a day of free stand up comedy health programs and a tip of the hat to deceased comedian bernie mac
5551599 hundreds of people many from east oakland neighborhoods opened the inaugural comedy on the green celebration sunday at arroyo viejo community park not with a laugh but a moment of silence oakland comedian mark curry host and master of ceremonies began the afternoon of stand up comedy with a quiet moment for comedian bernie mac 50 who died saturday from what his publicist said were complications from pneumonia
5551600 partnered with oakland city councilwoman desley brooks on the event to give people a fun day
5551601 the assassination of a well known journalist the arrest of members of a local muslim group including a man who confessed to the shooting and seven other shootings over the last few days have left oakland residents reeling for some oakland residents especially those living in high crime areas the brazen daylight shooting of a public figure underscored that no one can take personal safety for granted on these streets for others it signaled the abysmal failure of the citys elected leaders to come up with a strategy to address the violence
5551602 what gets me most about our big picture mayor is that he continually ignores the big picture he talks on and on about tackling big ideas and empowering big visions while continually side stepping oaklands biggest issue public safety is the big picture issue mr mayor dont you get it for residents of rockridge east and west oakland crocker highlands adams point glenview and other neighborhoods where street crime is increasing the single biggest issue for residents is reducing crime
5551603 oakland residents are fed up with random crime from assaults to burglaries to armed robberies that is being carried out with seeming impunity on the citys streets whether the answer is more cops a restructured department or something else businesses and residents across the city want improvements in public safety and sooner rather than later
5551604 its clear given both the recent and past problems between the citys police department and some parts of the black community that any plan to beef up the department will have to be part of a major restructuring of the agency because as it stands now the department can provide neither the investigative and protection services desired in middle class neighborhoods and lacks the contacts reputation and community standing to make inroads in the citys toughest areas
5551605 but despite oaklands soaring crime rate and its sinking arrest rate mayor ron dellums is being dragged into a public debate about hiring more officers late last month dellums said he believed oakland residents didnt want a force larger than the 803 sworn officers authorized by a public bond measure but at a town hall meeting in north oakland on saturday he changed that tune describing the recruitment push as a rock bottom minimum number of officers and by the end of the meeting dellums was acquiescing to residents who called for a force as large as 1 000 officers the point brought home again and again by residents who attended the weekend town hall meeting was that public safety and adequate staffing levels for the police department should be the mayors top priority anything short of that including bans on bottled water and smoking at bus stops is small potatoes
5551606 oakland mayor ron dellums dropped a bombshell on monday announcing a plan to sponsor a november ballot measure to boost the police force by an additional 150 officers over the next three years by raising property taxes its the biggest news from dellums since he took office in january 2007 and if he can pull it off it would be the best thing thats happened to the city of oakland for years
5551607 in may when i supported the mayors plan to craft a ballot measure asking voters to approve a parcel tax to hire more police officers i heard from more than 150 angry readers most were residents unwilling to hand over another penny to the city that was the before city administrator deborah edgerlys dismissal the scandal involving the citys top administrator has further eroded the publics confidence in oaklands leadership
5551608 i support any reasonable affordable plan to bring the oakland police department up to speed and provide residents with a full complement of police services but not under these circumstances
5551609 i was one of those kids who knew exactly what they were going to do when they grew up
5551610 i knew that i would be in the service it was helicopters and it was going to be the army guard
5551611 what i think about when others see me in an external fashion is that this is not aberrant this can be normal
5551612 to be a helicopter pilot an aviator a national guardsman this is normal and i dont want to be seen as the exception there are women ahead of me im not breaking brush
5551613 its one of those things that reminds of the rigor that goes into the deployment and when you think things are awful they are not
5551614 it helps me remind me how good ive got it sometimes this particular one helps remind me that success is fragile it takes a lot to attain success and once you do its beautiful and exquisite but it doesnt take much to shatter it and break it
5551615 theres a small amount of trepidation that goes with going back into a combat zone but much less than the first time
5551616 this time i know exactly what to expect i can say of the 359 days i spent on the first tour that i could count on two hands how many times i was actually shot at and could count on two fingers the number of times i was probably in mortal danger so out of 359 days those are incredible odds
5551617 one country doesnt want another country to be there they dont want the country to exist so they bomb it

5551628 i lay out in the sun because people would stare at my white body that looks like a glow stick and make fun of my whiteness
5551629 when i lay out in the sun i dont think im gonna look gross when im older and have cancer
5551630 i wear sunscreen because anytime i dont i get fried and look like a lobster
5551631 ill put sunscreen on them and theyll jump in the pool and about an hour and a half later itll be washed off
5551632 i always try to reapply because there is nothing worse than having your kid hurting with a sunburn
5551633 the skin cells of a baby are healthy and look like a tightly woven basket whereas someone who is older and has been exposed to the sun might have skin cells that look like scrambled eggs
5551634 sunblock just like its name physically reflects or blocks the uva and uvb radiation from the skin sunscreens actually absorb the ultraviolet radiation and give it off as heat
5551635 however you should still reapply every three to four hours because most sunscreens only last that long anyways

5551645 a 2003 article in egypts al haqiqa newspaper quoting ali goma defending terrorist acts in israel
5551646 what i actually said is that islam prohibits a muslim from changing his religion and that apostasy is a crime which must be punished
5551647 o n the matter of support for ali goma it seems rather ironic that right wing critics share their worries over our stance probably to their horror with marxists on the far left such as the uk guardians seamus milne

5551651 todays announcement represents an innovative approach to the r amp d productivity challenges our pharmaceutical clients are facing
5551652 we are very excited to welcome world class lilly scientific talent to covance and to take possession of valuable state of the art assets including more than 600 000 square feet of laboratory space and acquire new service lines that will help us accelerate our long term strategic growth plans covance will invest in this facility and maximize its capacity utilization by conducting substantial work with lilly and bring in new work from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients we expect the greenfield site to be a key contributor to the future growth and success of covance
5551653 this strategic agreement is a result of a long term trust based relationship between our two companies covance has proven they can help accelerate drug development timelines and improve efficiencies with lilly which will enable us to further focus on our core competencies in delivering better patient outcomes over the longer term
5551654 this industry pioneering alliance will provide lilly access to covances broad and efficient drug development platforms in addition this collaboration will help us make our fixed cost infrastructure more flexible and continue to grow our portfolio of best in class and first in class pharmaceutical products

5551659 doctors clearly are not convinced that the new revalidation process will provide the benefits the government is citing
5551660 less than half agree that revalidation will enhance public confidence in the medical profession or ensure physicians keep more up to date
5551661 in addition the vast majority 84 do not feel that the new procedures will be successful in identifying another harold shipman the gp who murdered more than 200 people over 23 years as one of our respondents said harold shipman would have passed all of the validation requirements there is no system which will detect this type of aberrant behavior that view was echoed by most of the gps in our survey who pointed out that shipman was well liked and competent and that no revalidation system would expose a psychopath
5551662 overall only about half of gps see any good in the revalidation process and even fewer just 28 think it is long overdue
5551663 one of our respondents summed up what seems to be the predominant feeling calling the new process a shallow political gesture with no cost benefit evidence to support it another called it another costly exercise based on an unsound premise that pulls yet more time away from our patients still others spoke about potentially resigning or moving overseas clearly physicians have grave doubts about the new procedure and its potential effects

5551720 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5551721 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5551722 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5551723 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5551724 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5551725 it was important for the team and for me and overall it was a very positive weekend the car worked well i did a lot of laps during free practice on friday and saturday morning and i was on the pace all weekend and felt comfortable its always nice to have that sort of weekend and i hope to continue like this for the rest of the season
5551726 this season i have already learned several new circuits but the difference this time is that all the drivers will be in the same position and having to learn the circuit
5551727 i think that from the point of view of the championship its interesting to visit new tracks its an extra challenge for the drivers as well as the teams i have worked hard with the team to approach this race in the best shape possible and i will try to get on the pace quickly and maximise every lap in practice
5551728 i would like to have another solid weekend starting off with a good day of practice on friday qualifying in the top 10 and showing good race pace to hopefully finish in the points
5551729 thats how i will approach this race after the summer break i am well rested and motivated to have a great end to the season
5551730 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5551731 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5551732 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5551733 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5551734 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5551735 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from
5551736 when i was a kid there was an ice storm in the suburbs we went to manhattan to stay with a friend of my moms there was nobody on the road it was this moment that couldve been scary for a kid but she made it festive

5551748 the tragedy of our day is the climate of fear which we live and fear breathes repression too often sinister threats to the bill of rights to freedom of the mind are concealed under the patriotic cloak of anti communism
5551749 its far easier to fight for principles than live up to them
5551750 these are the final efforts being made by the icc to convince the teams who are not happy with the security situation in pakistan that everything is in order in pakistan
5551751 it is a dicey situation for the icc as some countries are citing advice from their foreign offices not to travel to pakistan at this stage due to increasing threats from taliban in this scenario there is nothing much the icc can do to force them to change their minds
5551752 we didnt have jobs so people have moved on i guess some would say theyve gone to the mining industry i believe a lot have gone out of that and on to other things as well
5551753 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now
5551754 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5551755 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5551756 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5551757 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5551758 aston villa has been extremely supportive of me going to the olympics and being a part of that and then being called in for the guatemala game
5551759 these games are important for players to be a part of to be able to represent your country and for the experience i think they understand that and they have been terrific at being pretty flexible with my past few weeks here
5551760 its a long year its a long season ahead of us for a young player like myself to have the experiences that i have been able to have and am going to have playing with the national team those games are important yes ive missed some time in saying that its not as if im sitting over here twiddling my thumbs im picking up some valuable experience in different national team environments
5551761 its a big jump but in saying that i think im ready for it
5551762 im ready for this new adventure thats hopefully going to help my career and help me as a player its going to be exciting i know its not all going to be easy going into the premier league its one of the best leagues in the world if not the best with the best players in the world
5551763 i have spoken with the coaching staff a bit and being a young goalkeeper in my first year in the premiership there are going to be some things that im going to need to learn and get used to i think that was part of the reason why they signed a great veteran goalkeeper like brad friedel
5551764 i am looking forward to working with him day in and day out
5551765 to learn from his experiences as an international player and as a premiership player will be a huge benefit everywhere hes played hes been successful so to have him as a mentor and to be able to train with him everyday is going to be a huge benefit for me
5551766 they have set the bar for young guys like myself hopefully i will be able to follow in their footsteps and be at least half as successful as theyve been theyve just been absolutely outstanding over there theyve done a tremendous job of keeping that pipeline of american goalkeepers going and for them setting the bar so high it has given guys like myself an opportunity
5551767 going in ill have to make some adjustments but hopefully i can just grow and get better as a player
5551768 im very thankful for the players and coaching staff that ive had for the past three and a half years and for chivas usa giving me the opportunity to fulfill my dream of being a professional
5551769 being my first professional club i will always remember it
5551770 ill always remember my experiences and my time there especially those difficult times that first year i think being able to overcome that first year was important not only physically but mentally as well for me that has helped me become who i am today
5551771 obviously it was a a bit disappointing in terms of us not advancing
5551772 but in the overall experience it was great to be a part of it i think it was something that im always going to remember for the rest of my life the other guys as well it was an experience that not many people get to be a part of to be able to have that and enjoy it was very important
5551773 were pleased we are finally able to bring gabriel to the revolution
5551774 he is a strong versatile defender who has gained tremendous club and international experience at a young age with so many extra games on our schedule this season gabriel will give us added defensive depth as we prepare for a busy fall

5551781 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5551782 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5551783 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5551784 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs have shown great progress
5551785 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5551786 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5551787 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5551788 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory

5551838 this legislation authorizes a study of the inequities of the current need analysis formula that many of us have argued was very unfair to students who live in high cost areas of the country
5551839 a household income of 40 000 simply does not go as far in oakland as it does in des moines iowa and the current formula has never taken that into account giving families in both areas the same
5551840 i am delighted that the senate has joined the house in swiftly passing this landmark legislation
5551841 this legislation will empower americas college consumers students and families by providing them with comprehensive information on tuition and textbook prices and key financial protections when paying for a college degree for students and parents who continue to face soaring college costs amidst rough economic times these reforms could not come soon enough i hope that the president will join our continuing efforts to make college more affordable and accessible by quickly signing this bill into law

5551862 the evidence that two other members of his aau basketball team transferred to scott county high school could give rise to an inference that there was collusion on the part of these students to transfer to scott county high school however there is no evidence that was presented at the appeals hearing that would support a conclusion based on such an inference
5551863 there was not any evidence presented at this hearing to establish any collusion by these students and scott county high to circumvent the established rules for eligibility of transferring students

5551905 mark burnett wants to know why howie mandel got an emmy nom
5551906 im just as surprised as you are to see that deal or no deal is considered a reality show and not a game show burnett doesnt think its fair that you have someone like jeff probst who hosts an unscripted show like survivor put up against people who host talent shows and game shows
5551907 i think its the amount of time they focus on the contestants and the family members on stage and the tears and the personal stories that tip some prime time game shows into the reality realm

5551912 brower wrote i spent my youth on haste street in a house now almost hidden by a redwood i planted there in 1941 hoping we could mature together
5551913 i thought that was remarkable i had no idea he grew up in the south campus the fact that his early home and the tree he planted could have survived all the decades of demolition and turmoil in that neighborhood was wonderful the forward was written by brower on nov 8 1996 and i read it in the early 2000s after he died
5551914 we had some long stops and starts while other things took priority but the application was finally finished
5551915 the brower center is nice but it is concrete and steel the house and tree are more appropriate to who my father was he was pretty dynamic he tried to save wildness for future generations sometimes he would put ads in the new york times and the san francisco chronicle about saving the environment
5551916 this was a place where a lot of his opinions and ideas were formed
5551917 i think it laid the foundation for the rest of his life
5551918 at the climax of a struggle over the direction of the organization
5551919 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5551920 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5551921 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5551922 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5551923 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5551924 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5551925 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5551926 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5551927 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5551928 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5551929 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5551930 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5551931 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5551932 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5551933 i dont like him and i dont like his face
5551934 a little more exercise might really help you feel better
5551935 you are doing such a great job as a mom i dont know how you do it all especially with your illness i really admire your perseverance and strength

5551972 we found that small and medium scale enterprises do not fully use soft innovations like branding marketing and management strategies to its full potential

5551980 its going to be four days of grueling competition and youve just got to get from one round to the next
5551981 this is very beneficial because we plan on being in that race next year

5551985 officials told us if liu could not win a gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements would become meaningless

5551988 its just impossible for him to run but he still doesnt want to give up i have just spoken to liu outside and he is very depressed
5551989 it is a very hard moment for all of us
5551990 to beleive him not just when i accept christ as savior but every moment one moment at a time this is the christian life and this is true spirituality
5551991 i am very satisfied with the success of the project
5551992 everybody here in berkeley was very receptive especially school board president john selawsky and former superintendent michele lawrence
5551993 the cost was divided between the state and the busd the district realized that the school was allowed to collect modernization funds from the state the state put up 60 percent of the cost and the district put up 40 percent the district got the money from using their pg amp e rebates along with bond money they didnt even have to take out any loans
5551994 we started this project for several reasons firstly we wanted to set a good example for the students renewable energy is good for the planet secondly we wanted to become more green and lastly we saw that it had a financial benefit it reduced our electrical bills
5551995 in the future not only are we planning to install solar panels on our new district office we want to do these projects at our other schools
5551996 we want to get berkeley high school to have solar panels
5551997 she accomplished so much and touched so many lives in the short time she was with us

5551999 she was a student of the world and strongly believed in immersing herself into new cultures through her experiences with programs such as amigos mexico india education abroad and the philippines fulbright hays scholarship she became a force for social justice
5552000 our esteemed colleague kalpna mistry passed away this past week and will be sorely missed
5552001 she will be remembered by her dedication to education her deep love of her students and great intellect
5552002 i was fortunate to teach across the hall from kalpna at berkeley high
5552003 whether it was bringing in food for her students to teach about a new culture organizing a class kiva loan or talking about curriculum with us teachers kalpna constantly impressed and inspired me she was a rock star teacher highly regarded among her colleagues and students and a cherished friend my thoughts and prayers go out to her family
5552004 well at one point i was failing that class and she met with me and my mom and set me up with a folder in her classroom where i could put all my work and i pulled my grade up to a c rather quickly
5552005 she was very creative in how we were to do our assignments she was also very helpful and i feel she genuinely made me a better learner
5552006 ms mistry was the only teacher who has ever really believed in me
5552007 im still grappling with this news as im sure you all are
5552008 its just so hard to believe its devastating kalpna was one of my best friends growing up kalpna had such a huge influence on me in ways im sure she didnt even know in sixth grade she convinced me to try out for the volleyball team a sport i immediately fell in love with and continue to play today her kindness generosity and honest to god care for those in need throughout the world showed me what it is to be compassionate and her unassuming brilliance showed me what it is to be humble yet push myself beyond what i think im capable of

5552029 we dont like to take any chances and bayer has some controversy in its history
5552030 we dont like to take any chances and bayer has some controversy in its history
5552031 however when we have extra pages or run special editions such as spirit week senior pages or the april fools edition it can cost as much as 1 000 for an issue so for the year we need between 12 000 16 000 and as of now we only have 4 500 so we are looking to the community to raise between 8 000 and 10 000
5552032 my advice has been to get more subscribers more advertisers and to raise prices appropriately
5552033 before i took over we didnt do a lot of advertising and it wasnt a great source of revenue we made a conscious effort though and i think they need to continue to use advertising as a source of revenue
5552034 we are trying to involve the community as much as we can
5552035 we want to have an event with berkeley writers and reporters who will donate their time to speak to people in the community at an event benefitting the newspaper
5552036 people in the audience can hear them speak ask questions it will be a fun event we are also thinking about holding a silent auction at that event it will probably happen in mid to late fall
5552037 the jacket has prided itself on being completely financially independent from berkeley high
5552038 this is a student run newspaper and we want to remain independent
5552039 i think that i noticed these things even before school started last year
5552040 we were getting less subscribers since a lot of subscribers were parents whose kids graduated that year printing costs also went up two or three times this past year as well as the price of stamps so these financial problems came from a variety of factors
5552041 the day i married you the day all my dreams came true
5552042 it was pretty much a one person program this puts a lot of pressure on everyone terry kept thinking he would be well enough to do it but found out at the last minute that he was really sick
5552043 there are two real tragedies to not being able to publish this month
5552044 the information and contributions we hoped to get out wont get out anymore it also puts the vendors in jeopardy however street sheet has graciously agreed to print more copies to help us we would like to have more staff but its really expensive to run the program in the first place
5552045 street spirit serves a twofold purpose it has important news on homeless issues and it allows people to make money i am happy they have worked out something with street sheet because honestly these people need the income
5552046 terry takes all the contributions and edits them the paper usually comes out on the first of every month its very disappointing that it didnt happen this month especially because theres so much going on and a number of people have written about important things i am very concerned about terry he has been working really hard recently
5552047 the story of mary jesus was the story of heartless landlord policies
5552048 there are important things people bring attention to rasputin featured a lot of our artists on its windows recently because their statement about homelessness was so strong these contributions are more than just stories these are advocacy pieces and the voices of people whose voices are not heard otherwise
5552049 we get the papers to them and they screen the vendors
5552050 the number of vendors are down right now we have only 50 to 60 people distributing street spirit earlier it used to be more like 125 its something we are looking into right now
5552051 its really a pittance but it adds up in the long run
5552052 we have avoided advertisers for a while but now it seems we need to do it
5552053 we are certainly open to accepting financial help if people want to make donations i am currently working on kicking off our website which will have more information for everyone

5552065 from our standpoint the settlement falls far short of the goals we were trying to achieve
5552066 the agreement is good for the campus and good for santa cruz
5552067 to meet its mission of teaching research and public service and includes mutually enforceable measures to address traffic impacts conserve water and provide housing for new students

5552084 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website

5552114 you can laugh at me for saying one year at a time but thats the reality for me
5552115 everyone in task force helmand is affected by the death of a soldier and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family at this most difficult time
5552116 i dont think my mind set has changed any since april
5552117 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5552118 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5552119 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5552120 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5552121 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5552122 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5552123 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5552124 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5552125 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5552126 one said she had never experienced such terror in her life judge clayton said
5552127 she said she feared for her life she believed she was going to die
5552128 we are tired of fighting we are tired of being courageous we are tired of winning we are tired of defeating our enemies we want them to be our friends our partners our good neighbors
5552129 obama was caught red handed in his attempt to deceive the american people when nrlc released these official documents
5552130 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
5552131 so for people to suggest that i somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong
5552132 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and forcalling us liars
5552133 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5552134 we arrived at saddleback and went into a holding room which is a separate building from the main church in the room there were four or five staff people plus mccain and there was no tv no audio no nothing we talked through a few of the topics we had spent time in the afternoon preparing doing q amp a and we did a few more questions to warm him up at about ten til six the advance guys came to get mccain to take him to the stage because the handshake with obama was a few minutes before 6 p m mccain never heard any of this stuff
5552135 my mother has end stage leukaemia and we had to get a carer in who worked for the primary care trust pct the next day my mum said 40 had gone out of her purse
5552136 i said are you sure and she said i may be dying but i know how much money i had in my handbag
5552137 emma wrote down the serial numbers on three 20 notes in my mums purse and we got a 55 camera from the local diy store emma said the camera lens was just like the eye of the teddy bear in the house so we put the camera inside
5552138 we thought it would be a long process but allen was greedy we called the police and showed them the footage and gave them the serial numbers
5552139 their opinions are rooted in so much misguided subjectivism that even a bulldozer couldnt budge them
5552140 could you imagine if you were to take halo and offer it free to play how much money do you think some people would spend on halo if they had a huge array of items that they could buy i recon theres a cap out at about usd 10 000 when you think about it the most we ask for is usd 60 and when you get those people spending a lot of money it brings the average up on acclaim games right now we average usd 75 per person
5552141 well the trial is proceeding we feel really good about our claims and were hopeful that justice will be done
5552142 we all feel really strongly that they have defrauded us and a major portion of the industry
5552143 well here i am what do you need me to do here
5552144 stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau

5552149 majority of australians think the country is taking too many refugees
5552150 i was really really broken up about it because i thought he had a chance to make it and he was really a strong fella i thought he would make a recovery and possibly come home and im just devastated by it
5552151 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5552152 this was a serious misstep by the obama campaign and his supporters could best help him by never mentioning it again
5552153 heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was the consequence of an induced abortion
5552154 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney policies he helped perpetuate four years ago
5552155 but that doesnt mean that the obama campaign shouldnt hew closer to the truth
5552156 i wont vote for obama but im not sure what ill do
5552157 he was just waking up to the thought that women around the country were upset over the treatment of hillary
5552158 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis
5552159 has for the past four years blatantly misrepresented his actions on the illinois born alive infant protection bill
5552160 voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
5552161 inasmuch as youve done it unto the least of these you have also done it unto me
5552162 i happen to be in the kingdom of god my kingdom is not of this world and sometimes when people dont understand that they want you to be on their political bandwagon
5552163 jesus agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking
5552164 if obama ever establishes any kind of trust with evangelicals there will be a noticeable shift
5552165 it will not be huge but it will be significant
5552166 number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
5552167 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion
5552168 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say
5552169 after having been an occupied nation for over 150 years we have asked the united states government to leave our country meanwhile until the united states government leaves lakotah territory we will take every opportunity to insist it follow its own laws and that its states do the same
5552170 according to the civil right act federal marshalls should arrest any state official who tries to stop lakotah from entering the park and fishing however if the united states ignores its own laws to deny lakotah rights it will certainly not be the first time

5552243 commodore bainimarama at the pacific island leaders forum in tonga in october last year gave a faithful and unconditional undertaking to have an election in fiji before the end of march next year mr smith told sky news
5552244 he was compelled as a matter of honour to turn up to the forum and explain himself to the leaders
5552245 it is very disappointing that he wont turn up to effectively take his medicine
5552246 so its very disappointing and i think the leaders in niue including our own prime minister will understandably be very gravely disappointed at the refusal of commodore bainimarama to turn up

5552253 los argentinos no podemos hacernos cargo de la deuda oscura de aerolineas
5552254 aerol neas es una empresa privada que tiene un mal servicio y una deuda muy grande y los argentinos no podemos hacer cargo de una deuda que estoy seguro que es oscura producto de una defraudaci n
5552255 cuando marsans compr la empresa la compro a un valor simb lico de un euro y despu s siete u ocho a os m s tarde deja la empresa con menos activos y una deuda de 900 millones de d lares
5552256 el pasivo es mas alto que el activo y es b sicamente la reestatizaci n de un robo perpetrado por marsans asegur en se al de rechazo del proyecto oficialista que busca el traspaso de aerol neas a manos del estado
5552257 esta no es la manera de proceder y por eso creemos que es necesario crear una nueva aerol nea hay que generar una nueva flota
5552258 hoy se tienen 85 naves y solo funcionan 35 adem s una sola es propia porque el resto son alquilados o est n en leasing
5552259 se debe lograr una flota homog nea y al estado y a la sociedad le conviene tener una empresa eficiente y con menor recursos hemos hablado con t cnicos y advierten que poner en funcionamiento a la empresa llevar a a cuatro meses tiempo durante el cual el gobierno deber a mantener la operatividad de aerol neas tal como lo hace hoy
5552260 nadie esta de acuerdo con comprar la deuda y nadie conoce cuales son los activos
5552261 las inconveniencias para sostener el proyecto son muchas y se trata de un proceso fraudulento que dif cilmente los legisladores puedan avalar
5552262 they are measures that we will oppose in principle mr ciobo said in sky news today
5552263 from our perspective this government is clearly pursuing some wrong priorities
5552264 so we have taken a decision to oppose measures that we frankly dont believe are in the national interest
5552265 as a result of labors proposed reform we will actually see up to a million people moving from the private system back onto our already under resourced public hospital queues he said
5552266 that is going to compound problems and make them worse
5552267 we certainly wont be doing anything to jeopardise the governments financial position

5552287 the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile is a dramatic acceleration for synchronica and i believe that it will build value for our shareholders we aim to build a world leader in the market of consumer mobile email and synchronization solutions and this acquisition is a key milestone which will improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our commercial growth it will increase our ability to sell to customers particularly to those in emerging economies where we see the largest potential growth for mobile email and synchronization with the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile synchronica now has sufficient mass and funding to take advantage of the outstanding opportunity to exploit the commercial potential of mass market mobile email the next few years will be an exciting time for us all here at synchronica and for our customers around the globe we look forward with increased confidence from this inflection point
5552288 this is the start of an exciting new era for axismobile and our customers there are real synergies between synchronicas products and target markets and our own so it makes great commercial sense to combine forces both companies are committed to open standards and to developing products that work on even the most basic of handsets a must given that the market for mass market mobile email is being fuelled by demand from the developing world we are confident that the combined might of our two companies will prove to be greater than the sum of its parts

5552300 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5552301 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5552302 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5552303 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5552304 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5552305 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5552306 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5552307 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5552308 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5552309 getting rid of the lignin barrier and making the cellulose more accessible is the most expensive and environmentally unfriendly part of making ethanol from biomass
5552310 the tracking system is deployed and working which is great news
5552311 we started ultrasonic tagging programs in maine in 1997 and have learned much about salmon ecology in the estuaries and bays of the gulf of maine
5552312 our team is really excited that fish from our most recent work in the penobscot river have been detected so far along on their migration northward the first data provided valuable information about how long it took atlantic salmon from the penobscot river to reach halifax
5552313 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5552314 broad scale ocean arrays such as the halifax array are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5552315 we have three researchers in the labrador sea right now working with canadian colleagues as part of the international salmon at sea salsea project to determine where atlantic salmon are and are not and to try to get detailed genetic and dietary information about the various north atlantic salmon stocks
5552316 atlantic salmon are an iconic fish but theyre endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population

5552545 senator barack obama has all but settled on his choice for a running mate and set an elaborate rollout plan for his decision beginning with an early morning alert to supporters perhaps as soon as wednesday morning aides said
5552546 going into the final days mr obama was said to be focused mainly on three candidates senator evan bayh of indiana gov tim kaine of virginia and senator joseph r biden jr of delaware
5552547 some democrats said they still hoped that he would choose senator hillary rodham clinton of new york or gov kathleen sebelius of kansas who has been under steady consideration by mr obamas campaign
5552548 obama was caught red handed in his attempt to deceive the american people when nrlc released these official documents
5552549 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
5552550 so for people to suggest that i somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong
5552551 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and forcalling us liars
5552552 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5552553 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5552554 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5552555 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5552556 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5552557 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5552558 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5552559 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5552560 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5552561 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5552562 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5552563 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5552564 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die

5552705 a lot of people are burning wood who havent burned wood before and people are burning wood because its half the price of oil pretty much
5552706 know that its a lot of work its not a clean product like putting oil into your tank
5552707 i think its great that people are using more wood now to help reduce the carbon footprint that the fossil fuels have definitely put on this earth
5552708 right now in the county were blessed with an overabundance of the best firewood on the planet and the performance of wood stoves has never been better
5552709 a system lasts 30 to 40 years at least it pays off
5552710 we already refitted the kanata club here with geothermal heating weve taken away our need for oil
5552711 were hoping by the end of next year to be 100 per cent sustainable on our own and off the grid altogether just for this complex here then well look at options at getting the whole community involved
5552712 with that will be everything from start to finish it will be the two turbines equipment thats delivery taxes installation invertors the whole thing
5552713 with the money well be saving were thinking within eight years well have the full cost recovered
5552714 having the geothermal and the wind turbines will probably save us 25 000 a year
5552715 but because there is a wait to get the actual turbines in it could be later theyll definitely be up by next spring
5552716 they will be going in and around the kanata club i dont know if they know exactly the spot right yet
5552717 we wanted to set an example for everyone in our community with the cost of oil were trying to cut down our costs
5552718 were hoping to keep going with it its a great plan

5552740 these amendments were considered by cabinet in the context of recent debate about jury trials
5552741 thereve been a couple of cases where this issue has been the subject of public debate cabinet is part of that debate but these amendments have not been designed with any particular trial in mind
5552742 in controversial trials the only way to deal with recent problems is to allow questioning of jurors
5552743 we support judge only trials subject to seeing the fine print

5552901 it makes me sad to see a business representing itself in a way that supposedly appeals to christian churches they promote themselves as being a christian company but to make this kind of disingenuous argument to exclude people in churches on an arbitrary distinction based on sexual orientation without any genuine risk is inconsistent with basic christian doctrine and its an insult to the community to assume that in our community people would react in a violent fashion against a church that takes an inclusive welcoming position

5553189 in 2000 taking that year off from fresno state and trying out for the olympic team made me a better wrestler
5553190 it gave me the opportunity to focus on international wresting and freestyle i was a match away from making that team but it really prepared me for 2004
5553191 i had a lot of good guys around me at fresno state that helped me wrestle hard and prepare
5553192 the team always pushed me and helped me stay physically fit i also had a lot of support from the school and community and im really grateful for that

5553196 i continue to train and i tried to make this team this year and just retired in july
5553197 im going to continue to work with wrestling in some way and plan to open a wrestling school in fresno and share my knowledge of wresting with people in the valley

5553199 daniel cormier was on the olympic team with me in 2004 and has a great chance to medal and get gold the rest of the team is young but if they can do well they can surprise a lot of people

5553226 the underground area was so hot there were 897 people there and they had to wait until they finished their performance
5553227 so altogether they had to stay there for six to seven hours and they could not even go to the toilet so they all wore nappies
5553228 with all the spectators coming into the stadium the performers have to prepare in advance
5553229 every performer should stay in a fixed place at a fixed time

5553250 theres a bit of a down draft from what happened in the u s overnight and commodities are a bit weak too
5553251 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5553252 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field

5553255 some of these child care centers are precariously close to closing their doors
5553256 if parents cant have their children safely in day care then some may not be able to go to work it could really have a ripple effect on the economy we need to have a budget and it has to be good for kids
5553257 its really sad they cant pass the budget theyre getting their salaries and benefits and continuing to collect our taxes its like a kick in the face
5553258 everything thats not happening in sacramento trickles down to thousands of people anxiously waiting for the state to make up its mind to pay for services they contracted for everybodys costs continue do we have to wait for disaster before we act
5553259 you lay down at night and pray and hope for things to happen in another month or so its going to get really ugly its not going to be good for the kids

5553262 the book has beautiful pictures and wonderful ideas i wish it would identify all flowers and amounts used in the boquets i thought it might be more of an instructional book it is a good reference
5553263 i found this book useful in that it was simple straight forward guide to the most common flowers used in weddings the first half is essentially a glossary of flowers it provides basic information that made it easy to compare flowers photo meaning colors available when in season and price range the book also provides information on bouquet styles color schemes and flower arrangments but i found the single flower photos most educational
5553264 the book has full page color picture of dozens of bouquets divided by season there is a wide variety of colors and styles to satisfy almost anyone to have and to hold also provides interesting twists on bouquets like adding berries feathers or holding a small book with a flower as a bookmark along with pictures of bouquets it also shows how to incorporate some of the flowers into other parts of the wedding boutonnieres flower girls and cake toppers the pictures have captions that provide the flower names and sometimes descripitions of flower variations and when the best seasons are for the specific flowers which is really helpful
5553265 betapa besarnya perhatian gerakan ahmadiyah tentang perjuangan kemerdekaan bangsa kita dapat diketahui dari surat surat kabar harian dan risalah risalah dalam bahasa urdu yang baru baru ini diterima dari india dalam surat surat kabar tersebut dijumpai banyak sekali berita berita dan karangan karangan yang membentangkan sejarah perjuangan kita soal soal yang berhubungan dengan keadaan ekonomi dan politik negara biografi pemimpin pemimpin kita terjemahan dari undang undang dasar negara republik indonesia dan lain lain
5553266 jika bangsa indonesia akan mendapat kemerdekaannya 100 tentulah hal itu akan berfaedah dengan dunia islam untuk hal itu ada baiknya jika negara negara islam pada masa ini dengan serentak memperdengarkan suaranya untuk mengakui kemerdekaan indonesia serta meminta negara negara lain juga mengakuinya selain itu saya berharap supaya seluruh mubaligh utusan ahmadiyah yang kini ada di india dan di luar india yaitu palestina mesir iran afrika eropa kanada amerika serikat amerika selatan dan lain lain mendengungkan serta menulis dalam surat surat kabar harian dan majalah majalah yang mereka keluarkan karangan karangan yang berhubungan dengan perjuangan kemerdekaan bangsa indonesia khususnya meminta kepada negara negara islam untuk membantu bangsa indonesia mencapai kemerdekaannya soal kemerdekaan indonesia harus tiap tiap waktu didengung dengungkan supaya negar negara di dunia ini memperhatikan hal itu sudah menjadi haknya bangsa indonesia untuk merdeka di masa ini bangsa ini adalah bangsa yang maju memiliki peradaban yang tinggi dan memiliki pemimpin pemimpin yang bijaksana mereka adalah suatu bangsa yang besar dan bersatu bangsa belanda yang jumlahnya kecil sekali kali tidak berhak untuk memerintah mereka

5553280 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5553281 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5553282 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5553283 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
5553284 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
5553285 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer
5553286 all those who wherever they are will pray for the spiritual goals of this meeting and for its happy outcome
5553287 the youth meeting held in the year 2005 in cologne offered the apostolic penitentiary an opportune occasion with the authority of the supreme pontiff to open wide to youth the spiritual treasures of the church with the aim of gathering singular fruits of sanctification
5553288 hence this year from 15 to 20 july in sydney in the great southern land of the holy spirit according to the expression of john paul ii will celebrate the 23rd world youth day with the theme you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses
5553289 young people gathered around the vicar of christ will participate in the sacred functions and above all have recourse to the sacraments of reconciliation and the eucharist in the sacraments received with a sincere and humble heart they will earnestly desire to strengthen themselves in the spirit and confirmed by the chrism of salvation will openly witness the faith before others even to the ends of the earth may god grant that the very presence of the supreme pontiff among the young people gathered in sydney express and render it such
5553290 the partial indulgence is granted to the faithful wherever they are during the above mentioned meeting if at least with a contrite spirit they will raise their prayer to god the holy spirit so that young people are drawn to charity and given the strength to proclaim the gospel with their life
5553291 so that all the faithful may more easily obtain these heavenly gifts priests who have received legitimate approval to hear sacramental confessions should welcome them with a ready and generous spirit and suggest public prayers to the faithful for the success of the same world youth day

5553294 theres a sense that origin has gotten quite a positive response on its csg monetisation process but thats still in early days so its hard to decide which is a better option
5553295 its difficult to say what bg might do theres a high chance they will wait until they get more details on the csg monetisation proposals origin has received but they could also make a pre emptive strike and launch a higher offer
5553296 the hurricane season is still a major issue as seen in 2005 with katrina we have to be mindful of that

5553301 it is such a privilege to announce the upcoming expansions for two of our most popular games everquest and everquest ii in a venue like fan faire where we are joined by thousands of our loyal fans and it seems more than appropriate to give those fans access to both of the expansions for free

5553326 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5553327 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5553328 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5553329 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5553330 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion

5553332 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child
5553333 animal rights groups are entitled to their opinion but many people do not share this opinion and it is certainly not reflected in the rising global demand for fur
5553334 regrettably not everyone understands the difference between animal welfare which has the full commitment of our sector and animal rights which seeks to ban every animal use by man whether for food medical or scientific research clothing or companionship

5553351 bayi dengan berat 1 600 gram pun tidak apa apa melakukan imd asal kondisinya stabil

5553353 sebab dada ibu yang baru melahirkan suhunya 2 derajat celcius lebih tinggi dibanding dada ibu yang tidak melahirkan jadi bayi tetap hangat kalau bayi merasa kepanasan suhu dada ibu akan otomatis turun 1 derajat celcius itulah keajaiban tuhan
5553354 ayahnya bisa membantu mengarahkan bayi ke puting ibunya tapi bukan langsung menyodorkan puting ibunya ke bayi lho cukup dipandu saja keberadaan ayah di situ juga bisa mengawasi bayi agar tidak jatuh dari dada ibunya karena itu keterlibatan ayah dalam imd juga penting
5553355 kalau mereka bersedia pegang janjinya untuk tidak memisahkan anda dan bayi segera setelah ia lahir sebab tidak dipisahkan dari bayi adalah hak anda kalau mereka tidak mau lebih baik cari dokter atau tempat bersalin lain yang bersedia

5553360 penghasilan dan profesi dapat diambil zakatnya bila sudah setahun dan cukup senisab jika kita berpegang kepada pendapat abu hanifah abu yusuf dan muhammad bahwa nisab tidak perlu harus tercapai sepanjang tahun tapi cukup tercapai penuh antara dua ujung tahun tanpa kurang di tengah tengah kita dapat menyimpulkan bahwa dengan penafsiran tersebut memungkinkan untuk mewajibkan zakat atas hasil penghasilan setiap tahun karena hasil itu jarang terhenti sepanjang tahun bahkan kebanyakan mencapai kedua sisi ujung tahun tersebut berdasar hal itu kita dapat menetapkan hasil penghasilan sebagai sumber zakat karena terdapatnya illat penyebab yang menurut ulama ulama fikih sah dan nisab yang merupakan landasan wajib zakat
5553361 dan karena islam mempunyai ukuran bagi seseorang untuk bisa dianggap kaya yaitu 12 junaih emas menurut ukuran junaih mesir lama maka ukuran itu harus terpenuhi pula buat seseorang untuk terkena kewajiban zakat sehingga jelas perbedaan antara orang kaya yang wajib zakat dan orang miskin penerima zakat dalam hal ini mazhab hanafi lebih jelas yaitu bahwa jumlah senisab itu cukup terdapat pada awal dan akhir tahun saja tanpa harus terdapat di pertengahan tahun ketentuan itu harus diperhatikan dalam mewajibkan zakat atas hasil penghasilan dan profesi ini supaya dapat jelas siapa yang tergolong kaya dan siapa yang tergolong miskin seorang pekerja profesi jarang tidak memenuhi ketentuan tersebut
5553362 penghasilan dan profesi kita tidak menemukan contohnya dalam fikih selain masalah khusus mengenai penyewaan yang dibicarakan ahmad ia dilaporkan berpendapat tentang seseorang yang menyewakan rumahnya dan mendapatkan uang sewaan yang cukup nisab bahwa orang tersebut wajib mengeluarkan zakatnya ketika menerimanya tanpa persyaratan setahun hal itu pada hakikatnya menyerupai mata penghasilan dan wajib dikeluarkan zakatnya bila sudah mencapai satu nisab
5553363 yaitu kekayaan yang diperoleh seseorang muslim melalui bentuk usaha baru yang sesuai dengan syariat agama

5553429 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5553430 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5553431 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5553432 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5553433 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5553434 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5553435 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5553436 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5553437 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5553438 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5553439 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5553440 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5553441 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5553442 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5553443 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5553444 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

5553473 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5553474 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5553475 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5553476 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5553477 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5553478 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5553479 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5553480 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5553481 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5553482 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5553483 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5553484 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5553485 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5553487 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5553488 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5553489 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5553490 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5553491 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5553492 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5553493 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5553494 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5553495 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5553496 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5553497 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5553498 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5553499 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5553500 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5553501 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5553502 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5553503 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5553504 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5553505 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5553506 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5553507 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

5553509 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5553510 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5553511 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5553512 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5553513 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5553514 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5553515 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5553516 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5553535 in a survey of more than 11 000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the country conducted for the national center on child abuse and neglect researchers found more than 12 000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based on satanic ritual but not one that investigators had been able to substantiate
5553536 one respondent cited as evidence the ritual abuse behavior checklist a dubious diagnostic checklist which includes many behaviors common to childhood gould 1986
5553537 our research leads us to believe that there are many more children being abused in the name of god than in the name of satan
5553538 our survey revealed that there was essentially no hard evidence of organized child abusing satanic cults that had infiltrated preschools or the fbi or that had kidnapped or slain babies in contrast there was much indirect evidence of clinical induction of false memories and plentiful evidence of religion related abuse including sexual abuse by catholic priests although much of my research indicates that children can have largely accurate memories and can resist strong suggestions they can in contrast as indicated by the dramatic examples of ritual abuse claims also tell wild tales cave in to misleading questions and make important errors the same is true of some adults of course all of the books about personal cases of sra were written by adults who seem to have believed their own stories

5553549 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5553550 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5553551 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5553552 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5553553 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5553554 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5553557 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5553558 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5553563 we think that operation sentinel and a lot of the surveillance initiatives that the police are planning are an attack on our right to privacy here in new york
5553564 time to maintain this information to enable us to check and see if any information has surfaced concerning a vehicle coming into the city
5553565 but i would submit this will be a much more advanced system than they have in place

5553567 in an independent survey conducted in may 2008 by probe research inc canadians said they are not choosing bottled water over municipal tap water
5553568 what should be of particular concern to the city of london is that the probe study also indicated that about 60 per cent of bottled water drinkers said they will revert to less healthy alternatives found in plastic beverage containers if bottled water isnt available

5553580 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

5553600 the smokers are out there anyway they might as well be contained in an area
5553601 i think there will be some change to downtown but not a significant change
5553602 i just think our sidewalk space is precious and as much foot traffic as we have i wouldnt like to see it become more congested
5553603 and i think if you are allowing people to drink outside you are going to have some issues
5553604 given the smoking ban this seems like the only fair thing to do for some of these businesses
5553605 came up and seemed to be fairly well recommended plus its near where i live the other thing is that its called a pizza parlor parlour so im not sure what a pizza parlor is exactly but it looks like just a regular old pizza place p pizza
5553606 it was here last year that we turned a corner as a team when we finally got the direction we needed with the porsche this year we have had good direction and now we are pushing very hard to get our performance ready for a back to back set of races that are very different in the type of circuits and the challenges they present we are going to be testing ahead of the mosport race with some new developments that i feel the car has needed in order to give us some adjustability in our setup to remove some of the knife edge conditions that the car has had as we have got nearer to the perfect setup lets hope that the alms gets over their timing problems as it was amazing how much the lack of information upset the early part of the race at road america unfortunately mosport is quite primitive in some of the facilities available im thinking of the media in particular so i hope the teams fans get to read about whats going on when it happens and not sometime after the event
5553607 turns one two and four are blind very fast downhill turns very challenging and dangerous one mistake and you are in the wall this is like the kink in road america but you have the kink three times in one lap at mosport its very cool when you drive trough these turns here you really can feel how much downforce a gt streetcar has that is really amazing
5553608 to prepare myself i went back home to germany to train mentally and physically in daily sports that helps to stay focused and fit during this important and dangerous race dirk is also a very well trained driver that is a key for success
5553609 the car was just perfect in road america tony dowe technical director gave dirk and me a perfectly balanced car that helped at the fast race track in road america and i am a 100 percent sure he will do the same for mosport that will make us quick in the fast downhill turns
5553610 it pushes me even more i am thinking about the championship and racing every single second i am more focused than ever i train hard everyday to give the best of what i can do to dirk tony and tafel racing i am very happy to have such an experienced team behind me
5553611 i am really looking forward to get back to mosport my memories are really good on this track it has always been a lot of fun and i have had a lot of success here there is definitely time to attack but you need to be very cautious not to risk too much the runoffs are hungry and not very comfortable i know from last year that the track suits the ferrari dom was quick there as well so with the ferrari tafel racing the michelin tires and the drivers we are looking forward to a great race
5553612 being in gt2 at mosport nearly every corner is quite challenging the easiest is the hairpin but it is also one of the most important ones
5553613 i am very happy about the competition in our class this pushes everybody on the team to give their best to receive always the maximum we dont need to win every week but we like to be ahead at the end of the year it is so tight right now in points that i believe it will come down to the last race in the last lap
5553614 mosport is known as one of the fastest and most challenging courses in the world it forces you to feel when and where to brake versus having visual cones and markers like most of the other tracks we run it is similar to road america in that you roll through the corners at a higher rate of speed than what you would think they would be turn four the blind left hander is really challenging it takes laps and laps to be able to build the confidence to achieve optimum speed and line to get through turn four at a competitive pace
5553615 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5553616 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5553617 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5553618 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5553619 especially events like this and seeing all these people that came out here to be here for my dad its amazing how theyre still here still behind us
5553620 the guy got out of his car and police told him to freeze
5553621 all of them recognized the threat and all of them fired at the same time so it kind of makes you want to think it was a legitimate threat
5553622 we heard a lot of gunfire then looked out there were sirens everywhere
5553623 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5553624 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5553625 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5553626 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5553627 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5553628 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5553629 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5553630 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5553631 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5553632 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5553633 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5553634 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5553635 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5553636 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5553637 o que eu tenho a perder al m de 6 selos e r 12 00
5553638 she was phoned up and informed this is a massive blow for her
5553639 everyone in task force helmand is affected by the death of a soldier and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family at this most difficult time
5553640 they saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route
5553641 we started looking for some discount prices on the hewlett packard 4350 laser printer and there really wasnt any bargains to be had not many people selling the 4350 for discount price anywhere this didnt exist yet and im sure its because the owners of the 4350 were businesses usually reviews come from private owners who enjoy internet surfing and writing we bought one and its amazing we started our online search at that site didnt sell printers but they did have some helpful links to companies that sold the 4350 we ended up finding the lowest price from one of those companies sorry cant remember the link to the site we bought it from i can tell you this though its an amazing printer period no problems yet and weve had it for 6 months now
5553642 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5553643 regard shall be had to the universal declaration of human rights 1948 to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the federal constitution
5553644 it brought back the memory of sitting in a small apartment staring out the window at one oclock in the morning watching the rain come down
5553645 he sang into his tape recorder i love a rainy night i love a rainy night
5553646 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5553647 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5553648 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5553649 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5553650 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5553651 im trying to do what is best for my family and thats why i left the city
5553652 i believe mechanic lannerd is an incompetent and untrustworthy mechanic who has put the lives of every pilot at risk in this unit with his deceptions and inability to follow faa regulations on the proper maintenance of aircraft in his care
5553653 it is my belief that lt williams had to be aware of robert lannerds poor job performance
5553654 he either chose to look the other way or sanctioned his poor performance hoping that our unit could continue to limp along
5553655 senior corporal marksteiner will embellish stories in order to be heard and make changes
5553656 he does not stop until issues are handled his way
5553657 i was told by the pilots that the screwdriver got away from mr lannerd and shot across the transmission like a speeding bullet
5553658 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5553659 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5553660 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5553661 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5553662 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5553663 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5553664 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5553665 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5553666 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5553667 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5553668 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5553669 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5553670 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5553671 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5553672 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5553673 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5553674 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5553675 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5553676 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5553677 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5553678 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5553679 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5553680 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5553681 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5553682 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5553683 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5553684 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5553685 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5553686 this is a planning took where all things are going
5553687 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5553688 i was afraid it was going to cost him his life
5553689 he wanted to be a police officer since he was little
5553690 he thought he was going to get in there and stop all the crime in chicago
5553691 reassured them that anything we can do will be done to catch the perpetrators
5553692 he was always there on the front lines ready to volunteer
5553693 one day he said i dont care what i gotta do im going
5553694 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5553695 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5553696 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5553697 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5553698 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5553699 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5553700 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5553701 oh good so i can sleep three out of every four nights
5553702 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5553703 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5553704 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5553705 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5553706 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5553707 we dont want people to be educated healthy and confident because they would get out of control
5553708 mom i forgave you a long time ago and the only person you have to worry about forgiving you is yourself
5553709 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
5553710 weird yes tacky absolutely highlight of your trip to nz maybe not
5553711 lonely planet seems to think that stonehenge aotearoa is an imitation of stonehenge in britain but this is completely wrong
5553712 ive been to both it and the original stonehenge in britain and theres no contest stonehenge aotearoa is by far the most interesting experience said ms varnham
5553713 the demand is quite dull as price are going up it will remain like this if price wont come down
5553714 do i get your account and password as you say you have tested this game
5553715 we love our vacuum weve found god and we gave at the office
5553716 hes a 45 mile per hour couch potato a large cat
5553717 everyone expects him to be real hyper but he is very laid back and naps a lot
5553718 he carries his blanket around and cuddles up with it i can just lie right on top of him and he doesnt mind hes just really loving and social
5553719 youre up the minute the sun starts baking the van its pretty miserable
5553720 by comparison a hard tour back then sounds like gravy now
5553721 economically and from all angles its a perfect storm for bands
5553722 you see a lot of musicians going back to get their real estate licenses
5553723 the bulk of every dollar we make on performance fees and merchandise is going in the gas tank at some point or another whether it be the current tour or the next one
5553724 so theres not money left over to invest in merchandise or to invest in a new market in brazil or going to do the european tour or japan
5553725 bars are probably giving out a lot more sympathy pizzas and sympathy baskets of wings for not being able to pay bands what theyre worth
5553726 you can get rid of a lot of weekend warriors this way
5553727 el mundo competitivo de hoy exige personas flexibles que tomen riesgos y que rompan esquemas estas personas ser n las creadoras de los cambios en la industria
5553728 nuestro personal est en primer lugar despu s los clientes y luego los accionistas puede sonar raro pero no podemos superar las expectativas de nuestros clientes a no ser que excedamos las de nuestro personal primero nuestra nica ventaja competitiva sustentable es la calidad de nuestros trabajadores
5553729 porque la forma como la gerencia trate a sus asociados es exactamente igual a la forma como ellos tratar n a los clientes
5553730 siempre hay que tratar a nuestros empleados exactamente como queremos que ellos traten a nuestros mejores clientes
5553731 toda filosof a actitud y pr ctica empresarial usada por la alta gerencia para tratar a sus empleados ser n recicladas por los empleado hacia los clientes de la compa a
5553732 preoc pense por los empleados y ellos se preocupar n por los clientes
5553733 creemos que la gente muchas veces entiende las cosas al rev s quiere ganar m s dinero incrementar las utilidades y concentran su atenci n en las cifras financieras en vez de hacerlo en las personas que son clientes y en las personas que atienden a los clientes es decir el personal la mejor definici n de ganancia que hemos escuchado es ganancia es el aplauso que se obtiene de atender bien a sus clientes y crear un entorno de motivaci n para su personal ah est la triple esencia
5553734 un grupo importante de investigadores est sacando a la luz evidencia de algo que los defensores de la calidad del clima laboral saben desde hace d cadas que las personas que ejecutan objetivos de negocio son m s que ovejas de un reba o motivarlos puede tener resultados casi m gicos en los estados financieros de las empresas

5553737 should i get back together with my ex after my break up
5553738 how to stop break up when my ex does not seem to be responding how to stop break up when everyone around me doesnt seems to be supportive
5553739 there comes no lovely day in spring when the doors of americas businesses fly open and employees rush away singing office is out office is out management let the monkeys out no more faxes no more phones no more taking laptops home
5553740 see thousands of cover letters and resumes every month some of them desperately need to be shared
5553741 dedicated to all those who wonder why no one has called to set up an interview
5553742 even though jane left you can do the work without another headcount im transferring your headcount over to heidis department
5553743 ummm i may be losing the headcount but lets interview anyway
5553744 this story relates to an interview for a junior sales post
5553745 the candidates first mistake was to turn up in a white suit
5553746 the candidate started to mumble and said he couldnt answer the questions
5553747 when asked why this was he said that his girlfriend had written his cv for him
5553748 he continued to give mumbled responses when asked whether he was nervous he replied that hed only just got out of bed and hadnt had any breakfast
5553749 why does it seem as if most of the decisions in my workplace are made by drunken lemurs
5553750 decisions are made by people who have time not people who have talent
5553751 theyre fixing the problems made by people who have time
5553752 our surveillance cameras caught you posting this anti management comic on the wall
5553753 you wont be eligible for unemployment benefits unless you can prove you were stupid as opposed to malicious
5553754 the company will be fine without my secret and exclusive knowledge of critical systems
5553755 would you say you worship satan or do you simply respect his no nonsense approach to discipline
5553756 he was a shining example of the best in american policing
5553757 this man was with us every single time and made the decision to send his friends his sons his team in to protect the citizens of this county
5553758 and he was very good at it he never wavered in his role as our commander but he never wavered in his role as our friend either
5553759 we all knew the palczynski story was going to end badly based on what had already happened
5553760 one of the memories that stays with me is that lieutenant howe was a fellow who prior to beginning an investigation would say a small prayer
5553761 it was the swat guy next to me who was able to return fire and save my life
5553762 youre in there with some of the toughest well trained guys in the agency and theres not a dry eye in the place
5553763 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5553764 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5553765 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5553766 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5553767 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5553768 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5553769 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5553770 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5553771 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5553772 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5553773 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5553774 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5553775 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5553776 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5553777 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5553778 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5553779 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5553780 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5553781 please dont fail me wooden board you are my only friend
5553782 if you spend enough time here youll be the zebra eventually
5553783 my first assignment for finals in drama class was shakespeare and the teacher said i couldnt do it because a latino wouldnt do it well i remember practicing with a little tape recorder and he ended up giving me an a he said that i was good but that i should go to mexico to do soaps because as an actor i wouldnt make it in the u s
5553784 the teacher said to me that i had an accent and i tried to get rid of it but later i realized my accent is me and its not gonna change he had his favorites in class and i speculate i wasnt one
5553785 something in me said wow thats what i want to do
5553786 i was rushed and i decided to do graphic design until i was ready to do an audition thinking to myself oh my god what am i doing and i told people
5553787 they said youre crazy and i became a corporate investigator and did that for 10 years instead
5553788 i ended up getting the job in san francisco and it wasnt until a couple of months later that i stumbled into an advertising for an audition
5553789 in the spring of 2003 i got a tv show and it was the same year i flew to ny to resign as an investigator my boss was crazy over it and he even said sleep it off and come back tomorrow i slept it off and the next day i came in and had my resignation signed off
5553790 when i was working i got a call from him saying hed drive me to an audition so along the way certain people have stood out to make things happen
5553791 good guy one time and a bad guy the next
5553792 even though i feel like i made it it has to be like i havent made it yet my goal is to be a part of a big blockbuster or a cast that gives me a daily job and make me say yeah i made it many actors complain that theres no jobs and ive just been blessed to have a job since i moved here so you have to make a decision and sacrifice it all to make it happen
5553793 every actor has to do three scripts a day and you only have one take so its a lot of work it made me a better actor and hats off to everyone who works on soaps everyday
5553794 as actors we have to be balanced and understanding and sometimes its just waiting like going to the amusement park why stop in a line that takes two hours because theres an amazing ride at the end and thats exactly acting you wait to get to the front of the line to get the ride of your life
5553795 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5553796 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5553797 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off

5553805 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary
5553806 of course i start to breathe after somebody passed gas

5553818 ill be away from my desk invoking a john maneuver

5553825 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler

5553836 more liquid in your system makes the boogers come out faster
5553837 its like my car was trying to do a yoga pose my car was doing a headstand in a ditch
5553838 the first step is admitting you have a problem the first step is admitting im a stupid haole
5553839 im wondering how lucrative my five star hotel will be on mount doom
5553840 actually what i was thinking was i wish tina crouse was a couple years older

5553879 i had someone ask me in class in front of a whole bunch of people why i wasnt married
5553880 let me rephrase that a woman with a big ol fro not a big ol woman with a fro
5553881 lets talk about you sweating in the shape of a heart i think thats romantic
5553882 were sharing lunch now and this is after your sweaty romantic activity

5553924 i hope you sit next to a big fat person on the airplane
5553925 you know one day youre actually going to kill me and ill be laughing in heaven as they throw your butt in jail
5553926 i couldnt have stood out more if i was riding a brontosaurus through there
5553927 rat has a goosebite rat has a goosebite rat has a goosebite
5553928 are you pouring some kind of cleaner on the floor where he farted
5553929 it hurt i begged him to stop i cried afterwards
5553930 he speaks and it is as if a writer or poet is speaking to us sentence fragments and all
5553931 me not saying something and you not writing it down are two completely different things
5553932 the entire night i just wanted to jump on those lips
5553933 barring a lighting strike at the lottery we call new student orientation
5553934 do you know why im taking his class one of these days hes going to die teaching and i want to be there for it
5553935 i feel like the loose jenga block that is easy to pull out

5553938 oh uncle johnny i didnt know you could look so handsome

5553941 you remind me of my friend deanna shes a female bodybuilder
5553942 i was taking down the donkey from the nativity scene in our kitchen and i thought to myself if i drop the donkey on the floor and it breaks then i can tell people that i broke my ass on the kitchen floor
5553943 you see the difference between me and you is my mouth gets me into trouble and yours gets you out of it
5553944 the geisha sleep in certain positions so as not to disturb their elaborate hairdos and thats what i was just doing
5553945 i dont want to be tied down and have my time consumed by someone there to say i love you to and having to hold hands and shop together and eat with and no one to hold and cuddle with i can play xbox all night long baby
5553946 finally i got up and read my bible i figured that would put me to sleep
5553947 no i dont have a jackhammer or an 18 wheeler but i bet john moody does or at least john moody knows someone who does
5553948 were portuguese so were kinda hairy but this guy was like a bear i had to check the filters after he got out of the pool and he was big
5553949 noses and ears never stop growing youre in for a treat pablo
5553950 and who brought taryn walker to boyce college thats right the holy spirit
5553951 whenever i want to find you on facebook i just do a search and type in butt and you come up
5553952 i told kris i felt like a banana in a bowl of milk
5553953 i promise i really did check him out before i started dating him
5553954 so i was typing to you and there was dead silence on the phone and forgot i was on the phone with my mom and she randomly started talking and it startled me
5553955 whos the one whose name begins with a j and ends with an n
5553956 go shopping with him and youll never be satisfied with another mans shopping again
5553957 do you guys have a money changer in the temple
5553958 its like the military here i have to say yes sir to my roommate
5553959 i cant believe you said makeout in front of my mom

5553963 im a samaritan shun me just meet me at the well at 3 oclock
5553964 this is the first time shes been publicly traded on the girl exchange and her stock has gone sky high
5553965 this isnt fair prybys only got on your wall of quotes because pretty much anything that proceeds from her mouth is notably retarded
5553966 youre just upset because you cant put that on facebook
5553967 theres a stomach virus going around and every girl on my hall has been inflicted with the terror
5553968 youre like a reality t v show i want to turn the channel and walk away but for some strange reason i cant
5553969 i own too many nice ties not to go to the spring banquet
5553970 god blessed me with great hair im counting on that to bring me true love
5553971 this song was written for my future wife which is none of you
5553972 i hope i dont get married til im in grad school so i can pick up undergrad chicks too
5553973 i have a new vein on my leg i feel like an old woman one of those blue nasty ones
5553974 may it not be said of me methinks she doth protest too much because really im just raising a voice for all of us you choose to mercilessly poke numerous times throughout the day
5553975 cause all my good looking genes cant override someone whos ugly
5553976 i lost it from all the throwing up i did
5553977 you know if you keep breathing like that when i talk to you about girls youre never going to get married
5553978 i dont sleep with him any more john hes older than me hes older than you
5553979 i cant explain the honor of having two quotes on your profile it gives one the sense that they are going to be somebody wow
5553980 can i suck some of your blood so that i can be a pirate
5553981 if i was bored and had a lot of spare time i would count how many pictures of lauren duncan i had on my computer
5553982 i dont feel comfortable with you saying that and wearing those shorts
5553983 hey lance was telling me about this job at the hospital they charge you nine dollars an hour
5553984 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
5553985 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
5553986 ms tomsic and the calvo family were innocent victims of drug traffickers
5553987 reports of similar misconduct including service of warrants at the wrong address excessive use of no knock entries and other unjustified killings of family pets this has happened before and without oversight it will happen again
5553988 what saddens us most is that all too often these injustices go unnoticed by law enforcement officials and those who are victimized are forced to suffer in silence
5553989 sure you might have tons of them in the cabinet and yes you might use them all at one time or another but there is always that one that you prefer
5553990 i knew i was going to drink beer so i wouldnt care what people were thinking
5553991 people gave me looks joked around a little asked why i was wearing a skirt
5553992 its pretty cool that my dad fights for what he thinks he should do my buddies have no problem with it
5553993 dont confine the legs or cramp the male genitals the way that trousers or shorts do
5553994 what weve created is an integrated story that runs across all the platforms
5553995 its right up there with putting my jacket in the smithsonian institution
5553996 he winkler used the show as a platform to teach morals and values and yet he was still cool
5553997 that statue is well deserved because 50 to 100 years from now that character will still be cool
5553998 they think maybe i just changed stations or time slots or something
5553999 thats really all im doing right now im really proud of it
5554000 this is a much bigger and better way to give back
5554001 its far from easy it felt like i went through a 10 round fight with muhammad ali and i wasnt the winner but its worth it in the end
5554002 ive worked with many physical therapists and these guys are different
5554003 broccoli is great but its not the only vegetable its good to add variety to every food category because youll add a broader mix of nutrients
5554004 it tastes great its healthy and its an ecologically good choice
5554005 what stuck out to me was how high arctic char is in omega 3 fatty acids i like salmon and trout and when i read that it was a cross between the two it really caught my attention
5554006 its great to recommend to people who prefer not to eat strong tasting fish but want omega 3s
5554007 his gallbladder had ruptured and gangrene had formed in his stomach he was 80 plus and the doctors said his constitution wouldnt be able to take the strain of an operation but there was no choice he had to be operated on
5554008 he was all right during surgery but soon complications developed he couldnt breathe and he had a massive heart attack that killed him
5554009 he was really miserable in his illness he couldnt talk and he couldnt make his discomfort apparent to us so there was a complete lack of communication
5554010 the blood gushed out and was all over my face it took a while for everyone to realise i was injured
5554011 fortunately the cut is hidden by my hair so no continuity problems
5554012 working with a living legend like subhash ghai in yuvraj is such a privilege its a tearjerker a drama about relationships its the quintessential bollywood film and my other forthcoming film blue is just the opposite experience its a get happy adventure sporty film
5554013 im also doing a romantic comedy with vashu bhagnani i havent done one of those i was dying to do it
5554014 im aware of my dads track record but im not just looking to equal his track record im hoping to better it
5554015 but seriously today the box office has changed so much things were different in my dads times the relationships within the industry and definitions of success have changed today you cant walk on the road without a camera following you you either love it or you dont but im not scared of the future ill keep trying until i succeed
5554016 am i thats surprising anyway let the others have fun im happy being devoted to malaika
5554017 aqeel is not my brother in law hes my brother
5554018 please wait a minute just hold on a second here i want to think about this i would like to talk to you before i go
5554019 what is going on here please light clarify yourself for me i really want to know the reality of the situation
5554020 oh god i did not know how beautiful we are
5554021 remember this and never forget you save redeem and heal yourself you always have you always will you were created with the power to do so from before the beginning of the world
5554022 oh dear god dear universe dear great self i love my life
5554023 this is the river of life drink of this manna water to your hearts content
5554024 what is the best religion on the planet which one is right
5554025 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5554026 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5554027 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5554028 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5554029 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5554030 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5554031 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5554032 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5554033 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5554034 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5554035 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5554036 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5554037 hello mate im currently studying so and so and looking to talk to someone
5554038 im just walking around agencies trying to get a job
5554039 yeah um hi this is bob i went to penn law if you want to hire me you can call me at xxx xxx xxxx
5554040 nos r sultats montrent que les employes fran ais obtiennent en moyenne 37 jours de vacances repartis sur sept voyages en 2008 contre 14 pour un americain qui ne les prendra meme pas tous estime de roux
5554041 cela signifie que le touriste fran ais fait plus troitement attention a son budget sur plus de voyages tandis que lamericain depense librement pour un ou deux conges annuels
5554042 quand ils partent a letranger les voyageurs fran ais demande la meme qualite que ce quils ont a la maison dit de roux les americains par contre demande le meme service exceptionnel auquel ils sont habitues a la maison raison pour laquelle ils arrivent en tete au rang des plus bruyants plus enclins a se plaindre et parmi les moins polis
5554043 the whole idea is to promote hindi in europe if hindi dies among second generation indians from north india in europe their links with india will also die as language is a crucial aspect of culture so we thought that inculcating love of the language was important for inculcating the love of india
5554044 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
5554045 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5554046 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5554047 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5554048 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5554049 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5554050 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5554051 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5554052 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5554053 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5554054 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5554055 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5554056 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5554057 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5554058 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5554059 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5554060 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5554061 art is often utilized as a form of propaganda and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood
5554062 no one seems to know where the mysterious stickers came from colorful dots that appeared in this eastern wisconsin town apparently placing a value on the most mundane of public objects
5554063 shall the city of mequon purchase the we energies water utility for 14 4 million subject to the following a no city property tax revenues shall be used to purchase operate or improve the utility b currently existing homes and other buildings that are not connected to the utility shall never be required to connect to the utility and c no homeowner or other building owner or tenant shall be required to pay anything to the utility for their building at any time the building is not physically connected to the utility
5554064 i see that the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed
5554065 mommy mommy the moon is on top of the mountains
5554066 the actress is devastated her biological clock is ticking and she was hoping to marry john before her 40th birthday next year
5554067 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment
5554068 back in the 70s there were a lot of dinner parties then in the 80s and 90s people moved away from that into restaurants
5554069 people are walking away from restaurants because it does bite its expensive and people can have just as good a quality meal and do it at home for a much more affordable price
5554070 a lot of people will say im doing a casserole give me a piece of rump and well tell them that if they want something good dont buy the expensive cut of rump buy the cheaper cut of chuck steak for the long slow cooking
5554071 the cheaper cuts are the more flavoursome just treat them the right way and theyll come out beautifully
5554072 i can set them up with a really nice cheese platter a brie from france or a sheeps milk cheese from spain with all the condiments the maggie beer quince paste and the medjool dates from california
5554073 these are the things that the fine dining restaurants are using and theyre available to the consumer now they can get it locally and affordably have their friends around do it at their own pace and it does save them money
5554074 when people are entertaining at home they really want to be able to say through what they have bought look how much i like you ive got you this cheese from spain you know what i mean
5554075 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5554076 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5554077 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5554078 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5554079 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5554080 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5554081 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5554082 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5554083 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5554084 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5554085 at first i thought it would be nice to have a few paintings on indian temples in kuala lumpur

5554113 i would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only
5554114 the awareness of intelligence vulnerabilities in private industry and in protecting government secrets
5554115 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5554116 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5554117 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5554118 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5554119 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5554120 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5554121 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5554122 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5554123 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5554124 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5554125 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5554126 i will marry next year and want to have a baby soon after
5554127 i think salman said whatever he wanted to say let people make of it whatever they want i have never commented on the personal side in the media i dont wish to start right now
5554128 letzten november hatte ich im internet entdeckt dass eine gruppe der siedler touren ins westjordanland anbot deren absicht ist es israelis zu werben die h user in den siedlungen kaufen und ausl ndische j dische touristen sollen dort auch investieren das hat mich ge rgert und dann dachte ich was die k nnen kann ich auch
5554129 das ist der schrecklichste abschnitt der mauer den ich ihnen heute zeigen kann stellen sie sich vor sie wachen fr h auf und entlang der hauptstra e ihres wohnviertels verl uft pl tzlich eine acht meter hohe mauer
5554130 ich will karriere in der politik machen im ffentlichen dienst deshalb muss ich mir mein eigenes bild machen um zu verstehen was hier passiert nicht nur vom h rensagen
5554131 freunde von uns haben die tour gemacht sie haben gesagt es wird sehr deprimierend
5554132 was jetzt kommt ist verr ckt wir fahren durch einen checkpoint der jerusalem und das westjordanland verbindet wenn wir wieder in die stadt zur ckkehren m ssten wir eigentlich scharf kontrolliert werden
5554133 was wir erlebt haben ist die ausnahme von der regel die frau hat tats chlich ihren job gemacht gefragt wo wir herkommen hat ins auto geschaut aber die meisten autos kommen ohne kontrolle durch wenn sie gelbe israelische nummerschilder haben wie wir das stellt die gesamte idee dieser extrem teuren sperranlage die uns vom westjordanland trennen und vor terror sch tzen soll in frage die anlage wird zum witz
5554134 daraus ergeben sich so viele fragen zum beispiel wie m ssen verschiedene kulturen lernen miteinander klar zu kommen es ist etwas entmutigend
5554135 ich verstehe nicht warum es nicht mehr opposition gibt vor allem wenn man sich an das j dische konzept von gerechtigkeit h lt dass auf joshua zur ckgeht vielleicht bin ich ja wirklich naiv aber ich verstehe es nicht in den vereinigten staaten sind viele linke juden und viele kriegsgegner schon w hrend des vietnamkriegs waren juden ich verstehe nicht warum diese einstellung hier nie angekommen ist
5554136 schauen sie auf das graffiti an der mauer wo die mutter mit dem kind l uft vom warschauer ghetto zum abu dis ghetto mich durchf hrt jedes mal ein schauer wenn ich das sehe
5554137 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5554138 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5554139 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5554140 theres nobody down there in dire straits because they dont have any food or water right now
5554141 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5554142 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5554143 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5554144 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5554145 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5554146 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5554147 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5554148 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5554149 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5554150 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5554151 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5554152 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5554153 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5554154 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5554155 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5554156 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5554157 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5554158 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about being our linebacker
5554159 it is kind of frustrating wondering who the starting quarterback is
5554160 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5554161 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5554162 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5554163 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5554164 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5554165 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5554166 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5554167 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5554168 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5554169 you might have a family thats having a hard time and it might take another day and thats ok
5554170 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5554171 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5554172 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5554177 teach an old indicator new tricks or the commodity channel index not for commodities only
5554178 from your comment about economic conditions and the outlook you obviously believe stock prices are high why dont you sell stocks with the idea of repurchasing at lower prices the businessman also should be aware of a problem confronting open end investment company managements
5554179 our goal is clearly not to find a qualified and interested us worker and you know in a sense that sounds funny but its what were trying to do here
5554180 we dont have an incentive for people to stay poor not zero sum their gains as they move up do not come at our expense china fear that they will catch up so we will fall behind untrue china has improved its standard of living is by selling us stuff they can make more cheaply than we can which is good for both of us chinas success increases our success improves our lives

5554188 we are disappointed but we understand celgenes decision given their recent withdrawal of the marketing authorization application for satraplatin in europe we plan to decide in the near future the next steps regarding the development of satraplatin and we will continue to focus our other efforts on advancing our rgb 286638 kinase inhibitor into the clinic and exploring various merger and acquisition opportunities
5554189 doctors clearly are not convinced that the new revalidation process will provide the benefits the government is citing
5554190 less than half agree that revalidation will enhance public confidence in the medical profession or ensure physicians keep more up to date
5554191 in addition the vast majority 84 do not feel that the new procedures will be successful in identifying another harold shipman the gp who murdered more than 200 people over 23 years as one of our respondents said harold shipman would have passed all of the validation requirements there is no system which will detect this type of aberrant behavior that view was echoed by most of the gps in our survey who pointed out that shipman was well liked and competent and that no revalidation system would expose a psychopath
5554192 overall only about half of gps see any good in the revalidation process and even fewer just 28 think it is long overdue
5554193 one of our respondents summed up what seems to be the predominant feeling calling the new process a shallow political gesture with no cost benefit evidence to support it another called it another costly exercise based on an unsound premise that pulls yet more time away from our patients still others spoke about potentially resigning or moving overseas clearly physicians have grave doubts about the new procedure and its potential effects
5554194 publicis groupe has been a leader in the advertising industry for decades and we believe performics growing business will benefit from being a part of it
5554195 we look forward to working with performics as a partner
5554196 we argue that the prwora actively constructs male fatherhood not only through state policies that maintain male
5554197 this literature includes both qualitative and quantitative studies that address questions of economic feasibility payment barriers and socioeconomic outcomes each of the individual studies is subject to common limitations including small sample sizes self report biases and limited generalizability due to the geographic concentration of samples

5554203 it would help us endure what we had to endure but we knew god wasnt going to come down and wave a magic wand
5554204 i established a free fire zone and shot any man woman or child who stepped into it
5554205 sure i remember a story someone told me 37 years ago
5554206 the phenomenon of thousands of people moving together in huge blocks like a machine operated by one person to serve one purpose is a phenomenon that history has proven to be associated with regimes we would rather forget ever existed
5554207 opposite the giant stages speer positioned huge blocks of people dressed in brown and black uniforms who together formed an impressive geometric shape the spirit of the generation which was disturbed by the anarchy and disorder couldnt but watch the scene in great awe
5554208 the visitors in nuremberg including many foreigners were so impressed they were ready to disregard the repulsive aspects of the regime
5554209 if this was about a small country like andorra then that wouldnt have been a reason for concern but this is china a country that accounts for a fifth of the worlds population and has enormous power and natural resources it has the ability to bring into action the ideas that lie behind those ceremonies ideas of imperialism intervention and oppression
5554210 speaking of disciples how many of you consider yourselves to be disciples of jesus christ
5554211 im so glad you answered that way because im going to give you all a chance to put your faith into action
5554212 what i have here is a child packet from compassion international and we have a lot more on our tables in the back
5554213 you know jesus taught us that we are to care for the poor the needy the oppressed the very least among us and in any given society the children are always the very least and always the ones who suffer most but this is your chance to change that you can sponsor a child
5554214 for 32 a month you can help to meet the needs of a child and give them opportunities that they could never imagine otherwise go back and look at the child packets we have whether you go now before emery comes on or after doesnt matter just go look into the eyes of these little ones and see their need
5554215 this is your chance to truly help the poor and the needy this is your chance to show that you really are a disciple to your master 32 a month really isnt a lot when you consider the way youre going to change the world for one child and it will change the world for you by knowing that youve done your part to help
5554216 i heard somebody talking about it but i didnt know it was you that was great you really did good

5554221 massachusetts had a number of advantages when it enacted its property tax cap
5554222 new york is having a fiscal crisis it is not enacting a cap at a time when the economy is booming and there is a lot of money in the state coffers
5554223 they are laying off teachers getting rid of sports programs making parents drive their kids
5554224 we could fight over tax caps or we could fight over circuit breakers ultimately it is the state that has control over spending
5554225 what the senate and assemblyman need to do is sit down and say is we need real reform people are losing their homes people cant pay for their health insurance
5554226 art is often utilized as a form of propaganda and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood

5554366 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5554367 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5554368 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5554369 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5554370 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5554371 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5554372 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5554373 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5554374 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage
5554375 as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation but the people of arizona and of all america expect more from their representatives than that and instead i sought a better bill im proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families and better serves the interests of our country
5554376 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5554377 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5554378 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5554379 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5554380 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed

5554445 the boomers think if this is the face of retirement im okay with it
5554446 its a cross between a five star hotel and a cruise ship
5554447 but we really dont know what that generations going to look like in very old age
5554448 some people in the baby boom generation will end up with high levels of health problems or dementias and some of them will not
5554449 we need to change the mindset that got us into iraq
5554450 i am running because of what dr king called the fierce urgency of now i am running because i do believe theres such a thing as being too late

5554455 many instruments are provided in solo and ensemble variants and multiple articulations each instrument is available in a high fidelity version for studio production and a lower fidelity configuration for decreased overhead and instant performance
5554456 unfortunately for me that guy was a freak a terminator
5554457 i do want to play in the nfl hopefully one day and i know i need numbers
5554458 im really behind rey and cush and i have to play catch up
5554459 the touch panel is obviously a very new thing to have in a restaurant so we were worried customers would complain about it being too technological but so far no one has had any problems at all
5554460 they jump in straight away and are clicking like crazy ordering away i think because computers and the internet are so popular these days this sort of technology in restaurants is really just the next step
5554461 you can do the entrees your brother can do hot pots mum can take care of drinks and im doing the rest because im paying

5554464 if you knew you were taking a turn you could pause the video and line it up its as simple as that
5554465 we are disappointed but we understand celgenes decision given their recent withdrawal of the marketing authorization application for satraplatin in europe we plan to decide in the near future the next steps regarding the development of satraplatin and we will continue to focus our other efforts on advancing our rgb 286638 kinase inhibitor into the clinic and exploring various merger and acquisition opportunities
5554466 todays announcement represents an innovative approach to the r amp d productivity challenges our pharmaceutical clients are facing
5554467 we are very excited to welcome world class lilly scientific talent to covance and to take possession of valuable state of the art assets including more than 600 000 square feet of laboratory space and acquire new service lines that will help us accelerate our long term strategic growth plans covance will invest in this facility and maximize its capacity utilization by conducting substantial work with lilly and bring in new work from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients we expect the greenfield site to be a key contributor to the future growth and success of covance
5554468 this strategic agreement is a result of a long term trust based relationship between our two companies covance has proven they can help accelerate drug development timelines and improve efficiencies with lilly which will enable us to further focus on our core competencies in delivering better patient outcomes over the longer term
5554469 this industry pioneering alliance will provide lilly access to covances broad and efficient drug development platforms in addition this collaboration will help us make our fixed cost infrastructure more flexible and continue to grow our portfolio of best in class and first in class pharmaceutical products
5554470 doctors clearly are not convinced that the new revalidation process will provide the benefits the government is citing
5554471 less than half agree that revalidation will enhance public confidence in the medical profession or ensure physicians keep more up to date
5554472 in addition the vast majority 84 do not feel that the new procedures will be successful in identifying another harold shipman the gp who murdered more than 200 people over 23 years as one of our respondents said harold shipman would have passed all of the validation requirements there is no system which will detect this type of aberrant behavior that view was echoed by most of the gps in our survey who pointed out that shipman was well liked and competent and that no revalidation system would expose a psychopath
5554473 overall only about half of gps see any good in the revalidation process and even fewer just 28 think it is long overdue
5554474 one of our respondents summed up what seems to be the predominant feeling calling the new process a shallow political gesture with no cost benefit evidence to support it another called it another costly exercise based on an unsound premise that pulls yet more time away from our patients still others spoke about potentially resigning or moving overseas clearly physicians have grave doubts about the new procedure and its potential effects
5554475 i knew that if there was a rotorcraft that could help me break some records it would be the grand
5554476 russia was probably the most stressful part of the trip
5554477 if i had to pick the biggest challenge that would probably be it
5554478 publicis groupe has been a leader in the advertising industry for decades and we believe performics growing business will benefit from being a part of it
5554479 we look forward to working with performics as a partner
5554480 after checking with both team and local hospital officials we figured he should no longer fight because it could threaten his life
5554481 baik wanted to fight but we stopped him from doing so
5554482 as a friendly neighbor china sincerely hopes pakistan will maintain political stability and achieve economic development
5554483 played an important role in developing china pakistan ties and we evaluate this in a positive manner
5554484 markets are continuing to pay close attention to these issues and one focus is naturally on how things are going to develop from here
5554485 reaction is limited compared to the times when market attention was only on the financial turmoil
5554486 what were seeing is a complete change in consumer patterns
5554487 yeah hes the guy who played so and so in such and such a movie
5554488 i am really pleased to know that the education i am paying for is actually not all for naught
5554489 huh i didnt learn about that in school we dont learn anything about california
5554490 i saw that on the simpsons but on the show he was president
5554491 i knew he was really just governor tho cuz later i heard about that on the news
5554492 whoa let me get this product for my wife girlfriend so she can look better for me
5554493 united voluntary services is a national organization committed to recruiting volunteers and raising funds to help meet the needs of hospitalized veterans in veterans affairs medical centers
5554494 we have 43 units in 20 va medical centers with over 600 volunteers conducting varied programs for veterans that the hospitals do not and cannot financially afford
5554495 we have a large contingent of young people who volunteer for us in the summer
5554496 secretary gates has said on any number of occasions that the war against extremism is the war that we are fighting now and that whatever else we plan for and whatever else we do we need to succeed in the war that were fighting now
5554497 we are still in the process of building up that capacity that institutional capacity within the department its a process that began with the 2006 quadrennial defense review weve clearly made progress but were not there
5554498 one of the things that the strategy talks about is the need for an expanded conception of what jointness is all about
5554499 what we need to face many of the challenges that we see now and are likely to see in the future is a jointness that encompasses not only the armed services but civilian capabilities within the defense department other departments and agencies and our friends and allies
5554500 integration of all the elements of national power and being able to bring them to bear on the security challenges we face
5554501 its one of the reasons why secretary gates has been such a vocal proponent of greater funding for you know the non instruments of national security if you will particularly the state department u s agency for international development and others
5554502 what secretary gates said in releasing the strategy is really important which is its all about balance
5554503 if you look at what the services fund in terms of programs in terms of training and education and when it comes to traditional warfare its substantial
5554504 so you think all of this is just going to go away if obama gets in
5554505 he just played the card he has been dealt and doesnt see that hes special
5554506 we knew from the outset that the eastlink was a roadway that had the potential for high speeds
5554507 tunnels present particular environmental issues when a collision occurs and we know what the devastating impact of these crashes can be
5554508 speed cameras form an integral part of the overall road safety strategy adopted by victoria police and we will continue to couple them with other enforcement and road safety initiatives
5554509 last year 172 fatalities or 52 per cent of the road toll occurred on 100km h roads which represents an overall increase of seven per cent from 2006
5554510 deaths on metropolitan melbourne roads with speed limits of 100km h increased by 38 per cent in 2007 which is even more concerning
5554511 these are not just mere figures they represent families and communities who will never see their loved ones again
5554512 we know drivers instinctively slow down when they see a speed camera and this reaction can save lives so hopefully this will make motorists think twice and the eastlink remains fatality free for as long as possible
5554513 it would put the world bank in a political hot spot with the white house
5554514 menos mal que a vara era da fabiana imagine se fosse da shana
5554515 seus pais est o ao vivo de sua casa fale com eles sobre esse momento
5554516 you wouldnt expect 45 nm to be running hotter and you wouldnt expect it to be running slower and you wouldnt expect it to be more expensive
5554517 so if you look at 65 nm compared to 45 nm there is a definitive opportunity for improvements in performance power and price
5554518 it will hit once the price of ddr3 comes down
5554519 the back half of next year 2009 is about the time the process changes in ddr3 will happen that will allow the prices to come down

5554521 yes you should totally get a new car youd look fabulous in that car you deserve it
5554522 you know your car insurance is going to go up i dont think that model gets very good mileage make sure you think about all the costs involved
5554523 in my country we go to prison first and then become president
5554524 whatever the sentence your worship sees fit to impose upon me for the crime for which i have been convicted before this court may it rest assured that when my sentence has been completed i will still be moved as men are always moved by their conscience i will still be moved by my dislike of the race discrimination against my people when i come out from serving my sentence i will take up again as best i can the struggle for the removal of those injustices until they are finally abolished
5554525 the time comes in the life of any nation when there remains only two choices submit or fight that time has now come to south africa we shall not submit and we have no choice but to hit back by all means in our power in defense of our people our future and our freedom
5554526 only free men can negotiate prisoners cannot enter into contracts
5554527 for to be free is not merely to cast off ones chains but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others
5554528 as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
5554529 during my lifetime i have dedicated myself to this struggle of the people i have fought against white domination and i have fought against black domination i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony with equal opportunities it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to see realized but if needs be it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die
5554530 i greet you all in the name of peace democracy and freedom for all i stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you the people your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today i therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands
5554531 i detest racialism because i regard it as a barbaric thing whether it comes from a black man or a white man
5554532 education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world
5554533 no one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion people must learn to hate and if they can learn to hate they can be taught to love for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite
5554534 never never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another
5554535 and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same
5554536 i always remember the axiom a leader is like a shepherd he stays behind the flock letting the most nimble go out ahead whereupon the others follow not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind
5554537 there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires
5554538 we must use time wisely and forever realize that the time is always ripe to do right
5554539 back in november we made some sdk builds available that we referred to as
5554540 were giving people an education on the ground since this isnt a community of early adopters but we know theyre eager to learn

5554544 a way to keep content and the ad very pure users are very interested in the ad content itself
5554545 the way users interact in video search is more of a search and browse mentality whereas in regular search it is more of a search and refine mentality
5554546 its the text search engine that brings visitors to the site and then how they merchandise the content on the site determines which content wins and which content loses
5554547 the asaish are saying they will annex kirkuk by force and that is terrifying people
5554548 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk
5554549 it was a clarifying moment it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5554550 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5554551 our troops have performed magnificently and violence is genuinely down
5554552 but listen if you drive a bus into a ditch and then after five years and a trillion dollars and 4 000 lives lost you are getting the bus halfway out of the ditch it doesnt mean you made a good decision driving the bus off the road in the first place
5554553 i know democrats have not been that successful in presidential elections over the last few cycles
5554554 and so everywhere i go people tell me oh im getting nervous republicans are so mean theyre going to swift boat you theyre going to be doing things to you what are we going to do
5554555 and i have to just remind people that it is true that just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics the same guys who brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain they cant win an argument on ideas so theyre going to do is try to attack me
5554556 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5554557 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5554558 the ioc seems oblivious to the fact that theyre holding the games in a repressive environment
5554559 with the olympics here now is the best time to remind the world that china still has problems that need to be solved
5554560 but like my dad said at the end of the day i have the most important medal
5554561 thats the most important thing if it happened in the all around i would have been much more upset
5554562 i am so happy that i can bring happiness to the people of my country
5554563 if i wasnt able to do this i wouldnt have been able to live with myself
5554564 i dont know exactly how i won i guess it is a special rule for judges
5554565 when two people arrive at the same level why not make them both champions
5554566 i believe its correct to have two gold medals but this is my modest opinion
5554567 its a human being judging i guess thats what it comes down to
5554568 youre up the minute the sun starts baking the van its pretty miserable
5554569 by comparison a hard tour back then sounds like gravy now
5554570 economically and from all angles its a perfect storm for bands
5554571 you see a lot of musicians going back to get their real estate licenses
5554572 the bulk of every dollar we make on performance fees and merchandise is going in the gas tank at some point or another whether it be the current tour or the next one
5554573 so theres not money left over to invest in merchandise or to invest in a new market in brazil or going to do the european tour or japan
5554574 bars are probably giving out a lot more sympathy pizzas and sympathy baskets of wings for not being able to pay bands what theyre worth
5554575 you can get rid of a lot of weekend warriors this way
5554576 its right up there with putting my jacket in the smithsonian institution
5554577 he winkler used the show as a platform to teach morals and values and yet he was still cool
5554578 that statue is well deserved because 50 to 100 years from now that character will still be cool
5554579 they think maybe i just changed stations or time slots or something
5554580 thats really all im doing right now im really proud of it
5554581 this is a much bigger and better way to give back
5554582 computer sales grows bigger as the months move on and the computer business is a very happy one for jb we are relatively new having finished rolling out computer sales in our major stores june 2007 however in our first full year despite a number of stores still making room to sell it i can say that computer sales has strongly contributed to sales profit
5554583 retail is about getting people into stores we sell everything from software music to dvd home entertainment and regular customers that come into the shop walk straight our computer section so in the back of their minds they know to consider going to jb for their it needs
5554584 our customers shop at jb for months on end and make us their retailer of choice for computer purchases
5554585 unemployment levels are steady and people arent losing their jobs they might not be able to afford a holiday or petrol for a long trip so they might want to spend the money on entertainment for the home
5554586 these things are also used to keep people in touch with the world and is integral part of a lifestyle
5554587 jb is doing well because we only deal in it and home entertainment we dont have to deal with furniture and white goods which may be products consumers are forgoing we are also located in shopping centres and not destination only areas
5554588 we have the all important christmas trading period ahead of us we maintain our previous sales guidance in fy09 of circa 2 36 billion or 28 percent increase on fy08
5554589 thanks to the prodigious biological event represented by the discovery of electromagnetic waves each individual finds himself henceforth actively and passively simultaneously present over land and sea in every corner of the earth
5554590 buck up chet open the door even that little bit and the fanatics will charge through
5554591 one merges into another groups melt into ecological groups until the time when what we know as life meets and enters what we think of as non life barnacle and rock rock and earth earth and tree tree and rain and air and it is a strange thing that most of the feeling we call religious most of the mystical outcrying which is one of the most prized and used and desired reactions of our species is really the understanding and the attempt to say that man is related to the whole thing related inextricably to all reality known and unknowable
5554592 in a game where coverage is king 3 had potential to be squeezed these announcements will ensure it remains competitive
5554593 3s announced network expansion is also significant it initially looked like only two 3g networks would be built in australia after network sharing agreements between telstra and 3 and optus and vodafone began however we will now see four competing sets of infrastructure in some areas
5554594 with a strong focus on metro areas and less scale than its competitors 3 must remain focused and not spread itself to thin it must continue to build scale in order to compete longer term so disruptive and aggressive innovate strategies will remain
5554595 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5554596 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the
5554597 when you see the crowd you realize why he had to come out
5554598 his takeoff foot so there is a lot of stress on that area
5554599 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be

5554605 that fucker took three years of my childhood he just took it
5554606 my manhood was destroyed in those three years destroyed but i got it back all back when i killed my first bitch yeah she was a fuckin bitch just like you
5554607 for freds brick and tile store where fred is doing several transactions an hour mostly over the phone the loss of a service such as gmail for an hour or two isnt as catastrophic
5554608 if he made a decision that his primary source of e mail should go through google than thats a reliability decision that he made there are other small businesses who are entirely web based who say yeah im going to own my own mail server or im going to contract with an isp to provide me with a service level agreement and im going to pay for that
5554609 thats kind of like asking am i more likely to have a car accident in a porsche or a geo to a certain extent driving a very high performance automobile puts you at a lot of risk on the other hand the driver is a key component to the whole situation there are a lot of different factors
5554610 as consumers create more and more digital information they are looking for help in securing and managing that information across devices
5554611 our focus has always been to help consumers manage their technology from system utilities to security and online backup pc tools will broaden our portfolio in the utilities category as well as with point security technologies
5554612 we are excited to welcome pc tools into the symantec consumer family and believe the combination of our two companies will provide additional value and choice for consumers worldwide to better enable and protect their digital life
5554613 by adding pc tools we build on the market leading success of symantecs consumer offerings and firmly position ourselves for continued incremental growth in a rapidly expanding market

5554618 if we can avoid a major storm and other problems i see no reason why oil cant drop back below 100 and gasoline return to less than 3 a gallon nationally
5554619 i think we have seen most of the move downward
5554620 refiners are capitalists too and the safety margin has been removed in terms of supplies if we have a major refinery shutdown or a bad storm theres the potential to head right back up again

5554639 a community of people building a church as opposed to a church building community
5554640 on the grounds that it only seeks to pay cheaper flexible severance payments in making staff redundant
5554641 in supporting evidence the union says that because the purpose of the scheme is to help reduce the number of civilian staff by at least 5 000 the mod should use the more favourable compulsory severance terms rather than seeking to make job cuts on the cheap
5554642 prospect says the mod scheme breaches the terms of the civil service management code and the civil service compensation scheme
5554643 whichever way the court rules its decision will have a major impact across the civil service
5554644 the department blames the union for obstructing rafts of people who are dying to get out of the department with a wad of cash

5554662 sweetie i loved making pancakes with you this morning i know youre going to have fun swimming at camp today and when i pick you up you can tell me all about it while we play barbies

5554664 if neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time then im neurotic as hell ill be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days
5554665 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5554666 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5554667 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5554668 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5554669 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5554670 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5554671 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5554672 there were rumors about a sex tape but i had nothing to do with that god knows the truth in all of this and at the end of the day that is the only thing that matters jesus was persecuted and im going to get persecuted ya know
5554673 i knew of brian friel and i knew that mark robbins was directing it
5554674 put those things together and it worked for me so i decided to audition
5554675 he was one of the first people i read for the role who i thought could do it
5554676 everyone i saw audition had to go up against max in my mind because my image of the role was someone of his capabilities physical vocal and sort of larger than lifeness
5554677 she put together some materials dealing with life in northern ireland at the time and some history on the strife between britain and ireland and that was very helpful
5554678 and of course i watched a couple of films to try to get help with the dialect a bit
5554679 it was a very nice film beautifully done with fine acting
5554680 he leaves you asking a lot of questions and you dont necessarily know what he meant when he wrote a given line or even the end of a play
5554681 in this one theres a lot of stuff up in the air when we sign out
5554682 but thats sort of our mission as well to use actors of the city
5554683 and anytime we can eschew type we like to do that i hadnt seen max work in a while and he was genuinely and obviously excited about the prospect of doing this play
5554684 if something comes along that interests me sure ill probably go audition for it
5554685 i dont feel driven to do it since im about to start collecting pensions
5554686 take time to make time make time to be there
5554687 the legend of the last of the outlaw truckers aka the ballad of sheriff shorty
5554688 i got this email from you time stamped for 4 30 am wtf
5554689 only time i can think without someone calling my name
5554690 you guys dont have much problem calling my cellphone 800 times an hour now what will change
5554691 fix is already being arranged fix is going to big and sweeping and is probably going to shock a couple of people but its going to work so get off my back
5554692 there is a fair amount of seasonality in broadband so a dip in the second quarter is not altogether unexpected however the magnitude of this decline suggests that the current economic environment is hampering the ability of service providers to garner new customers
5554693 this is not a situation where existing consumers are dropping broadband en masse
5554694 rather the number of new subscribers is dwindling in lean economic times people are less inclined to assume an additional recurring monthly expense
5554695 if there are any regrets in how much money they are making off of barrels of oil
5554696 you may not have meant it but they sure as hell came they followed you here you two are the reason that i the reason ive lost everything
5554697 nathan i understand youre pissed about what happened but beating the life out of kurt is not going to help matters lets rest a while were good for a while the puppets will more than likely be going back to their master as soon as they know that all of the townsfolk are dead kyo will issue orders for a search later after everyone has returned
5554698 rest how can i rest at a time like this
5554699 how do you rest you sit lean back and examine the backs of your eyelids for a bit
5554700 this is it boys this is the last of our rations make it last
5554701 people are dying out there and you seem like you just dont give a damn
5554702 its not at all that i dont care its just that i started out with nothing and i have all of it left dont take me wrong i care about all the people that have died and i watched a friend lose what mattered more to him than anything
5554703 kurt is different than i am more hot headed and more apt to act first think later kurts lover may was stolen from him shot by the nobles he has more reason to hate them than i do i know that there is nothing we can do until we reach canada i also know that we are outnumbered at least a hundred to one so there is no reason to try to fight now to do so would be suicide anyway lets not talk of this now we probably have about two hours to rest before well have to get moving again i suggest we make the best of our time
5554704 i assume you have good news for me as i will commend your soul to hell if you do not
5554705 i can report that all citizens of heaven are dead not a one was spared sir
5554706 and what of the ones whose tracks were seen leaving the city
5554707 we are actively searching for them now we believe they went underground from somewhere inside heaven we just have to find the point of entrance to the tunnels
5554708 since the founding of the nobles sir i have been your most loyal follower
5554709 as i seem to recall we have known each other since we were children
5554710 well myoto i think it is high time that i gave you a promotion you have been only a captain for far too long
5554711 find the others that managed to make it out of the city or youll all find yourselves meeting the same fate
5554712 i just wondered what you wanted done with him what with you having known him so long sir
5554713 a shallow grave like that for a dog should suffice
5554714 i want half of you to go after the two that escaped from heaven the other half i want here to make doubly sure that i am not attacked and to keep the other cities in check divide yourselves
5554715 my loyal troops i will now need a captain for both of my garrisons
5554716 i want you to command the troops staying here something about a woman in charge makes me feel more protected and in control for lack of better phrasing
5554717 i will exceed your expectations and fight to the death for my lord
5554718 i know what i did to myoto earlier was disrespectful and distasteful some may even have called it evil but know this you are dispensable these troops are nothing to me you captains have more responsibility than any of the others here and you two have been nothing short of faithful servants to me but i will not hesitate to eliminate you if you fail me do you understand
5554719 courage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway
5554720 to find our calling is to find the intersection between our own deep gladness and the worlds deep hunger
5554721 i am involved in dog rescue my wallet and gas tank are always running on empty my house is never quiet and free of dog hair nor is my car my inbox is full of ongoing despair and misery but my heart and soul are replenished with unconditional love loyalty and joy that can only come from a rescued dog
5554722 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
5554723 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
5554724 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
5554725 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
5554726 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
5554727 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
5554728 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
5554729 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
5554730 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
5554731 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

5554744 its impossible to become a fully developing follower of jesus without also becoming a fully developing steward of financial resources
5554745 what sibel revealed to us and has been revealing little by little since january is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the us to procure nuclear designs and parts for the aq khan network and it was done not through pakistani intelligence directly but through the turkish embassy
5554746 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy
5554747 a political odyssey the rise of american militarism and one mans fight to stop it
5554748 sungguh kami sering melihat mukamu menengadah kelangait maka sungguh kami akan memalingkan kamu ke kiblat yang kamu sukai palingkalah mukamu kearhnya dan sesunguhnya orang orang yahudi nasrani yang diberi al kitab taurat dan injil mengetahui bahwa berpaling ke masjidil haram benar dari tuhanya dan allah sekali kali tidak lenggah dari apa yang mereka kerjakan
5554749 hr nasai namun beberapa ulama melihat hadist ini bukan kekhususan diangkatnya amal pada bulan syaban namun
5554750 kami datangi mereka sedang melaksanakan sholat dan kami tingglakan mereka sedang melaksanakan sholat maka ampunilah mereka dihari kiamat hari pembalasan hadist ini sebagai penegasan bahwa allah memang
5554751 akan diperlihatkan amal amal setiap hari kamis dan senin maka allah
5554752 tinggalkan kedua orang ini sampai keduanya berdamai baikan h r muslim
5554753 akan diperlihatkan amal perbuatan dihari senin dan kamis maka saya senang ketika amalku diperlihatkan saya dalam keadaan berpuasa h r tirmidzi dalam keterangan hadist lain dijelaskan pula tentang diangkatnya secara langsung setiap hari menjelang waktu dhuhur setiap hari allah swt membuka langgitnya bagi orang orang yang beramal soleh hal ini isaratkan dalam sebuah hadist yang diriwayatkan oleh abu dawud
5554754 sesungguhnya ketika matahari sedang condong waktu dhuhur zawal maka dubukalah pintu pintu langit maka tidak akan ditutup langgit itu sehingga sholat dhuhur saya senang kalau pada waktu ini amalku diangkatnya amal perbuatan manusia ada juga yang bersifat tahunan hal ini bertepatan pada bulan syaban nisfu syaban pada malam ini nisfi syaban semua amal perbuatan manusia selama satu tahun penuh angkat keatas langit disisi allah swt hal ini telah disinyalir pada sebuah hadist yang diriwayatkan istri rosulullah saw siti aisah bahwasanya nabi saw berpuasa syaban sepenuhnya maka beliau siti aisah berkata
5554755 sesungguhnya allah dan para malaikatnya bersholawat pada nabi nabi muhammad wahai orang orang yang beriman bersholawatlah padanya nabi muhammad dan ucapkanlah penghormatan padanya
5554756 ada lima malam yang tidak akan ditolak suatu doa pada malam itu
5554757 sesungguhnya doa itu akan dikabulkan dalam lima beberapa malam malam jumat iedul fitri dan iedul adha awal bulan rojab dan nisfi syaban
5554758 sesungguhnya allah taala telah membebaskan pada malam ini jumlah bintang bintang dilanggit dan sejumlah hari hari didunia dan malamnya dan sejumlah dedaunan dan pepohonan dan beratnya gunung gunung dan sejulah pasir pasir
5554759 i am very optimistic that this would not continue as far as the milf is concerned if the moa ad is signed but if it is not signed if the signing remains pending i cannot give any guarantee to that cessation of hostilities
5554760 this is very clear to all of us filipino people that theyre using these violent actions against civilians as a way to pressure the government into signing this agreement and i dont think there is anything right about this
5554761 we already told the philippine government to make peace process as a national agenda it would be hard for the milf to talk to the executive the judiciary the senators even pi ol what we want is the government would represent the republic of the philippines as a single unit
5554762 maybe this is what they call the dirty tricks department you do this attack and then you deny this thats what theyve been doing
5554763 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5554764 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5554765 unfortunately a lot of them are not going to be able to be answered in the immediate future
5554766 i dont think no 1 were ever going to put the suspicions to bed theres always going to be a spore on the grassy knoll
5554767 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5554768 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5554769 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5554770 ive been impressed with the things hes done in this league given all the issues and the demands on his time
5554771 i think hes had a pretty healthy attitude toward the league
5554772 who wouldnt look forward to working with a great player thats one of the great parts of this job
5554773 i have a great opportunity in a great environment and i think we can make things much better than they are right now
5554774 we intend to win championships we know its going to take time and take some patience and hopefully a team that will qualify for international competitions and do well there also
5554775 i told them that the team is not about landon donovan and david beckham its about all of us
5554776 its we its us its not i and its not me
5554777 if we work together as a group we can achieve things
5554778 he has an understanding of our strengths as a team and more importantly our weaknesses
5554779 we stepped out on the training field today and unlike any training session weve had all year we immediately addressed those and we worked on them
5554780 our mentality cant be that we can outscore the other team 5 4 we need all 11 of us to think defense we have to give away nothing so that we can give our special players who are special opportunities to get their chances and win the game for us
5554781 after eight or nine months away from the game i was looking forward to getting back into it
5554782 the sun and the weather year round i dont really like i prefer the east coast where its 100 degrees and humid right now and in the winter i love the snow and the blizzards and all im crazy to be here
5554783 my wife reminded me that it is 24 years this week when i first started working with bruce back at uva university of virginia
5554784 when some beet field peon takes a few traces of this stuff he thinks he has just been elected president of mexico so he starts out to execute all his political enemies
5554785 all mexicans are crazy and this stuff marijuana is what makes them crazy
5554786 marihuana influences negroes to look at white people in the eye step on white mens shadows and look at a white woman twice
5554787 under the influence of hashish those fanatics would madly rush at their enemies and ruthlessly massacre every one within their grasp
5554788 there are 100 000 total marijuana smokers in the us and most are negroes hispanics filipinos and entertainers their satanic music jazz and swing result from marijuana use this marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with negroes entertainers and any others
5554789 the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races
5554790 marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity criminality and death
5554791 reefer makes darkies think theyre as good as white men
5554792 you smoke a joint and youre likely to kill your brother
5554793 marijuana is the most violence causing drug in the history of mankind
5554794 in the year 1090 there was founded in persia the religious and military order of the assassins whose history is one of cruelty barbarity and murder and for good reason the members were confirmed users of hashish or marihuana and it is from the arabs hashashin that we have the english word assassin
5554795 marihuana makes fiends of boys in thirty days hashish goads users to bloodlust
5554796 by the tons it is coming into this country the deadly dreadful poison that racks and tears not only the body but the very heart and soul of every human being who once becomes a slave to it in any of its cruel and devastating forms marihuana is a short cut to the insane asylum smoke marihuana cigarettes for a month and what was once your brain will be nothing but a storehouse of horrid specters hasheesh makes a murderer who kills for the love of killing out of the mildest mannered man who ever laughed at the idea that any habit could ever get him
5554797 users of marijuana become stimulated as they inhale the drug and are likely to do anything most crimes of violence in this section especially in country districts are laid to users of that drug
5554798 was it marijuana the new mexican drug that nerved the murderous arm of clara phillips when she hammered out her victims life in los angeles three fourths of the crimes of violence in this country today are committed by dope slaves that is a matter of cold record
5554799 that there is a certain amount of narcotic addiction of an objectionable character no one will deny the newspapers have called attention to it so prominently that there must be some grounds for their statements even woodward was partially taken in by hearsts propaganda it has surprised me however that the facts on which these statements have been based have not been brought before this committee by competent primary evidence we are referred to newspaper publications concerning the prevalence of marihuana addiction we are told that the use of marihuana causes crime but yet no one has been produced from the bureau of prisons to show the number of prisoners who have been found addicted to the marihuana habit an informed inquiry shows that the bureau of prisons has no evidence on that point you have been told that school children are great users of marihuana cigarettes no one has been summoned from the childrens bureau to show the nature and extent of the habit among children inquiry of the childrens bureau shows that they have had no occasion to investigate it and know nothing particularly of it inquiry of the office of education and they certainly should know something of the prevalence of the habit among the school children of the country if there is a prevalent habit indicates that they have had no occasion to investigate and know nothing of it moreover there is in the treasury department itself the public health service with its division of mental hygiene the division of mental hygiene was in the first place the division of narcotics it was converted into the division of mental hygiene i think about 1930 that particular bureau has control at the present time of the narcotics farms that were created about 1929 or 1930 and came into operation a few years later no one has been summoned from that bureau to give evidence on that point informal inquiry by me indicates that they have had no record of any marihuana of cannabis addicts who have ever been committed to those farms the bureau of public health service has also a division of pharmacology if you desire evidence as to the pharmacology of cannabis that obviously is the place where you can get direct and primary evidence rather than the indirect hearsay evidence
5554800 i dont know it has something to do with a thing called marihuana i think its a narcotic of some kind
5554801 mr speaker does the american medical association support this bill
5554802 their doctor wentworth sic came down here they support this bill 100 percent
5554803 president roosevelt signed today a bill to curb traffic in the narcotic marihuana through heavy taxes on transactions
5554804 much of the most irrational juvenile violence and that has written a new chapter of shame and tragedy is traceable directly to this hemp intoxication
5554805 you cant have this in your church its all lies and the church shouldnt be about promoting lies
5554806 pakistan has an 84 software piracy rate which has become an obstacle for the local information technology it sector due to the high piracy rate pakistan has had to suffer a loss of rs 125 million in 2007
5554807 we were running the business together myself my other cousin
5554808 it was just a regular day you know he usually goes there gets some money for the day to day business so hes been here more than 20 years and hes been working 20 hours a day just to make the dreams come true
5554809 it seems kind of strange on one hand to have somebody get robbed coming out of a bank after making a significant withdrawal but on the other hand theres nothing at this point pointing out that he was a target so its all part of the investigation and were hoping that we piece this thing together and make the arrest
5554810 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5554811 hemingway knocked wallace stevens into a puddle and bragged about it

5554815 coach tony sparano said he has a good feel for what running backs ronnie brown and ricky williams can accomplish in games but is figuring out which would be better suited as the starter
5554816 when we brought steve in we really took a look and he wasnt where we thought
5554817 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5554818 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

5554820 we appeal for sobriety and ask for ceasefire on both sides they should go back to the negotiating table and extend the people help we are willing to help
5554821 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5554822 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5554823 i dont think it would be productive for our football team
5554824 theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right
5554825 the rebound in the dollar over the past month reflects a sharp worsening in economic conditions globally rather than any improvement in the us
5554826 we were going to ignore the olympics but now were loading our cannons our weapons of mass distribution is pointed towards china
5554827 what we now need to see from pakistan is political stability and thats very important because in the pakistan afghanistan area is where in our view the current hot bed of international terrorism is he told sydney radio 2gb
5554828 weve got over 1000 troops in afghanistan in oruzgan province in areas abutting the pakistan afghanistan border regions so it has very important consequences for the safety of our troops there
5554829 we want to make absolutely certain there will be no impact domestically on australians as a result of that tax increase dr nelson said today
5554830 in order to stay competitive businesses seek to pass cost increases on to their customers he said in a statement
5554831 this is especially true for woodside given that we are reinvesting 100 per cent of our profits and borrowing billions of additional dollars in order to build our pluto lng project here in western australia
5554832 we dont want consumers to be hit over the head over this
5554833 we are unlikely to vote against that tax we think its a bad decision and has sovereign risk implications but given the revenue involved we are unlikely to vote against it
5554834 ive already announced we will be opposing the tax on ready to drinks the so called alcopops dr nelson said today
5554835 well be opposing the medicare surcharge changes the changes to income streaming for the commonwealth seniors health card and were looking very closely at the luxury car tax and the consequences for the tourism sector for large families and the australian car industry
5554836 the government did not announce prior to the election that it was going to increase taxes by 19 5 billion if were fighting inflation why is the government adding 20 billion in tax increases he said
5554837 we are going to wait for the senate report but from day one weve had concerns about the impact on private health and public hospitals
5554838 on alcopops our position is clear we think its a revenue raising exercise its got nothing to do with binge drinking
5554839 given there has been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5554840 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5554841 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5554842 brown has an international reputation for his fine style a style he here turns on to illuminate the cult of the saints
5554843 the teaching language needs to support or focus on the more basic concepts and that may be slightly different to what is going on now
5554844 nobody is disputing the fact that you need language to build a more complicated set of ideas but language isnt the starter kit
5554845 there is a clear basis on which children can build but it isnt a linguistic basis
5554846 debo manifestar nuestra profunda preocupaci n por la extra a casualidad de decretar un paro c vico que contiene cinismo violencia provocaci n la misma fecha en que en bolivia hace 37 a os exactamente se inici el golpe militar m s cruento nos referimos al 19 de agosto de 1971 cuando el coronel hugo banzer con organizaciones e instituciones cruce as llev adelante un golpe militar violento
5554847 el paro va a ser pac fico el paro va a ser tranquilo no ser una toma de instituciones
5554848 i was running late rushing from my last job to the birds nest for the mens 100m final as i turned the corner with one of my colleagues we saw a full moon rising above the stadium and we could not believe our luck
5554849 i had to decide if it would be worth stopping to shoot this picture and risk losing my spot in the stadium i decided i could shoot this image quickly
5554850 luckily i had a long lens with me as it would have been difficult to capture the image without it i waited a few minutes for the moon to move in line with the torch and this was the result
5554851 no one really claims that estr sic is acceptable simply because it leads to treatments that work the heart of the argument is that a fetus isnt morally equivalent to the person suffering from say alzheimers
5554852 now lets extend this to church movements such as the purpose driven life pdl
5554853 look at all the people that have been led to christ through this book
5554854 with a loyal client base regularly topped up by a fresh generation of users with older players failing to desert the sector at the age originally expected
5554855 using drug injections to torture minority ethnic hmong christians into abandoning their faith
5554856 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5554857 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5554858 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5554859 but my relationship with god is so much deeper now

5554861 there are people out there who cant handle the success of another
5554862 in the days of herod king of judea there was a certain priest named zacharias of the division of abijah and he had a wife from the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth
5554863 as to zeal a persecutor of the church as to the righteousness which is in the law found blameless
5554864 these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god
5554865 there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil
5554866 do we then nullify the law by this faith not at all rather we uphold the law
5554867 for what the law could not do overcome sin weak as it was through the flesh god did sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin he condemned sin in the flesh in order that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit
5554868 this commandment which was to result in life proved to result in death for me because sin taking opportunity through the commandment deceived me and through it killed me so then the law is holy and the commandment is holy and righteous and good therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me may it never be rather it was sin in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of flesh sold into bondage to sin
5554869 the belief that old testament law is as valid and applicable today as it was in old testament times and should in fact be enforced in modern states
5554870 do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them
5554871 i tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished
5554872 given the fact that christ has fulfilled the law what is the law specifically the 10cs for
5554873 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with a promise that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth

5554876 the ten commandments have absolutely no authority over us and we are under no obligation to obey them
5554877 profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training in righteousness
5554878 contain some things hard to understand which the untaught and unstable distort
5554879 the ten commandments have absolutely no authority over us and we are under no obligation to obey them
5554880 let me clarify a bit and say that i dont think that means that religion should be banned from the pulic square
5554881 this fact doesn t give christians a trump card in the debate on public policy in my view just because christians were here first doesnt mean that their views should continue to prevail within the limits of the constitution the majority rules thats the way this government works ladies and gentlemen
5554882 if you really love her you wouldnt feel tired regarding the wedding preparations

5554905 hes all fucked up hes walking up and down the street knocking on neighbors doors i cant have that shit
5554906 yeah he ate a few xanax bars and drank a four pack of la fin du monde hes definitely the walking dead right now
5554907 do you want to go grab him for me so i dont have to
5554908 um not really dude just leave him alone hes not bothering anyone

5554911 thats extraordinary and wonderful and when youre part of that you think ah this is maybe why i went into the movies in the beginning i thought it would be full of wonderful people
5554912 and weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help
5554913 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god
5554914 jen will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship
5554915 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5554916 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5554917 he tips them off he loves the attention jen didnt want to believe it was happening but it was and she has no tolerance for that
5554918 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5554919 unfortunately a lot of them are not going to be able to be answered in the immediate future
5554920 i dont think no 1 were ever going to put the suspicions to bed theres always going to be a spore on the grassy knoll
5554921 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5554922 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5554923 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5554924 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5554925 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5554926 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5554927 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5554928 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5554929 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5554930 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5554931 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5554932 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5554933 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5554934 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5554935 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5554936 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5554937 there are staff that are extraordinarily kind there are staff that are singling her out for special attention
5554938 theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5554939 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally
5554940 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5554941 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5554942 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5554943 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5554944 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5554945 there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u s government with pakistans inability to follow through on what the u s sees as its clear commitments
5554946 it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way
5554947 it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country
5554948 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5554949 it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government there is no more excuse any more they have to stand up and do things they cant blame musharraf
5554950 i really dont think he has been a factor for six months
5554951 he hasnt been able to do that while he was in the presidency and he wont be as well positioned out of the presidency to interfere
5554952 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5554953 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5554954 since the september 16 2007 incident we have said that based on statements of company personnel who were directly involved we believe those involved acted appropriately
5554955 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual
5554956 from our perspective this government is clearly pursuing some wrong priorities
5554957 so we have taken a decision to oppose measures that we frankly dont believe are in the national interest
5554958 as a result of labors proposed reform we will actually see up to a million people moving from the private system back onto our already under resourced public hospital queues
5554959 that is going to compound problems and make them worse
5554960 we certainly wont be doing anything to jeopardise the governments financial position
5554961 uhhuh and im napoleon lets go with the nice men in the white coats

5554975 hes got a savvy about him like hes a real veteran player
5554976 any time there is missing information opinion turns into speculation and speculation turns into rumor
5554977 when coach went there it was a big deciding factor
5554978 a man the other day pointed out that i was never bored i hadnt thought of that before but its true im never bored im appalled horrified angered but never bored the world appears to me so infinite in its variety that many lifetimes could not exhaust its interest so long as you can still be surprised you have something to be thankful for
5554979 this decision by the court is telling every physician and every mental health counselor and psychologist that their beliefs are getting in the way of government as the courts and government continue to pander to a powerful homosexual lobby opposing voices are being silenced and opposing viewpoints are being quashed
5554980 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread
5554981 unfortunately for me that guy was a freak a terminator
5554982 i do want to play in the nfl hopefully one day and i know i need numbers
5554983 im really behind rey and cush and i have to play catch up
5554984 honestly when they first drafted him i was like who is this guy whyd we get him and now i see the guys a playmaker im glad ive got him on the other side
5554985 that was my mind set before the draft even i wanted to come in and contribute early for a team
5554986 normally you associate a rookie with being lost and kind of playing a little bit slower than all the other guys and you can normally point a rookie out and notice his mistakes and i didnt want to be that guy
5554987 i wanted my teammates and my coaches to be able to count on me knowing that i know my responsibilities and i will come through in the clutch
5554988 i didnt know he had those type of receiving skills i thought we drafted him a little bit more as a returner i didnt really realize he could be our starting z flanker
5554989 you dont want to stand out for the wrong reasons
5554990 we had him as the best wide receiver in the draft
5554991 we had him no 1 so we felt very fortunate to get him there in the second round
5554992 you can never press you never know when its going to happen youve just got to stay patient and continue to have faith
5554993 we had him no 1 so we felt very fortunate to get him there in the second round

5555144 everything today felt good thats a good sign if it were up to me im playing but i want to be ready for the whole season its a marathon not a sprint
5555145 its painful to try to flex it too much bend it all the way
5555146 its more uncomfortable than anything the swelling is mostly gone for me to play against virginia ive got to be back monday or tuesday of next week its very possible i cant not practice all week do my rehab fly to virginia and play ill say tuesday at the latest
5555147 as far as im concerned im going to play thats the way ive got to look at it well be fine either way
5555148 hes going to throw the ball to receivers for the first time tuesday well see what happens hes on course to make a recovery by next week
5555149 wed love to have him for the week of preparation
5555150 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5555151 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5555152 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5555153 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey
5555154 the khl shouldnt need a moratorium to adhere to a policy of respecting legal and binding contractual commitments

5555158 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5555159 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5555160 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5555161 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5555162 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5555163 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5555164 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5555165 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5555166 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5555167 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5555168 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5555169 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5555170 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5555171 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5555172 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5555173 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5555174 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5555175 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5555176 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5555177 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5555178 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5555179 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5555180 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5555181 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5555182 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5555183 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5555184 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5555185 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5555186 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5555187 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5555188 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5555189 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5555190 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5555191 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5555192 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5555193 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5555194 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5555195 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5555196 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5555197 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5555198 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5555199 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5555200 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5555201 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5555202 well sir youll have to take that up with northside tickets
5555203 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5555204 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5555205 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5555206 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5555207 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5555208 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5555209 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5555210 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5555211 this was the first day i held all eight together
5555212 im going to prepare myself like i did for these games and be ready to compete in london
5555213 theres some times i still want to hit before i retire
5555214 i always looked up to libby and leisel and now i dont feel any different from them
5555215 im going to be in the sport a while and i want some fun
5555216 this schedule you dont go into it as excited as i feel like i would if i was only swimming just two or three and a relay
5555217 im going to attack it the same way i did swimming
5555218 its a new generation and its now time to step aside
5555219 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
5555220 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
5555221 it is the first time marathon swimming will be in the olympics so we are all on the same path
5555222 we will all be on the same footing when we start the race
5555223 i can get in the water and be free of the prosthetic limb
5555224 it will be a tough race because everyone worked so hard and i am just looking forward to it hopefully the training will pay off ive been training harder than ever
5555225 i remember waking up later and asking my mother when the operation was going to be
5555226 people out there do punch kick and youve just got to get through all that and not get bogged down by it
5555227 what if i cant carry it what if i trip and fall what if
5555228 the standing hurt a little but it was all worth it
5555229 i had tears in my eyes when the flame was lit i cant describe it im so glad i was part of that
5555230 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5555231 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5555232 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5555233 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5555234 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5555235 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5555236 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5555237 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5555238 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5555239 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5555240 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5555241 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5555242 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5555243 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5555244 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5555245 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5555246 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5555247 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5555248 who are open to doing something on the production side
5555249 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5555250 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5555251 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5555252 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5555253 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5555254 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5555255 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5555256 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5555257 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5555258 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5555259 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5555260 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5555261 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5555262 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5555268 we had hoped to have it end at johnny unitas stadium but that may not cut it
5555269 with the pride and anticipation that comes with the spirit of the olympic games
5555270 michael brought that spirit back to life and has made this years games an unforgettable experience for all marylanders

5555275 saya kurang percaya kalau benar benarlah mereka ini penyokong keadilan dan pakatan rakyat sudah tentulah mereka tidak melakukan perkara yang tak sebaik ini
5555276 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5555277 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
5555278 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
5555279 up to this point i never thought it was an issue as to whether to allow her to have a baby
5555280 but the democrats are making such an issue out of it that it might be a possibility
5555281 the draft platform shows a growing understanding that reproductive choice and rights include not only abortion but also the right to have the resources to care for children
5555282 it is very promising that there is a plank on reproductive health care in the opening section on health care coverage although it does not specify abortion we must include the full range of reproductive health care services in universal health care coverage and this will be controversial
5555283 the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
5555284 the language in this platform reaffirms in the strongest of terms the democratic partys solid commitment to a womans right to choose as defined by roe v wade
5555285 we are pleased that the party adopted language that is consistent with naral pro choice americas work to ensure that women have access to a full range of reproductive health options including preventing unintended pregnancy bearing healthy children and choosing safe legal abortion
5555286 we are also pleased that during the full platform committee hearings no debates changes or amendments were raised related to a womans right to choose
5555287 its very clear the party is still for abortion on demand unrestricted and paid for by the taxpayers
5555288 if anyone is taken in by this language then they are not pro life its ridiculous
5555289 government is not reason it is not eloquence government is force
5555290 the state in short subjects people whereas society associates them voluntarily
5555291 the ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy instead of diminishing evil it multiplies it
5555292 excuse me sir you are purchasing a food item that i think is too high in fat for your if you persist i will have to club you up the side of your skull if you resist my clubbing you i may have to use a taser on you and if at any point i feel threatened by you i will shoot you and if necessary kill you have a nice day
5555293 increasing exhaltation of the state and the increasing demoralization of society

5555302 i dont think they have maybe the right understanding of when to hit a guy how to hit a guy if youre gonna do it
5555303 the way they did it tonight just shows a lack of respect for the game and very little knowledge on their part of how to play the game
5555304 im sorry but our it guy has all of this covered
5555305 oh it guys dont know anything about this type of thing they work with computers we use computers as tools for marketing
5555306 ya tentu saja saya sangat senang membalap di rumah untuk kali kedua selalu jadi perasaan spesial bisa membalap di depan rekan rekan senegara dan saya sangat menantikannya
5555307 di barcelona kami menjalani balapan bagus ketika saya harus retired tapi saya harap kali ini saya bisa meraih hasil bagus karena sirkuitnya juga baru buat semua pembalap
5555308 sebagai sirkuit baru saya pikir itu memberikan kesempatan buat pembalap untuk menunjukkan apa yang mereka bisa tapi saya tak mau berharap tinggi tinggi karena saya pikir semua pembalap akan cepat kami harus berusaha sebaik mungkin menemukan poin referensi kami lebih cepat dari yang lain untuk bisa menghadirkan kejutan
5555309 memang benar saya menyukai sirkuit jalan raya itu selalu merupakan tantaangan menarik dan sensasi kecepatannya dari dalam kokpit luar biasa saya akan mengusahakan yang terbaik untuk membenahi pengaturan mobil dengan teknisi sepanjang pekan sehingga kami bisa membidik hasil bagus apapun yang terjadi saya akan berusaha maksimal dalam gp kedua di spanyol ini
5555310 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5555311 never mind that thomas already had been confirmed by the senate to three different positions including the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit the second most prestigious court in the land after the u s supreme court before he was nominated to the supreme court
5555312 never mind that he had accomplished all this after overcoming more personal adversity than any other sitting justice has endured sen obamas comment simply ignored facts and history
5555313 they reveal that obama is ignorant of facts and history misunderstands the constitution and contradicts himself in his own alleged criteria for supreme court nominees
5555314 first of all i think justice clarence thomas is one of the best appointments that have been made by republican presidents or any presidents for that matter in recent times
5555315 ill tell you why hes the only justice on the supreme court who prior to his appointment had recognized the relationship between the declaration of independence and the constitution that the constitution is a means of indicating the inalienable rights that are traceable to our creator
5555316 his is a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person you know in conversation individually
5555317 i think there is a lot we have in common with the speaker on renewables on alternative energy and conservation efforts
5555318 if she pelosi is willing to work a compromise in the open then i think everyone here will be happy
5555319 we know that there is not just one magic bullet
5555320 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf ocs for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5555321 a responsible domestic drilling program means an end to royalty holidays that deprive taxpayers of the royalties they deserve an end to subsidies for profit rich oil companies and a requirement that big oil drill the oil leases they already own
5555322 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
5555323 if its a matter of crafting something in her back room and hoping the nation will just come along with her thats just inadmissible
5555324 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5555325 if pelosi was serious about boosting domestic oil supplies she would call the house back into session to take up such a bill
5555326 but the devil is in the details we urge them to fully lift the moratorium any energy plan that fails to fully lift the moratorium represents a missed opportunity to energy supplies we are opposed to any new taxes on the industry and increase on royalties on federal leases and production
5555327 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
5555328 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
5555329 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
5555330 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
5555331 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
5555332 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
5555333 he ventured forth to bring light to the world the anointed ones pilgrimage to the holy land is a miracle in action and a blessing to all his faithful followers

5555339 id looked at thousands and thousands of web portfolios so i felt like i had a pretty good idea of what was good and bad
5555340 i built these two initial designs these are just what i want as a client and buyer
5555341 im kind of open to the next round of designs coming from what photographers want
5555342 there is so much emphasis put on website design whereas i think the photography trumps all that
5555343 i want these portfolios to be like your black leather portfolio they just hold the pictures and make it easy to look at them
5555344 its a big decision and 1 000 is a lot of money
5555345 once you commit its at least a year long process to create the site so i didnt expect right out of the gate a ton of people
5555346 we re home mom is everything all right where you ll get ready
5555347 i was amazed by the freedom in the japanese manga expression
5555348 through this event we hope to introduce japanese lifestyles into our own through manga culture
5555349 i am attracted to the japanese spirit of teamwork and also to its culture which cherishes old things nowadays futons are more popular than beds among young people here although it does not mean we can become japanese by using futons
5555350 the large manga sales drowned out criticism from older generations that japanese manga were unacceptably violent or erotic said pascal lafine 40 editor in chief of tonkam which has been publishing the french version of denei shojo since 1994
5555351 i was amazed by the freedom in the japanese manga expression
5555352 manga is characterised by its distinctive way of expressing emotions which is different from that of bds which are based on actions and clipped expression
5555353 itu start yang berat tapi kami optimis dengan tantangan yang menghadang dan semoga saja kami akan bisa menghadapinya seperti yang biasa kami lakukan
5555354 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5555355 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in position for things like this to
5555356 but you dont have to worry about how your stuff malfunctioning leaves your health out of control and that doesnt make you think about how no matter how hard you try maybe youll go blind or your kidneys will fail or youll lose a leg or youll never have enough control to ever have your own children
5555357 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion
5555358 weve written to her many times and sent her videos showing how animals suffer for fur but have never received a response
5555359 apparently her beauty really is only skin deep gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child
5555360 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what
5555361 i do actually like it i think its a bit of sport
5555362 it is funny though because it does happen every single time they put out an album when i was 17 and noel was going on about blur i was watching it and now im 30 and hes 50 and hes talking about us its brilliant
5555363 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being c p at everything with no discernible talent
5555364 i sometimes think why oh why has velcro not taken off
5555365 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way

5555370 one might even say that if americans were simply evil they would be a lot more likable
5555371 i didnt go down there to pray or ask the lord for anything
5555372 how marvelous it is of god to allow the fish to breathe underwater
5555373 its not about proving anything you just have to believe
5555374 it seems as though it is a sacred place where several people have had their spiritual needs met through encountering jesus
5555375 i did not have what you would call a miracle occur but i did have a very deep time of prayer and i found it to be a very good place just to meet with the lord
5555376 what i explained to mike is that when people have gone there with a true need they have come out with a miracle those who have gone there without a need have had a deep time with the lord
5555377 since jesus christ is the son of god and is omnipresent there are many places people may find that are good to commune with the savior
5555378 and why not nature its out there and he is the god of creation a place becomes sacred when we stop and recognize that god is there of course god is everywhere
5555379 there might be people who really are seeking something special and would want to go out but others who are just curious may not be the type of people he wants visiting
5555380 i think he believes god is only going to send good people
5555381 there are going to be people who come down here with destruction and mockery in their hearts
5555382 im doing what the lord has picked for me to do
5555383 i know whats going to happen here and im ready for it he has a mission for me

5555386 switching to wine in a box for the 97 percent of wines that are made to be consumed within a year would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about two million tons or the equivalent of retiring 400 000 cars
5555387 the key drivers of the business capacity demand and costs of fuel remain highly volatile
5555388 based on currency market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected yet remains a challenge
5555389 with fuel costs at never before seen record highs for much of the year and airlines around the world struggling to cope this result is a testament to our team and business model
5555390 we have implemented a range of measures in recent months to mitigate the impact of increase fuel costs and we will continue to closely monitor the operating environment and take whatever actions are necessary to see our way through what is expected to be a challenging period

5555399 man or women if you come through our check point we will stop you
5555400 they are not iraqis they are not muslim it is not our way
5555401 the mass violence in the country underscores the chilling fact that the most dangerous place in iraq is not the mosque the marketplace or the military checkpoint but the classroom
5555402 its great that the city was able to get this school opened up
5555403 the school is going to be a wonderful institution not only for the students but for all of ramadi as the youth of the city continue to earn an education they will assist the city and the province in making their country prosperous
5555404 this school will allow young people from all across al anbar to come and learn a trade it also has the added benefit of getting the young males off the streets and giving them something productive to do this school will give them opportunity to become functioning members of society

5555419 never surrender is a phenomenal book by a man of great courage and an inspiring faith boykin takes us with him inside some of the most intriguing special operations in modern american history he explains the magnitude of the threat posed by rogue states and radical leaders who dont simply want to frighten us but to annihilate us i loved every page you will too
5555420 with all your years experience in the pentagon commanding delta force hunting jihadists around the globe
5555421 in your judgment how serious to us national security is the threat of radical islam in the 21stcentury
5555422 when i came into the army in 1971 we were focused on the soviet union
5555423 even though we were fighting in vietnam our real threat was the soviet union but i would say to you joel that the threat that radical islam presents to not only america but to the world today is an even more serious threat than when we were in a nuclear standoff during the cold war and its more concerning to me because this is an enemy that is hard to understand it is an enemy that is easy to ignore and it is an enemy that is absolutely relentless
5555424 well first of all i think that it is very clearly based on their own manifesto that they are adhering to a very radical an extreme interpretation of the quran they clearly believe that infidels infidels defined as those that do not serve allah must either be converted or killed
5555425 i think the worst case scenario is that they continue in their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction
5555426 weapons of mass destruction are available to them now particularly chemical and biological and those are not hard to make but the worst case scenario is i think that they have nuclear capabilities that within these terrorist organizations within the jihadist movement that they intimidate europe to the point that europe is no longer capable of standing against them as they have done historically and that they take their extremism to the entire world and people start to buckle under the intimidation and pressure of really what i would see as a huge islamic movement
5555427 we know that he ahmadinejad has centrifuges spinning we know that he has the technology he has the scientists and he certainly has the determination ahmadinejad is a very very dangerous man in my view i believe that the world should pay close attention to what he has said some would say well thats just rhetoric but lets go back and look at hitlers rhetoric in 1933 and what ultimately occurred
5555428 i think ahmadinejad is far more dangerous than the ayatollah khomeini because given that he now has more resources
5555429 certainly has more money as a result of the oil in iran he has greater weapons capabilities he has a more sophisticated army and military in general and regardless of what the 2007 national intelligence estimate says he is developing nuclear capabilities
5555430 my view is that negotiating with ahmadinejad is a waste of time
5555431 i dont think theres anything that you can appeal to in ahmadinejads view of geopolitics of life in general that would result in any kind of meaningful agreement with the west i think ahmadinejad sees himself as a man who is supposed to hasten the arrival of the mahdi he has even indicated that in his speeches ahmadinejad believes that the madhi will come as a result of his efforts part of which includes destroying or at least subjugating israel and so i think that the threat goes beyond just nuclear weapons i think the threat really is a threat of growing radicalism within iran which is influencing much of the thinking in the rest of the islamic world and ultimately when a man is that driven when a man is that convinced that allah is holding him accountable to do that destroy judeo christian civilization i think to believe that we could negotiate with him in any meaningful way is just inane

5555448 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5555449 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5555450 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5555451 same here i just wanted to say hi and just hear a familiar tone that gets me to smile fulfills my day

5555456 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5555457 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5555458 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5555459 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5555460 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5555461 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5555462 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5555463 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5555464 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5555465 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence

5555502 all he could remember for sure was that curiosity changed swiftly to a feeling that somewhere something had gone badly wrong
5555503 his dreams of disney world had seemed to blend naturally and with a deadly ease into dreams of that thing he dreamed it had touched him spoiling all good dreams forever rotting all good intentions it was the wendigo and it had turned him into not just a cannibal but the father of cannibals
5555504 and the things that are in a mans heart it dont do him much good to talk about those things does it no it dont they are secret things women are supposed to be the ones good at keeping secrets and i guess they do keep a few but any woman who knows anything at all would tell you shes never really seen into a mans heart the soil of a mans heart is stonier louis like the soil up there in the old micmac burying ground bedrocks close a man grows what he can and he tends it
5555505 such a premonition of horror and darkness struck him that he stopped stopped cold he held the baby tighter almost clutching him and gage stirred uncomfortably
5555506 god save the past louis thought and shivered for no good reason other than that the day would come when he would be every bit as unfamiliar to his own blood if ellie or gage produced kids and he lived to see them
5555507 im never going to get married or do sex and have babies then maybe itll never happen to me its awful its m m mean

5555512 if i had my way about it i still would not have published pet sematary i dont like it its a terrible book not in terms of the writing but it just spirals down into darkness it seems to be saying nothing works and nothing is worth it and i dont really believe that

5555514 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5555515 the sotg troops extracted from the area without further incident following the operation
5555516 mullah akhtar mohammed was a senior taliban extremist commander within oruzgan province who controlled a large force of insurgents and directed a strong campaign of intimidation and violence within his area of responsibility
5555517 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5555518 we live in a culture where when men say no its the end of the conversation when women say no its the beginning of a negotiation
5555519 at their core men are afraid that women will reject them at their core women are afraid that men will kill them so they try to be nice in order to avoid violence but in all my years of research law enforcement something that i cant quite recall ive never seen a woman raped or murdered for not being nice rapes and murders just arent motivated that way but i have seen tons of cases of women being raped or killed because in not wanting to be mean they give up valuable information they spend more time speaking with someone that they dont have a good feeling about
5555520 no absolutely definitively means no if you say no and the person keeps trying to push you the first thing you need to think is why is this person trying to control me
5555521 what if someone snuck up on me with a pistol and it presses my spine still yet as if trained by the enemy squeeze twisting out of his grip the gun is in my hands now wow and its loaded let the bullets fly then he drops and as it goes we lay in different places

5555535 as he waited for a bbc interview to begin mikheil saakashvili took a call on his cell phone absentmindedly stuffed the end of his red silk tie in his mouth and began to chew it in an apparent attack of nerves what he did not know was that the cameras were already rolling and the bbc would broadcast the footage on friday with a joking comment about the georgian leader chewing over his next move
5555536 such mental unbalance leads to irresponsible political decisions which lead to chaos human deaths and humanitarian catastrophes
5555537 saakashvili seemed very hungry obviously georgia really is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis and needs the help it gets from the united states
5555538 ki67 nuclear expression gt 30 is predictive of complete response in advanced ovarian cancer
5555539 objective to explore the predictive value of estrogen regulated gene changes as indicators of sensitivity in ovarian cancer patients treated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole conclusion these results suggest that expression levels of certain proteins in ovarian cancers are estrogen regulated and could help identify patients who would benefit from endocrine therapy
5555540 purpose to evaluate the efficacy of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in preselected estrogen receptor er positive relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer patients and to identify markers that predict endocrine sensitive disease
5555541 background activity of tamoxifen as a salvage therapy in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer was evaluated by a number of studies
5555542 background ovarian sex cord stromal tumors are frequently hormonally active and adult granulosa cell tumors often demonstrate estrogen receptor positivity
5555543 aromatase activity was evaluated in ovarian epithelial cancer oec cell lines by the tritiated water assay and the effects of third generation aromatase inhibitors ais on aromatase activity and growth were studied
5555544 although epidemiologic studies animal experiments and receptor studies have shown that not only normal ovaries but also many malignant ovarian tumors can be considered as endocrine related and hormone dependent the place of hormonal therapy in the management of patients with ovarian cancer remains unsettled
5555545 i slept with your wife or husband is not appropriate or sorry
5555546 i finally decided to quit smoking when i found out i was going to have a child that was the thing that sort of put it over the top for me i decided to go to a hypnotist you sit in a chair and the hypnotist sips water and just talks to you for an hour and explains how nicotine is poison

5555552 come on if you must insist on deluding yourself you can cut it as a writer youre going to have to accept that the writers lifes not just a matter of sifting about and writing
5555553 the writer is a media person a successful writer works just like a successful musician a rock star an actor a personality i know that may be hard for you but its not just about being a good writer which youre not no not any more anyway its about marketing and how you put yourself and your writing across you have to meet people people who arent just willing to publish your books but people who are going to give you exposure the right kind of exposure and lots of it

5555560 oh yeah i love all the soaps i really like them in a sort of a way yknow theyre like mental chewing gum a worthwhile distraction from real life
5555561 yeah but the thing is soaps are also like really good as escapism cause they are like effectively microcosms of real life and watching all the bad things that happen to the characters in soaps reminds you that your own life isnt so bad really

5555567 and you look pissed off hardly the sort of look you carry if youre out on a schmoozing spree
5555568 but i could be pissed off because i just lost out on a deal or blew a definite shag or something

5555577 so shes a demanding diva type is she running about throwing tantrums if she doesnt get her way
5555578 im sort of stuck where i am at the minute
5555579 anyway in long term relationships i believe it necessary to give a little be a bit flexible make allowances and so on and besides its only been the last month or two shes been like this
5555580 so youre chronically under the thumb and tolerate her running about behaving like a brat and giving you orders right

5555585 i couldnt agree more im of the opinion that the majority of the true talent goes unnoticed and either remains underground or becomes quelled by the weight of the tide of inbreeding and privilege passing nature of this terribly incestuous self satisfied non meritocratic self propagatory up its own arse scene
5555586 you sound like you have experience of this in a major way
5555587 im just a fair observer an oppressed worker for the corporation and a guy who spends too much time thinking about the wrong things go figure

5555597 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
5555598 these are the times that try mens souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives every thing its value
5555599 the man who will go where his colors will go without asking who will fight a phantom foe in a jungle and mountain range without counting and who will suffer and die in the midst of incredible hardship without complaint is still what he has always been from imperial rome to sceptered britain to democratic america he is the stuff of which legions are made his pride is his colors and his regiment his training hard and thorough and coldly realistic to fit him for what he must face and his obedience is to his orders as a legionary he held the gates of civilization for the classical world he has been called united states marine

5555605 in the third year there was still nothing from the bamboo seed
5555606 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle
5555607 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have
5555608 the bamboo had a different purpose than the fern yet they both make the forest beautiful
5555609 give me glory by rising as high as you can
5555610 kemarin kemarin sudah dapat kabar kalau mau digusur tapi saya enggak mau saya minta tanah diganti tanah ini memang bukan tanah milik saya tapi saya sudah lama di sini masak sih enggak ada toleransi

5555612 tapi hanya satu kios yang habis terbakar yang terakhir ya sekarang ini bisa sampai habis begini
5555613 ada rencana pindah kepikiran jadinya kalaupun ada yang bikin terbakar saya pasrah ikhlas saya anggap musibah terjadinya tidak disangka sangka padahal februari lalu saya baru kena kebakaran empat bulan baru beres
5555614 pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall
5555615 let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself
5555616 whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven

5555628 i pulled isaac out of a hole he got stuck in the mud in his lincoln and we pulled him out he came to the house i got photos from that day

5555631 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
5555632 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
5555633 understand that when youre putting that much caffeine into your body its going to mask the effects of alcohol and youre probably going to feel more sober than you are
5555634 one of the concerns is that when you have a lot of caffeine your heart rate goes up your blood pressure goes up
5555635 now we have double stress on the heart because alcohol dehydrates
5555636 taurine acts as an antioxidant and has been shown to promote detoxification by binding together with harmful substances and thereby accelerating their excretion from the body
5555637 unfortunately herbal supplements arent regulated in this country so you end up with a lot of mythical effects what youre left with is a caffeinated beverage trying to fight that depressant effect

5555662 tidak akan dapat mempelajari ilmu orang yang pemalu dan sombong
5555663 seorang pemalu tidak dapat mempelajari ilmu karena ia tercegah oleh rasa malu untuk mempelajari agama dan menanyakan apa yang tidak diketahuinya sedangkan orang yang sombong tercegah oleh sikap takabur untuk mengambil manfaat dan belajar kepada orang yang lebih rendah derajatnya tidaklah seseorang menjadi alim sampai ia mengambil ilmu dari orang yang derajatnya lebih tinggi dari orang yang sederajat dan dari orang yang derajatnya lebih rendah
5555664 aku berada disuatu kaum yang lebih alim daripada aku lebih aku sukai daripada aku di suatu kaum dimana aku paling alim sebab jika aku orang yang paling alim kau tidak dapat mengambil manfaat sebaliknya jika aku berada bersama orang orang yang lebih alim niscaya aku dapat mengambil manfaat
5555665 tidak dibukakan suatu ilmu bagi seseorang sampai ia mencari dan menyakini bahwa ia kosong dari ilmu itu belum memilikinya

5555676 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5555677 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5555678 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5555679 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5555680 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat

5556288 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
5556289 we know what messages will work and what will not
5556290 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer

5556296 it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint
5556297 dont take a stand that you cant retract later or at least claim that you a meant something else or that b your detractors arent really listening to you
5556298 the love for justice that is in us is not only the best part of our being it is also the most true to our nature
5556299 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience
5556300 freedom is not simply the right of intellectuals to circulate their merchandise
5556301 you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do

5556304 it isnt that liberals are ignorant its just that they know so much that isnt so
5556305 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
5556306 the right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously
5556307 a liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel
5556308 the only truly consistent man is he who will for the sake of being right today contradict what he said wrong yesterday
5556309 im having a lot of anxiety and that worries me
5556310 man is not disappointed by that which happens rather he is disappointed by his perception of that which happens
5556311 if no one is mad at you you probably havent said anything of importance
5556312 sooner or later we all have to choose between what is right and what is easy
5556313 it is not a mistake to have strong views the mistake is to have nothing else
5556314 when people agree with me i always feel that i must be wrong
5556315 share the gospel at all times and when necessary use words
5556316 the early bird gets the worm but the second mouse gets the cheese

5556318 one of the many failings of our educational system is that it sends out into the world people who cannot tell rhetoric from reality
5556319 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
5556320 every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world
5556321 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
5556322 sin can play a big role in making and keeping us humble a contrite spirit is desired by god in order for me to be contrite i must embrace the good and the bad in me and not take either too seriously
5556323 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent

5556328 roaming arrangements for 3g roaming on parts of telstras 850mhz network will be in place during the second quarter of next year
5556329 plans to extend our 3g network means our customers will be able to access their 3g services in far more places and with the appetite for services like the internet on the mobile growing rapidly it makes good sense
5556330 these initiatives will also reduce our roaming costs both new sites being added and lower wholesale roaming costs will have a significant impact
5556331 telstras game changing next g network has taken 3g competition to a new level forcing competitors to respond optus and vodafone both plan nationwide 3g networks vodafone will reach 96 per cent by end 2008 optus will reach 98 per cent by end 2009
5556332 although 3 offers national coverage via telstras 2g network its 3g coverage remains at only 56 per cent in a game where coverage is king 3 had potential to be squeezed
5556333 he didnt do much but its nice to have him back
5556334 it was kind of one of those things where mentally i had to push through it
5556335 after the first game it really settled in for me that i had to bear down and get things done with one arm
5556336 its obviously not an ideal situation to lose your first stringer and second stringer
5556337 i think we have worked hard in making it a non factor at least for me when i played in the minnesota game it was a non factor
5556338 i dont feel that im that far behind because ive been in the film room watching what hes teaching these guys
5556339 the film studying is really helping out a lot so its just all about knocking off the rust right now and getting going i dont think its going to take me long at all
5556340 if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much the last couple days
5556341 hes feeling pretty good he gave me the thumbs up today so if he doesnt do anything hell play
5556342 i feel worse than i did right after the game
5556343 we played a horribly sloppy game horribly sloppy we gained 500 yards against 200 yards and then overtime how does that compute well it computes because we had six turnovers 12 penalties a couple blocked punts it was horrible and i wont stand for it from the coaches or the players weve got to get cranking it was too much playground the other night
5556344 right after the game i was not happy with charlie
5556345 then i looked at the film and charlie got hit a lot in that game and that coupled with the fact that its his first start for us and theres a lot of new stuff weve thrown at him
5556346 charlie is a tough guy and theres some things there that he cant do and he probably wont do them again and hell learn from that but i was actually proud of the fact that he hung in there because he got hit too much in the game i was not happy about that
5556347 hes not going to be 100 percent probably for some time
5556348 again its going to be day to day when he reaches that point but again no concerns there
5556349 david freeman and johri fogerson theyre doing some good things
5556350 theyre getting a lot of the work with brandon johnson and yakaboski nicked up this is really good for them out there they make mistakes and they learn from those but they also do some good things make some great catches make some great runs make some people miss and things like that
5556351 id compare my running style to reggie bush i try to do everything he does i just watch him and try to do all that stuff thats why they call me reggie i try to run like him
5556352 im a balance back i can do both speed or power i take advantage of the situation if the situation calls for power ill try to run you over but if it calls for speed im going to run around you
5556353 im not too big so running people over its in there but youre not going to see it too often im shifty im good at cutting and i have open field speed i like to use what im good at
5556354 i run hard i try to be as elusive as i can but if its near out of bounds and theres a dude in front of me im going to go for the guy you know what i mean if theres nowhere else to go i do like contact im not afraid of it
5556355 daughter cell gene expression is special and now we know why
5556356 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5556357 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5556358 overall theyve done a great job of just trying to push themselves in practice to become better players more fundamentally sound
5556359 if i had it do again i wouldnt have done what i did
5556360 we like them to play with a lot of leverage and you need your hands and you need your feet to compensate for a lack of size
5556361 thats something theyre going to have to master if theyre going to play for four quarters
5556362 its been a process for him thats kind of been uphill
5556363 but hes been getting better every day and just really learning the details of the position
5556364 its nice theres a rotation so when you get tired you can have someone come in thats fresh and get a fresh rush off the edge
5556365 it will keep everybody healthy and fresh during the game so theres always someone giving that tackle a hard time
5556366 it would be bad if we only had a couple guys its nice to have a solid rotation throughout the d line
5556367 i tell the guys every day dont worry about who youre running with in practice
5556368 what matters is that you push yourself and others to just be the best player they can be that day
5556369 i am taking different looks they are some question marks i need to run with the ones so i can get an accurate assess ment of them and where theyre at and see what i have to work with
5556370 in the journey of becoming a good football player its really what is all about
5556371 strengthening is expected tonight and tuesday and fay is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength winds of 119 kilometers or 74 as it approaches the southwestern coast of florida
5556372 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5556373 even though this storm doesnt look like its very dangerous and people will say its just a or its just a category one hurricane our experience with florida tells us that if were not careful we will lose people
5556374 we have amazing waves today something not seen very often on this beaches its a perfect day
5556375 when salt lake countys biggest water district either must enforce water rationing or spend 1 billion on new supplies including a pipeline from the sensitive bear river northern utahs migratory bird oasis
5556376 no matter what you want to do with your landscape or what you want to put on it
5556377 utahns in general have caught on to the conservation ethic
5556378 we can say with a straight face that we still achieved conservation in 2007
5556379 i wasnt trying to give an arizona look to the yard
5556380 women in utah have more kids period thats been the case for many generations
5556381 he was just with his head under water just floating there
5556382 trevor now knows dont go by the pool without a life jacket
5556383 i have some other things obligations that ive got to do
5556384 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5556385 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5556386 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5556387 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5556388 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5556389 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5556390 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5556391 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5556392 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5556393 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5556394 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5556395 scouting is essential if you want to be successful day in and day out scouting is 80 percent of the hunt the more scouting you do the more successful youll be
5556396 access in september to lands available for hunting is pretty good
5556397 these are the nuisance birds and people want to get rid of them as much as possible gaining permission off of private land isnt that difficult but you have to do your homework
5556398 all the gearheads come to have fun we enjoy the scenery the salt has a face to it there is an allure to it everyone comes out to spectate or to help everybody is doing it for the challenge to go fast there is no money and no real glory
5556399 i dont even have to be involved in the future
5556400 in the 21st century it is a shame people like bob gough get published knowing how racially diverse our district is republican will kraus should be ashamed to have a campaign affiliated with such remarks
5556401 either republican will kraus removes bob gough from his campaign and apologizes to the voters of his district for being affiliated with bob gough or he fully agrees with such racist and extremist statements its that simple
5556402 missourians both democrat and republican deserve better than such hate rhetoric i pledge to move missouri forward with real change away from the failed policies of matt blunt and hate rhetoric of bob gough all of which will kraus unfortunately supports
5556403 its the last time that gallant fox will race in a muddy track
5556404 i wonder if the patrons of the track appreciated the sportsmanship of mr
5556405 the travers appears to be particularly unfortunate for colts that have won important races early in the season
5556406 reigh count after his defeat in the travers came back on a dry track to win the saratoga cup and the jockey club gold cup the former at one mile and six furlongs and the latter at two miles
5556407 you certainly can take a licking in good fashion said one of his interviewers no wonder they call you sunny jim
5556408 its all in the game said fitz with a smile ive been licked before and i expect to be licked again but if youre afraid youd better remain in the house and keep your horses in the stable its the uncertainty of the sport that makes it so popular no man has it sewed up
5556409 preparations were completed this morning for broadcasting the event over a long weaf and wgy network
5556410 the handling of traffic was said to have been the greatest task ever imposed on the saratoga springs police department
5556411 jim dandy beats gallant fox and whichone in the travers
5556412 intensive repair work is underway and the oil flow will resume in a few days if there are no other failure in the pipeline
5556413 technical delegations are working on it i will probably go to iran in 15 days together with foreign minister ali babacan we will continue to work to finalize it in a month
5556414 you know what i thought i saw you the other night in a pub
5556415 parfait vous ne nous aimez pas aussi nous nach terons plus daliments ou de parfum fran ais ni de v tements fran ais
5556416 because we started out in photography we better understand the type of photo printers that will meet the needs of photographers
5556417 we will be looking to build relationships with our customers
5556418 this will make it easier for our customers to find original canon ink and reassure them that they are not buying counterfeit products
5556419 we have a strong foothold in the photo printer sector and we believe there is room to grow in the business segment

5556424 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5556425 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5556426 i dont think it would be productive for our football team
5556427 theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right
5556428 came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore ourselves to sanity
5556429 if there really is a god then hes not very nice

5556431 i love that i am present with each person i am with at that moment
5556432 i dont know honey if they will come true exactly as we want them to
5556433 my friend and i will be in thailand just after chistmas until mid january
5556434 railey is one of the most beautiful beach in thailand and it is pretty quiet
5556435 the biggest challenge in integrating data is not just mapping bits and bytes but really understanding these systems
5556436 that domain expertise we dont have its in the heads of the community
5556437 salesforce can handle many calls it just doesnt want them to be large
5556438 the integration problem is a really terrific candidate for open source not only from the development side but the business perspective
5556439 been tuned mightily to move vast amounts of data to do all the things people need to do to build data warehouses for business intelligence
5556440 i see a lot more open source data integration vendors than customers today but do believe these tools can offer add value for certain types of customers
5556441 midmarket companies with less complex requirements and smaller budgets or departmental or project based initiatives within larger enterprises
5556442 every time we give him opportunities he seems to make plays
5556443 hes one of those guys who doesnt look great when you go to individual drills but he just finds ways to make plays
5556444 as the number of cores in cpus increases the demand for more and more memory inside microprocessors grows dramatically making sure that we can continue to grow memory on microprocessors is a basic requirement for scaling
5556445 we can continue the scaling or miniaturization of the circuits for several more generations there is still a lot more room for development
5556446 this shows we are different from an old age mining company
5556447 this is going to raise the bar for mining in idaho
5556448 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5556449 we are delighted to be working with the eerie horror fest this year
5556450 it is always rewarding for us to work with local groups who realize the importance of giving back to their community by being philanthropic the group will be donating at least 3 400 enough to fully fund a wish for one local child from proceeds raised at this years event
5556451 according to the information to which we have access there are already tactical nuclear weapons in the kaliningrad area they are located both at and in the vicininty of units belonging to the russia fleet
5556452 this is no surprise even if there are not press releases being sent out about it on a daily basis but it is worrying from our point of view in a more general sense that nuclear weapons still play a major role in the overall russian doctrine
5556453 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defence shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
5556454 jasic needs to sincerely repent because of the incident he caused
5556455 obviously someone wishes to join the ranks of those who produced the cartoons in denmark several years ago and it is an insult to all muslims of the world especially for us here in serbia
5556456 we hope the release will help strengthen the peace process
5556457 the members of the cell which was planning to carry out terrorist acts inside and outside the province were identified and full information about each one of them was collected and security men are doing their best now to arrest them
5556458 the ministry is saying that contrary to the ynetnews report no bahraini student has ever set foot in the zionist embassy in washington it should now sue the newspaper for the sake of the ministry and the bahraini people who stand staunchly against any form of normalisation with the zionists
5556459 should the ministry take legal action against the newspaper it will have the full support of all the people and institutions in bahrain
5556460 the worlds worst display of womens clothing is the womens olympics
5556461 no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier than olympic games that include womens sports
5556462 what women wear in the olympic games are among the worst clothes possible
5556463 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5556464 the safety and security of the random house building and employees

5556472 so doc look at this engine i open its heart take valves out fix em put em back in and when i finish it works just like new so how come i get such a small salary and you get the really big bucks when you and i are doing basically the same work
5556473 his gaze settled directly on me as he scanned the yard for any other signs of life
5556474 they looked kind of shocked at first but they quickly got over it the rest of the evening they would take various turns asking me what time it was so id run into the den and look at the clock thank goodness it didnt have roman numerals on it
5556475 who knows what else i or any of us for that matter might have learned or resolved if there were more rocks available at those times

5556483 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a c p about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5556484 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5556485 for that matter the thai and cambodian sons you are photod sic with weekly too whos pictures you sell to raise money to help the poor
5556486 used tampons who must be flushed down the toilet immediately
5556487 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support
5556488 if youre a comic and movie fan you know that some damage has been done to the female lead in hollywood for this genre over the last few years so its been difficult to sell hollywood on the idea of something like witchblade because it is based on a comic book and it is a female lead
5556489 when we got a package together with michael rymer who has all the credibility in the world from battlestar galactica as a guy whos not only a visionary but man can this guy get something on screen for the buck we were sure we could get this movie made and thats really what happened once his name was attached to it suddenly everything started moving forward were already in the script phase so were happy about it
5556490 theyre working closely with both michael and us which is great michael understands that witchblade is one of our main franchises and shes been around a long time
5556491 and he senses the fact that we dont want to do anything that would damage her or the franchise in fact were looking to enhance it ive met with him hes brilliant at what he does and he just really
5556492 dewan has a great physical presence she was actually a dancer in her background before she turned to movies so she has a very strong physicality about her and obviously weve got luke goss as another character and hes got some real steam behind him after playing prince nuada in hellboy 2 and the producer gale anne hurd her credits speak for herself shes passionate about this genre and has more experience than most people in hollywood do in transferring this type of stuff to the screen we couldnt ask for more at this point
5556493 obviously you get someone like angelina jolie involved in a movie and it becomes a real thing
5556494 shes great in everything she does but wanted was a movie where we really got to see her cut loose she was a great compliment to james mcavoy and morgan freeman were pretty happy with the success of wanted and mark miller and j g jones are both thrilled but yeah were off to a good start were going to try to really revive our genre now
5556495 comic books have literally become summer in hollywood a studio that doesnt have a tent pole movie thats based on a comic book is going to feel left out at the end of the year and hopefully that will last for a long time
5556496 i think its source material that not only hollywood and the public have discovered but quite frankly that technology has finally caught up with
5556497 so now you can attract top name writers directors and actors to comic book movies
5556498 at least 75 percent of those people in there are illegal aliens
5556499 they are not entitled to work in this country youre not allowed to hire them to work for you and its illegal to aid and abet their hiring in this country and thats exactly whats going on there
5556500 you really dont have any evidence of exactly what was going on there whether or not they were filling out their paperwork whether or not those people going through the door were legal or illegal
5556501 you dont know that youre speculating on that youre putting your judgment over everybody elses and frankly thats not fair
5556502 mama penny were going to nurse you back to health

5556504 molotov cocktail amp squo amp squo bombs were allegedly found when police responded to an emergency call just after 1am aest on sunday in the latrobe valley town of morwell
5556505 this is really a slap in the face to the community
5556506 as real estate values have gone up and different folks have moved into the county theres a different sense of property rights
5556507 theres a learning curve that has to take place with new owners about the historic use of the lands while also respecting that these are private properties
5556508 in every single town from sausalito to novato these historical uses exist many people consider them to be public but all it takes is a change of owner to make an abrupt change depending on the attitude of the property owner
5556509 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge
5556510 litost uma palavra checa intraduzil noutras linguas a litost um estado tormentoso que nasce da pr pria mis ria subtamente descoberta
5556511 entre os remedios habituais contra a nossa propria miseria temos o amor porque aquele que absolutamente amado n o pode ser miseravel todas as fraquezas s o resgatadas pelo olhar magico do amor em que at a nata o desajeitada com a cabe a erguida acima da superficie da agua se pode tornar encantadora
5556512 o absoluto do amor na realidade um desejo de identifica o absoluta preciso que a mulher que amamos nade t o lentamente como n s preciso que n o tenha passado que lhe perten a s a ela e de que possa se lembrar com felicidade mas assim que a ilus o da identidade absoluta se quebra a jovem recorda se com alegria do seu passado ou ent o nada mais depressa o amor torna se uma fonte permanente do grande tormento da litost
5556513 quem possui uma prfunda experiencia da comum imperfei o do homem est relativamente a salvo dos choques da litost o espetaculo da sua propria mis ria torna se uma coisa banal e sem interesse a litost portanto um tra o sintomatico da inexperiencia um dos adornos da juventude
5556514 a litost funciona como um motor de dois tempos ao sentimento de angustia sucede o desejo de vingan a o objetivo da vingan a conseguir que o parceiro se mostre igualmente miser vel o homem n o sabe nadar mas a mulher esbofeteada chora podem portanto sentir se iguais e perseverar o amor reciproco
5556515 como a vingan a nunca pode revelar seu verdadeiro motivo tem que invocar falsas raz es a litost nunca pode por isso prescindir de uma pat tica hipocrisia
5556516 medida que me aproximo dela o seu olhar perde a express o amea adora ado a se enche se de uma paz celeste
5556517 sou uma rapariga simples sou uma rapariga completamente banal n o tenho nada para oferecer mas vim porque o amor me enviou vim para que tu saibas o que o verdadeiro amor para que o conhe as uma vez na tua vida
5556518 o amor n o pode ser risivel o amor n o tem nada em comum com o riso
5556519 era um abra o como ele nunca antes recebera um abra o sincero vigoroso ardente maternal fraterno amigavel e apaixonado
5556520 compreender confundir se com o outro e arder dentro dele
5556521 era t o timida t o delicada que na sua presen a as coisas do amor perdiam os nomes s ousava falar a linguagem da respira o e do tocar
5556522 amava o a ponto de morrer amava o ao ponto de ter medo de fazer amor com ele porque se tivesse feito amor com ele nunca mais seria capaz de viver sem ele e morreria de desgosto e de desejo e ele sentiu se feliz sentiu se loucamente feliz porque atingiu bruscamente inopinadamente e sem ter feito nada para o merecer aquilo que desde sempre desejava esse amor infinito em rela o ao qual todo o globo terrestre com todos os continentes e todos os mares n o significa nada
5556523 como se a luz suja da manh tivesse quebrado o selo do silencio como se depois de uma noite de poesia tivesse vindo um dia de prosa
5556524 n o era a raz o que falava era a litost quem recusa o compromisso acaba por n o ter nenhuma escolha al m da pior das derrotas que se possa imaginar mas isso precisamente que a litost pretende o homem que esta por ela possuido vinga se com a sua propria aniquila o
5556525 quando n o h maneira de escaparmos a nossa litost dolorosa ent o que a gra a da poesia voa em nosso socorro

5556542 i feel like a big family is growing together week after week by spending time in the presence of god it seems like the book of acts 2 42 47 where the believers of jesus left everything and spent time together taking care of each other i am so glad to see people growing in the lord week after week and helping each other
5556543 we feel so loved and cared for in this place when we come to the meetings we feel like we are with family we now look forward to the revival meetings and cant wait to get to them

5556547 clearly quite tight and are getting tighter as commercial banks pass on their increased borrowing costs to customers
5556548 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted the minutes said
5556549 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5556550 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5556551 scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5556552 given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing the minutes said
5556553 firstly a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date the minutes said
5556554 if that occurred the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater
5556555 policy had to take account of this risk particularly given both the recent high cpi reading and those in prospect in the near term
5556556 the staff forecast for growth had been revised down slightly while that for inflation was slightly higher in the near term but still saw inflation starting to fall back towards the target during 2009 and 2010 the minutes said
5556557 the staff forecast for growth of the australian economy over the year ahead had been lowered slightly and remained below consensus the minutes said
5556558 it was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010
5556559 clear evidence of that decline beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5556560 the national accounts for the june quarter to be published in early september were likely to show that growth of gdp had been low and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the september quarter was also possible the minutes said
5556561 members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions the minutes said
5556562 tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but on the other hand the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially to national income and capacity to spend
5556563 visual thinking is an extraordinarily powerful way to solve problems and though it may appear to be something new the fact is that we already know how to do it

5556570 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5556571 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5556572 some people are talking about a 50 basis point cut this would put a bit of a dampener on that which is a positive for the aussie dollar
5556573 it doesnt have the degree of urgency which would suggest that the reserve bank sees itself about to embark on a 50 basis point move or a huge reduction in interest rates by the end of the year
5556574 that in turn is pretty supportive for the australian dollar in the short term
5556575 these condition are expected to lead to higher levels of virus activity and greater exposure of humans to the viruses prof dunstan said
5556576 however australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the ross river barmah forrest kunjin japanese encephalitis murray valley encephalitis and dengue viruses prof dunstan said
5556577 the risk of emergence of transfusion transmissible infectious diseases emphasises the need for countries to work together to help each other maintain their blood supplies during epidemics and pandemics the researchers wrote in their report
5556578 this is particularly important should a major infectious disease pandemic occur in different countries at different times
5556579 random house made the decision to cancel its us publication of the novel
5556580 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5556581 firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some
5556582 however we must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided not to go forward with this publication out of concerns for the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel

5556585 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5556586 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5556587 importantly the sotg located him positively identified him and when it was confirmed that there were no non combatant afghans nearby accurately targeted him for the successful isaf international security assistance force airstrike

5556601 el reto de conocer un nuevo circuito es siempre apasionante en especial cuando se trata de un lugar especial como el nuevo circuito urbano de valencia

5556615 were a high volume manufacturer and were pretty good at getting costs down
5556616 its very clear we have a breakthrough product on our hands but its also clear that many can afford it some cant wed like to make it affordable to even more folks going into this holiday season
5556617 the decision seems oddly timed given tremendous momentum both with consumers and retail
5556618 one of the wisest of men perhaps the wisest man who ever lived maimonides the 12th century jewish sage was also the hardest working we know a lot about him because in the genizat or storeroom for outdated sacred books and documents mentioning gods name attached to the synagogue at fostat in old cairo the very dry air of egypt has permitted the survival of 200 000 manuscript fragments some of which contain information and letters concerning maimonides who lived there for many years following the ancient jewish custom in which the cleverest male member of the family sought wisdom and was supported by brothers who engaged in trade maimonides studied law and theology and medicine and many other sciences he not only worked but overworked so he scarcely had time to eat and sleep tending the sultan as his doctor running a general practice and clinic for the poor writing theology inventing psychiatry 700 years before freud giving judgment and counsel and magistry and in general radiating the kind of commonsensical wisdom most in need in the world hard to think of a more useful life epitomised in the title of his most famous work guide of the perplexed aimed especially at those who sought to combine sacred and secular learning
5556619 we can now be anybody we want to be in this second life and do anything we want to do who wouldnt want to be a part of this

5556622 this is not the time for individual bravado this is the time for serious reflection whether i win or lose the nation will lose in every way it will be a blow to the dignity of the nation and to the office of the president
5556623 therefore after consultations with all my advisers and friends for the sake of the country i announce my decision to step down from the office of president
5556624 god forbid the army should not have to interfere i would never want that
5556625 i leave my fate in the hands of the people of pakistan i am human so i may have made mistakes but my intentions were always honest and im sure the people will excuse me
5556626 he should answer in a court of law for the crimes he has committed against the people of pakistan we feel that all that should be brought out in an open public trial
5556627 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf this is an internal matter of pakistan
5556628 we have been critical of pakistans interference in our internal matters in the context of the recent developments in jammu and kashmir
5556629 lets see how the next match in dambulla again goes we can then take a call
5556630 sehwags injury is bad and he will miss the remainder of the series
5556631 he was the batsman in top form gautam gambhir also got out early we lost the top two performers of the test series but thats the way it is
5556632 you cant really stop and think about the guys you will be missing in the series rather than that you will have to fill in that space because that is the only way your team can win
5556633 this is going to hurt me more than it hurts you
5556634 no one wants to be in the darkness of addiction we have often asked why me why him why us but the acceptance when it comes is freeing the work you do is difficult you have to love what you do and we are thankful bishop gooden home does it so well
5556635 this is very beneficial because we plan on being in that race next year
5556636 the guys who have never been there think they know what it is all about or think they can handle it but you dont know until you get there the importance the pressure
5556637 you get a taste of it and think this is what we want this is what we need it is a long road to get there into a pennant race a lot of our young guys can get a taste of what that long and up and down road is all about
5556638 underlying profit was realistic you would have though the board would have been more generous thats a board in shutdown mode giving shareholders the absolute minimum because its uncertain about the immediate future
5556639 we expect a strong first half for fiscal 2009 having already had a good start to fiscal 2009 mainly driven by continued strong global steel demand and prices more recently weve also seen a relatively lower australian dollar down from its recent record highs
5556640 our asian businesses particularly thailand where economic conditions continue to improve are producing consistent results
5556641 we are excited by the opportunities in the north american market provided by our increasing capability and product offering resulting from the imsa steel corp acquisition
5556642 we will provide further guidance on the first half fiscal 2009 performance during the agm in november obviously the biggest factor in the second half will be the scheduled blast furnace reline
5556643 strong demand for steel ultimately leads to strong demand for raw materials and given the strong demand i think were going to see continued high prices for raw materials
5556644 excessive consumption may have a laxative effect great now you tell me
5556645 struggle with stage fright and sensitivities about appearing too forward pushy or intrusive
5556646 traditionally women feel that if they work hard and theyre loyal they will be recognised and it doesnt work that way
5556647 ken taylor was one of the kindest calmest people i ever knew
5556648 ken was having a hard time standing up himself at that point
5556649 we need to help the pacific islander communities with their economies but at the same time we also need to deal with vast unemployment in aboriginal communities
5556650 youve not just got to look at the industry itself about being welcoming to indigenous people but also look at the policies over the past 30 years which have deterred and impeded aboriginal people from taking up those jobs
5556651 what measures will there be to guard against people overstaying what character checks health checks
5556652 weve had a lot of spirited debate in the state which is great our candidates are separating themselves out from one another at this time and obviously they all hold republican ideals close to their hearts but their policy differences are starting to come out
5556653 to foster a climate that allows families of all shapes and sizes to thrive
5556654 weve always been strong with the republican party and especially at the federal level and i know on aug 20th we will come together as a party and support our u s house candidate theres no doubt in my mind that we wont be successful
5556655 there are the hard core more conservative ones who will vote for him but hold their nose
5556656 mccain has had a love hate relationship in arizona for a long time
5556657 hes working hard to ameliorate those things but i dont think that the effort so far has suggested hes going to rise anywhere up to the kinds of numbers youd expect a favorite son to have
5556658 if mccain were not running for president then obama probably would have a very good chance of carrying arizona
5556659 i think the chances of him actually defeating mccain are not great but not impossible and my guess is it will be closer than a lot of people think

5556663 i did everything right i did everything i was told to do and ended up pretty much getting shafted its like a slap in the face it was tough but i told my dad i just graduated with the wrong degree at the wrong time
5556664 i watched all my older friends and it was happening to myself where we would go to all these businesses and they would want us to be secretaries and do small things around the office and that was just to earn our job that wasnt even our jobs at that time i wanted to apply what i learned straight out of college
5556665 if you graduate with accounting or if you graduate with engineering you have a set pre determined job set whereas if you graduate with international business its so huge
5556666 i asked companies whether they are coming back this fall and they said well wait and see retail financial services things like real estate im still waiting to see if they are going to come back to campus right now and honestly the jury is still out on that
5556667 this whole thing was triggered by todays business society and the pressure they put on kids going to school to get these jobs when in actuality these jobs arent even there these kids should be building their network and establishing business relationships because that is what is going to count
5556668 the vast majority of companies never become great precisely because the vast majority become quite good and that is their main problem
5556669 radio has proven to be the only stable medium during significant public emergencies
5556670 kcsb is the only local station with trained staff on hand 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year who are able to pass on important information during times of crisis
5556671 were happy to find a dynamic partner like kcsb that brings passion for community service reporters on the ground covering news as it happens and a staff broadcasting live 24 hours a day a rarity in modern day radio
5556672 in the past two years weve been on the literal front lines of many of santa barbaras disasters and emergencies with our website providing timely coverage we couldnt achieve with the weekly newspaper but we sometimes found the immediacy of our website was inconvenient or unavailable
5556673 by adding text messaging and email alerts we can use the wide availability of cell phones to keep our subscribers informed add radio to the mix and weve got particularly valuable tools for communication during a power outage or on the go

5556680 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5556681 there is little doubt among wine professionals that the recession has given the bag in the box a boost indeed there has been a minor revolution in the wine business as a hugh sic segment of the market discovered that wine does not have to be expensive to taste good
5556682 finally for folks not terribly concerned with nuance there is a very decent chardonnay to be found in of all places a box
5556683 for the culturally incurious wine in a box is immensely popular depending on where you hang out
5556684 wine in cartons is fairly common in europe but in the united states boxed wines mostly had been associated with lower quality wine
5556685 the idea came to mr johnnes a few years ago he said when he was considering packaging like screw tops and plastic corks and the popularity of high quality boxed wine in europe and australia
5556686 winemakers say that todays boxed wines are markedly better than the thin acidic plonk of yore and american consumers seem to agree judging by their growing thirst for merlots and chardonnays encased in cardboard

5556695 the fec has six members no more than three of whom can be members of the same political party in practice this has meant that there have been three republicans and three democrats as commissioners only stalemate and inaction on key issues have resulted on important issues the votes have often been cast on a partisan basis resulting in 3 3 deadlocks furthermore the affirmative votes of four members are necessary for the fec to act therefore 3 3 ties have led to inaction
5556696 time and time again congress has cut the fec s budget

5556746 haywood left the country from new delhi in the wee hours of august 17 we do not know when he left mumbai as there were no restrictions on his movement within the country however he was barred from leaving the country as investigations in relation to the terror e mail are on
5556747 while haywood has left the country we have now learnt that the brain mapping and polygraph tests he was subjected to have got negative results and show nothing against him
5556748 they gujarat police have identified some suspects they believe were involved similarly haywood and the others subjected to the brain mapping and polygraph tests are our suspects a formal cyber forensic report is still awaited on the e mail matter as well
5556749 these are all issues that will be addressed at a later date i will add your name to that list
5556750 it dulls the ability to finitely concentrate on anything that doesnt have a million things going on at once such as studying law books or history books

5556752 i want to recover for the u s open unfortunately i have to pull out of this tournament
5556753 i didnt go for the big bomb every time i thought id try some different things heading into the u s open

5556760 i knew going in sunday that if i didnt support the budget something was going to happen
5556761 if theres no future for water then lets pave over the central valley and lets import all our food
5556762 i believe it was done because she went in holding the speaker hostage on voting on this budget
5556763 there are two things you do when you are in the majority party when you are in this assembly one is vote on your leader and two is vote on the budget because the budget has been negotiated amongst democrats and it represents the majoritys negotiated budget
5556764 spent millions of dollars ensuring that nicole comes back three times in a row to our caucus
5556765 outrageous that any member democrat or republican of this legislature would force the children and the elderly and the disabled people of california to continue to suffer without a budget because of the narrow interests of their own district we cant let agribusiness corporations hold this states budget hostage
5556766 ich glaube schon dass ich sehr sehr gut in form bin das finale ist mein ziel

5556768 das niveau bei den wettk mpfen hier ist extrem hoch
5556769 das 3 m finale der damen zum beispiel war ein wahnsinn
5556770 ich muss mir noch gedanken machen warum das niveau derart hoch gegangen ist
5556771 daher sind wir auch nicht ins oc camp nach hongkong gefahren
5556772 sondern gleich zum eingew hnen auf die anlage nach peking
5556773 man hat die augen offen und ich z hle auch zus tzlich mit

5556787 there was no warning there was just a popping sound and the next thing we know the car was on fire and the community came out to help
5556788 i raced home and got the fire extinguisher but by the time i got back to the end of the street it was too late
5556789 we provide refuge to families affected by domestic violence foster care child neglect you name it we pretty much do it
5556790 hoe komt het dat mijn site veranderd is in de r
5556791 we advocated that rather than more information on the sidewall better the information be required at the point of sale
5556792 right now that tire efficiency data is not widely available
5556793 cost effective for consumers and the nation to reduce oil use
5556794 people seem to be very comfortable with it not a lot of questions about it
5556795 we get a large number of absentees that come in the day after the election so were still expecting that well have some spikes but right now its fairly low
5556796 because they are violent sex offenses or class a felonies if hes convicted as charged a sentence would include a possibility of a life term
5556797 my message to them is to take care of their kids and know for the time being i think their kids are safe because mr martinez is behind bars
5556798 he did mention it was something he wanted to let go and there were times he felt like he was over it but it would come over him again

5556801 at one time second life was viewed as having great potential for promoting political campaigns
5556802 the closer we get to steins the more accurate our knowledge of the asteroids position relative to rosetta will be
5556803 thanks to rosettas cameras we will obtain increasingly precise measurements that will allow us to adjust again if necessary rosettas orbit for an optimal asteroid encounter
5556804 both of rosettas navigation cameras could already see the asteroid from the very beginning of the tracking campaign despite the long distance from steins and contrary to what we expected
5556805 it is the first time ever that we have used optical instrumentation on board a scientific spacecraft for navigation as opposed to the usual techniques based on analysing radio signals
5556806 the exceptional results are really encouraging and we look forward to using this technique again in the future if and when it is possible
5556807 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
5556808 tiffany must ultimately bear the burden of protecting its trademark
5556809 the issue is whether ebay continued to provide its website to sellers when ebay knew or had reason to know that those sellers were using the website to traffic in counterfeit tiffany jewelry the court finds that when ebay possessed the requisite knowledge it took appropriate steps to remove listings and suspend service
5556810 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
5556811 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
5556812 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
5556813 you have know idea how that is killing me inside

5556818 clearly quite tight and are getting tighter as commercial banks pass on their increased borrowing costs to customers
5556819 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted the minutes said
5556820 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5556821 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5556822 scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5556823 given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing the minutes said
5556824 firstly a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date the minutes said
5556825 if that occurred the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater
5556826 policy had to take account of this risk particularly given both the recent high cpi reading and those in prospect in the near term
5556827 the staff forecast for growth had been revised down slightly while that for inflation was slightly higher in the near term but still saw inflation starting to fall back towards the target during 2009 and 2010 the minutes said
5556828 the staff forecast for growth of the australian economy over the year ahead had been lowered slightly and remained below consensus the minutes said
5556829 it was likely that the headline rate of inflation would rise further in the immediate future but the softer demand outlook meant that inflation was still forecast to decline during 2009 and to be consistent with the target during 2010
5556830 clear evidence of that decline beginning however was unlikely to be seen for a while yet
5556831 the national accounts for the june quarter to be published in early september were likely to show that growth of gdp had been low and the staff forecasts suggested that a weak outcome in the september quarter was also possible the minutes said
5556832 members continued to see considerable uncertainty about the outlook for demand and inflation as the economy remained subject to powerful forces pulling in opposite directions the minutes said
5556833 tighter financial conditions were causing the economy to slow but on the other hand the rise in the terms of trade would continue to add substantially to national income and capacity to spend
5556834 hemos querido que la fachada desprenda alegr a en un entorno de deporte y salud y resulta muy llamativa por los espacios abiertos en que se ubica

5556850 se est convocando a la poblaci n por los abusos que la polic a cometi contra los discapacitados
5556851 la gasificaci n continu anoche la polic a corri a los j venes unionistas
5556852 nos est n llamando y criticando por mostrar los rostros de los que agredieron al comandante en pat no estamos de acuerdo con la violencia
5556853 lo que ha ocurrido hoy en santa cruz es el inicio de lo que parece ser un plan una escalada de actos violentos que ya lo han anunciado algunos dirigentes c vicos para el martes 29 de la pr xima semana convocando a un paro y dijeron que lo haran respetar por la fuerza de la violencia
5556854 los discapacitados fueron utilizados como punta de lanza de una movilizaci n y por detr s de ellos ven an los c vicos diputados de podemos y unionistas
5556855 estaban azuzando la violencia para agredir a una de las instituciones m s importantes del pa s como es la polic a nacional
5556856 por lo que cualquier intento de neutralizar agredir o reemplazar a una instituci n como la polic a nacional ser un intento destinado al fracaso
5556857 los indignados empiezan a ocupar el lugar de los indignos en am rica
5556858 ahora los indignados empiezan a ocupar el lugar de los indignos en numerosos gobiernos de nuestros pa ses con una conciencia diferente este proceso de cambios que est empezando con tantas ganas con una energ a creadora que viene desde abajo y justo por esto ser capaz de construir una realidad diferente
5556859 la mal llamada libertad de comercio es una libertad que enjaula y una gran mentira porque es el nombre que el norte del mundo da a todo lo que no practica pero es todo lo que predica y como el paraguay de los l pez cometi el grave pecado de proteger sus propios productos e impedir el paso de la avalancha de los productos brit nicos y no se at al cuello la soga de la deuda externa que nos ahorca fue castigado
5556860 para saber si un gobierno rey o presidente agrada o no a dios hay que preguntar c mo ese gobierno trata a los pobres porque si los trata bien significa que est del lado de dios
5556861 como gobierno tenemos el mandato de un pueblo que nos ha dicho sigan adelante y sigan transformando con humildad y compromiso lo recogemos y lo haremos cumplir pese a quien le pese

5556864 both of rosettas navigation cameras could already see the asteroid from the very beginning of the tracking campaign despite the long distance from steins and contrary to what we expected
5556865 the exceptional quality of the osiris scientific camera namely its angular resolution provided data as accurate as expected and made our current trajectory calculations very precise
5556866 it is the first time ever that we have used optical instrumentation on board a scientific spacecraft for navigation as opposed to the usual techniques based on analysing radio signals
5556867 the exceptional results are really encouraging and we look forward to using this technique again in the future if and when it is possible

5556891 im gonna remarry my one and only true love tommy
5556892 ive never forgotten it and i never will that has been in the back of my mind since then
5556893 four coaches in four years thats not a recipe for success
5556894 when i came aboard we were as close to a dysfunctional family as youd find they didnt really believe in themselves and they werent a good team there were a lot of great players but they were individuals it hits me in the heart to see how far these guys have come its magnificent to see the human spirit and see how much a team can come together
5556895 i think were a team of people who could win we just were not able to take the next step
5556896 russia threw a game so they could play us instead of yugoslavia in the semis we were so pissed off we kicked the crap out of them if serbia gets that far well be ready for them
5556897 its an honor to be mentioned in the same breath as edwin moses
5556898 i knew we could do it we were talking about a u s sweep at the olympic trials we have a great group of young intermediate hurdlers i knew we had a great chance of doing the sweep the usa hasnt had a great showing so far we tried to provide a lift
5556899 every time we give him opportunities he seems to make plays
5556900 hes one of those guys who doesnt look great when you go to individual drills but he just finds ways to make plays
5556901 were getting close and today will be one more opportunity for guys to show what they can do
5556902 from there we have to create a depth chart because its time to start preparing for michigan state
5556903 its more a matter of deciding who will take the first snaps than it is a matter of naming a starter
5556904 you dont talk about the loss but its there people remember its extra incentive to train hard work hard and were just thrilled to see them again in this kind of platform
5556905 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
5556906 just like anything its not even necessarily a negative if you spin it the right way
5556907 we learned so much from last year were a stronger team now i know hopes probably very excited to see brazil as is the whole team
5556908 it has nothing to do with those shots that was 10 months ago
5556909 i dont think its personal for me anymore i think its our team wanting to reclaim what we gave back
5556910 we dont have that big name player that abby wambach mia hamm people dont really know us and our team gets energy from that
5556911 the seven fatal mistakes that almost every business owner makes on their web site
5556912 i really need to talk to you please call back as soon as you see this message
5556913 people want what they do not or cannot easily have
5556914 are you ready to make thousands of dollars every week working less than one hour per day
5556915 if your looking the arcade its not here anymore were the sirens of ti and its an adult party
5556916 brain around how this fits into the larger sun story
5556917 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5556918 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5556919 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5556920 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5556921 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5556922 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5556923 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5556924 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5556925 were concerned about parents dropping off their kids at a bus stop
5556926 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5556927 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5556928 we are very susceptible for tornadoes as the northeast part of the storm passes us
5556929 were starting to get the effects of the weather as it moves up
5556930 weve seen a little bit of a lift in plywood sales but nothing tremendous
5556931 we came specifically to see if they have a generator
5556932 there has been quite a bit of change in business for propane candles flashlights and batteries
5556933 you spend months getting them up then youve got to figure out how to get them out
5556934 some thieves already relieved me of the burden of picking them up
5556935 thats a guy who actually stalks me on the web and once stalked me personally
5556936 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5556937 when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace
5556938 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying position on the surge in iraq
5556939 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure this was back when supporting americas efforts entailed serious risk
5556940 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5556941 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded of 10 days ago by the events in the nation of georgia
5556942 would be very good for people who are rich or healthy and never use health care
5556943 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5556944 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5556945 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5556946 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5556947 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5556948 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5556949 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5556950 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5556951 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5556952 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5556953 i dont think it would be productive for our football team
5556954 theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right
5556955 if we can avoid a major storm and other problems i see no reason why oil cant drop back below 100 and gasoline return to less than 3 a gallon nationally
5556956 i think we have seen most of the move downward
5556957 refiners are capitalists too and the safety margin has been removed in terms of supplies if we have a major refinery shutdown or a bad storm theres the potential to head right back up again
5556958 if they had been forced to produce the car theyd be in the catbird seat now instead of losing billions every quarter
5556959 people thought gee is this pat robertson and jerry falwell
5556960 there are millions of americans across this country for whom faith is important
5556961 and whether they vote on the basis of their faith or whether they vote about issues that are somehow connected to their faith we should be reaching out to them
5556962 there are shades and gradations of what it means to be a democrat
5556963 were not all los angeles new york birkenstock wearing democrats
5556964 the top issues are no longer just abortion and gay marriage
5556965 people thought gee is this pat robertson and jerry falwell
5556966 we want people of faith to know that barack obama is a viable option and a candidate whos not ashamed to stand up and talk about his values
5556967 democrats have developed a keen awareness of the problem and theyre seriously engaged in trying to narrow the gap
5556968 that in itself is a significant change from 2000 and 2004
5556969 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5556970 love is giving someone the power to hurt you greatly and hoping they dont
5556971 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5556972 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
5556973 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
5556974 love is giving someone the power to hurt you greatly and hoping they dont
5556975 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5556976 i have been a huge fan of his for many years and would love to see him healthy again
5556977 do you remember the vietnamese hunter in wisconsin ill come back and kill all of you
5556978 do you remember virginia tech ill mow all of you down
5556979 i would be worried myself especially the little kids especially cause theres probably about 50 kids in this camp and theyre all probably id say below the age of 12
5556980 it was kind of disturbing you dont want to hear that stuff
5556981 would he really actually carry a gun and use it and since theres a lot of that happening around here we dont need it on this beach we dont need it in this area we dont need it in this state

5556986 she wrote three guides for members who wanted to teach others about islam on the groups website siddiqui explained how to run a dawah table an informational booth used at school events to educate people about and persuade them to convert to islam
5556987 imagine our humble but sincere dawah effort turning into a major dawah movement in this country
5556988 not going out of her way to be noticed by anybody or to be anyones friend she just came out here to teach us about allah and english wasnt even her first language
5556989 she shared with us that we should never make excuses for who we are
5556990 how many people in this room own more than one pair of boots
5556991 so donate them to these bosnians who are about to face a brutal winter
5556992 this is a woman who attempted to blast her way out of captivity
5556993 it was her decision as she refused to by seen by a male doctor
5556994 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers
5556995 if ghayrah protective jealousy leaves a persons heart his faith will follow it
5556996 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
5556997 had set up meetings with red hat in part to position vmware as friendly to open source and possibly as a prelude to a buyout discussion
5556998 traditionally people have tied their software to their hardware virtualization changes all that
5556999 at present one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured
5557000 a further 44 walking wounded patients have been taken to the medical centre at alton towers and are being treated by medical staff and doctors
5557001 we will have certified inspectors at the site they will check car seats make sure theyre serviceable the child fits and its installed properly
5557002 we are looking not just for anybody to buy this building but someone with a do able plan and i believe mr kaplan and his partner are the people to do just that
5557003 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5557004 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5557005 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5557006 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5557007 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5557008 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5557009 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5557010 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5557011 her knee was hurting too much after the prelim she had to take a day off
5557012 the main thing is that this was a knee that was completely reconstructed when she was 15 and we knew and she injured it again by landing it in a way that wouldnt have injured a healthy person she bent her knee further from the previous injury
5557013 and when somebody has a knee like that you dont expect them to have as long a career so shes really pushed herself a lot
5557014 those kinds of images have a great effect on children and what they think they might want to do or how they can do
5557015 that there arent too many people with three medals in the olympics that puts her in a pretty high status right away and you know the statistics dont really do her justice for example
5557016 the way an athlete is and how they set a good example
5557017 to come back from that be determined to get back and ride after an injury like that
5557018 hes been another parent for me and for my husband
5557019 thats something that medals and that it means so much more
5557020 the rise of the rexics another illness that we made up earlier
5557021 perhaps in this age of choice we just wanted more options perhaps we had tired of running articles about the same old life threatening eating disorders either way we had decided to expand our horizons
5557022 because of the regulations we have in place its safer than riding your bicycle down the road
5557023 we would say that our standard is better which should translate into less risk
5557024 but as with any outdoor activity there is an inherent risk associated with the activity
5557025 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5557026 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5557027 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5557028 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5557029 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5557030 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5557031 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5557032 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5557033 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5557034 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5557035 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5557036 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5557037 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5557038 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5557039 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5557040 itll be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5557041 the degree and depth of whats happening in the financial industry is beyond anything weve seen in decades and it takes time to get your arms around the severity of whats happening and what the long term and short term ramifications are
5557042 a new portal which wendy alec though through which we could shine our little lights to the world
5557043 the sky is blue but it also has a few white clouds
5557044 i was saddened and horrified to be confronted with the graphic and frankly gratuitous image of dead childrens bodies on the front page
5557045 our first priority is right here in our local community
5557046 so we want to make sure if we are going to be affected by a big storm we will have our resources ready and available here first
5557047 we want to make sure that that debris is not there in case fay does come our way and cause some flooding
5557048 that gives us time to get out and take a look at places that are possible flood areas

5557053 president musharrafs decision to step aside is a welcome development for the people of pakistan his resignation is the latest reminder of the perils of this administrations personality driven foreign policy that turned a blind eye to pakistans people president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has reemerged in pakistans tribal areas pakistans politicians must shift their focus from each other to preventing al qaeda and taliban forces from seeking safe havens from which to launch their next attacks over the long term the best way to fight extremism is for pakistans politicians to use this opportunity to strengthen their democracy and deliver an economic plan that can improve the lives of their people this ultimately is their fight and their future but for their sake and ours america needs to help them succeed
5557054 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance

5557160 and robbie can play along with that for many years to come and thats the striking thing that he should be looking forward to at this stage
5557161 it will be great if he does but at the end of the day its up to him and well just see what happens
5557162 hes very important hes a great player to have around the club a great person and a great football player

5557207 i havent heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos payday loans predatory lending asbestos lead whats keeping him from doing that is it because he wants to talk white
5557208 obama fits the stereotype blacks once labeled as an oreo a black on the outside a white on the inside does it frost jackson jesse jackson that an oreo should be the beneficiary of the long civil rights struggle which jesse jackson spent his lifetime fighting for
5557209 is he acting white and talking down to black people

5557218 but besides the knock down drag out political fighting in new hampshire were asking the question this morning on everyones mind is america finally colorblind
5557219 when senator barack obama won the iowa caucuses he became the first presidential candidate of color to achieve a significant victory in the race for the white house
5557220 is america ready to elect its first african american president
5557221 we still live in an america where don imuss you know racially charged comments cause a furor and he ends up losing his job we still live in an america of the jena 6
5557222 what is the greater obstacle for you in the presidential contest hillarys political machine or americas inherent racism
5557223 you cant shuck and jive at a press conference you cant just put off reporters because you have real people looking at you saying answer the question you know and all those moves you can make with the press dont work when youre in someones living room
5557224 the attacks against ordinary blacks who do not support barack obama are nasty enough but they pale in comparison with the abuse being absorbed by members of the congressional black caucus
5557225 i see nothing wrong with that for about 140 years blacks have been voting for white candidates and now there is finally a viable black candidate why on earth wouldnt they support him arent black columnists people citizens and voters
5557226 causing a lot of trouble for a lot of people forcing them into silence
5557227 because of the halo effect too many people are afraid to sincerely criticize obama for fear of being attacked many anglo democrats who do not support obama are keeping their heads down and mouths shut most of our acerbic political cartoonists who have no trouble portraying clinton as a gargoyle have sheathed their rapiers for obama
5557228 if obama is elected we will be reluctant to challenge him fearing that the albatross of racism will come crashing down on us
5557229 specifically resisted crediting the legal system as important to white advantage
5557230 whether whites see the problem of race as one of white privilege as opposed to african american disadvantage
5557231 if one looks at the response patterns for african american disadvantage one might conclude that most white americans would be supportive of policies designed to equalize opportunities for african americans it is not until looking at the response patterns for white advantage that we can see that white americans may not be overtly racist but may in fact have very different if not naive and simplistic visions of the social system of race this is an important finding with implications for how we understand the policies americans adopt or fail to adopt to challenge racial inequities
5557232 we understand that history matters but dont want to see how it pervades our culture its kind of surprising but also really typical of how americans cant reconcile race problems that to me is a reflection of how historical and individualist so many americans are to support affirmative action per se you have to have a historical understanding of where these problems come from

5557262 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate

5557295 first let us be clear about the nature of senator obamas attack today
5557296 he used the words losing his bearings intentionally a not particularly clever way of raising john mccains age as an issue this is typical of the obama style of campaigning

5557304 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5557305 could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5557306 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end
5557307 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5557308 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of sen obama
5557309 the old john mccain wouldnt have allowed one of jack abramoffs top cronies to raise money for him

5557332 it never went out in the press that he was here never
5557333 no one ever knew the depth of the relationship between them
5557334 when he passed away when we went to the funeral it was hard it was an honor for me to have someone like him look up to me
5557335 im sure hes looking down on us and im sure hes cheering from above
5557336 nope she did exactly what you said she may have done it her way but she did exactly what you told her and the handbook doesnt say anything about barking while she did it

5557341 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is its military power
5557342 i think the french will undoubtedly be seeking from the russians an explanation for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5557343 i believe his bill is one of the vehicles upon which health reform will occur in congress

5557346 anything we can do to get us off carbon is good and no one has done more than me in the senate to get that done
5557347 i dont think in our lifetime oregon will want to do it
5557348 and i dont think the federal government should mandate it i think a state that wants to do it should be allowed to do it
5557349 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5557350 theres a bit of a down draft from what happened in the u s overnight and commodities are a bit weak too
5557351 he wanted to give them an idea of where he wanted to go with this
5557352 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5557353 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5557354 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5557355 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5557356 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5557357 theyve been banged up real good and theyre starting to run out of games
5557358 maybe i should be worried but worrying is not going to do me any good besides the teams playing hard im not defending our record im just defending the effort i think this teams getting better
5557359 we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists
5557360 its not only a threat to the united states western europe and the whole free world but its a threat to pakistan as well
5557361 we are committed to fight against those extremists and terrorists who are destroying and making the world not safe
5557362 whats very troubling for the americans is most pakistanis think that the war on terror is not their war its our war
5557363 a step toward moving pakistan on to a more stable political footing

5557625 kalau saja dia berterus terang kejadiannya tentu tidak seperti ini minimal kita bisa mendesak laki laki yang telah menghamilinya untuk bertanggung jawab kalau ditanya baik baik dia malah mengelak dan bilang bahwa tubuhnya sedang mengalami kegemukan
5557626 menurut informasi yang saya dapat dari warga malah nur sendiri hadir pada saat proses penggalian kuburan bayi itu
5557627 sedari paginya handuk itu sudah dicari cari istri saya kakak kandung nur red tapi tidak diketemukan temuan ini kembali membangkitkan kecurigaan terhadap nur jangan jangan selama ini nur memang benar hamil dan bayi itu milik dia
5557628 sampai malam tadi minggu malam red bapak belum juga pulang beliau benar benar terpukul dan malu dengan kejadian ini

5557631 kami melakukannya atas dasar suka sama suka lagi pula dia tidak pernah bilang bahwa dia itu hamil apalagi mengajak kawin sama sekali tidak pernah dia itu bohong
5557632 kita lalu mengirimkan tim identifikasi dan tim buser untuk mengecek tkp dan ternyata benar ditemukan mayat bayi lakilaki dan masih lengkap dengan tali ariarinya
5557633 dalam waktu sekitar 6 jam atau sekitar pukul 22 00 wib akhirnya kita berhasil menemukan tersangkanya yakni sab setelah diperiksa akhirnya dia mengakui sudah menguburkan bayinya tersebut

5557653 the popularisation of laozihao or time honoured brands has been at the centre of our marketing campaign

5557771 jobs are leaving our state and our current governor mitch daniels doesnt seem to have the appropriate answers i think what jill is concerned about with the privitization of jobs is the same thing she was concerned about when she served in the u s congress when they were talking about trade deals like nafta she voted against nafta she seemed to have the intellect and the understanding that it would be bad for hoosier workers that we would see jobs lost that the jobs that remained would earn lower wages have less benefits i think privatization is another way to bring the standard of living down for workers in indiana
5557772 before the chinese invasion the tibetan people lived in harmony with their nobility in a social order inspired by religious teachings
5557773 tibet has become strategically and ideologically important since the independence of tibet can aid the fight against communism it is of our interest to recognize it as independent rather than regarding it as belonging to china
5557774 the situation would change if a government in exile is created in this case it is in our interest to support it without recognizing tibets independence to recognize the independence of tibet yes or no is not the true question it is about our attitude towards china
5557775 as soon as socialist china took over the direction in 1951 the dalai lama and the tibetan nobility lost all their political power in tibet

5557805 the more convenient is the killer i dont mind paying a reasonable amount for a game but i wont buy it if it treats me like a criminal i wont pirate it either ill just ignore it i bought ev nova a few years ago i copied it across to a new computer when i replaced my old one and it told me i had to re authenticate unfortunately i had to authenticate via a protocol that was blocked by a firewall between me and their servers i bought some games that needed the cd in to run playing them years later often i couldnt find the cd or it was scratched or i wanted to play them on a laptop on a train and the cd drive flattens the battery too quickly i bought some with a serial number but came to install them later and found that i could find the cd but not the case with the serial number on it compare this with the pirated version of any game its typically an archive which you extract and then run no fuss no effort nothing getting in the way of enjoying the game anti piracy measures only ever affect the legitimate users pirates have fun circumventing them and then arent bothered by them once theyre cracked
5557806 there have been no arrests yet for the murder of the former city prosecutor it is a crime that has stunned the city and drawn statewide attention the body of the former prosecutor was found bound and stabbed in the basement of his home his family had just returned from a vacation in florida that same day his wife says that she last saw her husband after they put their children to bed that evening she then went to sleep in the couples bedroom and her husband went downstairs planning to work late into the night police are withholding evidence about a possible break in dna found on the body was tested and did not match anyone in the household however the district attorney publicly announced that they were not ruling out any suspects at this time

5557821 lisaraye mccoy misick and her publicist lynn allen jeter had a busy week dealing with the aftermath of the actress fight with her husband turks and caicos islands premier michael misick there was no pushing there was no slugging there was no swinging of arms there was no tussle nothing like that
5557822 her personal security travis was driving lisaraye was in the back seat i was in the passenger side of the jeep
5557823 we pulled up to her home we had been to the grocery store shed bought food to make tacos so we had groceries in the back of the car we got up to the house the guards spoke to her and then proceeded to pick up the phone lisaraye said oh you dont have to pick up the phone to announce me but he proceeded to do so and closed the door to the guard shack with lisaraye standing there
5557824 he caught her between the door and him her security travis then got out of the car and pulled the door so the guard would not hurt her
5557825 travis never touched the security guard at all lisaraye then walked through the guard house into the property of her home travis was behind her and i was sitting in the truck on the passenger side i then got behind the drivers seat and backed the truck up
5557826 contrary to michael misicks earlier statement claiming that jeter accompanied lisaraye and travis into the home jeter says she was not with the cousins when they walked inside
5557827 but what ive been told by lisaraye and travis is that there was no belligerence
5557828 when they arrived michael was having a meeting with some of his ministers on the patio

5557830 a political odyssey the rise of american militarism and one mans fight to stop it
5557831 the people that i talked to about these tapes are extremely nervous there is a climate in america now which is punitive towards people who are suspected of disclosing information without authorization to journalists the approach of the bush administration is to punish people who come forward
5557832 what sibel revealed to us and has been revealing little by little since january is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the us to procure nuclear designs and parts for the aq khan network and it was done not through pakistani intelligence directly but through the turkish embassy
5557833 turkish businessmen who got the information and gave it to turkish military attaches who then turned it over to the isi and from there went on to the nuclear black market
5557834 now sibel tells us that high government officials inside those two departments defense and state were involved in this ring she has named them on her website at least she has not named them she has photographs of people other bloggers have named them
5557835 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy
5557836 the mindset of the american mainstream press does not allow certain ideas to easily filter through the idea that high ranking us officials might actually be facilitating this
5557837 they rarely look at the entire system being rotten not just one official here or there being rotten and they pat themselves on the back and when i say the entire system being rotten i mean congress that is enthralled to corporate backers and approving their aggressive foreign policy that enriches themselves and does nothing to secure the american people or the interests of most american people that is not even in the discussion in the mainstream press so this boston globe reporter was unable to conceive easily that a government official could have been nvolved
5557838 again and again you see journalists in this country who think that their job consists of nothing more than phoning the fbi press office to ask for a comment
5557839 the agents that joe lauria spoke with are very familiar with all the details of the case because i worked directly with them yes it is true that these sources are very nervous about speaking out because they fear the legal repercussions however they shouldnt have anything to fear because they know that it is illegal for the government to classify anything for the purpose of hiding criminality as ive been saying from the beginning congress needs to hold hearings and put us all under oath where we are protected so long as we tell the truth

5557902 if american courts cannot decide such fundamental questions as what is the nature of the income tax and which section of the internal revenue code requires the filing of an income tax return then it is obvious that the problem with this tax involves these basic questions since even the courts are split over these questions shouldnt we just scrap the whole thing since the condition which exists is incapable of repair
5557903 recent discoveries prove that you may be paying an income tax you dont owe
5557904 knowing the dynamics of our current situation and the historically proven consequence of inaction is sufficient motive we cannot defy the laws of physical economy nor any other natural law and expect to escape unscathed denying the historical record and physical law is comparable to denying that the sun comes up in the east therefore responsible people must act to correct the system or suffer epochal consequence proof that the sixteenth amendment was never ratified that ohio was never properly admitted to the union and that the original thirteenth amendment simply vanished has conceptual and political value the evidence demonstrates the scope of fraud the american people are confronted with the fact that the sixteenth amendment has little or nothing to do with the normal tax most people know as income tax speaks to the character and craft of those responsible for perpetrating the fraud

5557934 if they screw up in a building and they deliberately do things that are wrong in the building just to pocket money and people die because of it then people should be held accountable
5557935 if programs have a good record and serve a vital national purpose that the private sector cant they will receive continued funding but i will not subordinate my commitment to the american people to ensure their tax dollars are spent wisely to the demands of labor leaders looking to swell the ranks of federal government unions i will make every aspect of government purchases and performance transparent information on every step of contracts and grants will be posted on the internet in plain and simple english were not going to hide anything behind accounting tricks and bureaucratic doubletalk nor will i allow other procurement tricks that divert funds from national priorities i will expand the use of fixed price contracts to enforce discipline in the procurement process and ensure that clearly defined requirements are fulfilled realistic schedules are kept and costs dont exceed the promised price too often contractors underbid to buy into a market with little expectation of delivering on schedule and within budget at the same time the governments cost estimates are often unrealistic fixed price contracts based on realistic cost estimates with clear consistent requirements will ensure that the contractor pays for cost overruns not the taxpayers we must also limit sole source contracting and make cost discipline a priority using market competition to keep costs down and innovation up
5557936 the civil service has strayed from its reformist roots and has mutated into a no accountability zone where employment is treated as an entitlement good performance as an option and accountability as someone elses problem our current system isnt fair to the many good federal workers who do not receive recognition for commitment and excellence and must pick up the slack of those who arent doing their jobs we must identify excellence in civil service reward and reward it appropriately
5557937 within the next 10 years over 40 percent of the federal workforce will likely retire this is an opportunity to reorganize the entire federal workforce we can use this opportunity to make sure that government pay scales allow us to attract the finest public servants equip them with the newest technologies target replacements judiciously and change government to make it smaller less expensive better skilled and more dedicated to the national interest employees in the private sector know that if they dont do their job right they will lose their job competition and consequences are the driving force of excellence taxpayers deserve the same commitment to excellence from their employees there must be a new bargain with federal employees one that is worthy of the american people and mindful that public service is a privilege and a responsibility not a right
5557938 there are many thousands of dedicated civil servants that are dedicated to making this nation a better place to live they are not the cause of the publics disaffection there are many legitimate reasons however why the american public is frustrated with washington they see a government that seems to grow and grow without tangible benefits federal civil servants provide important and valuable services but there is no reason why they should not be as accountable for their job performance as workers in the private sector we owe this reform to the american taxpayers and to the many civil service employees who serve their nation admirably and with dedication
5557939 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5557940 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5557941 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5557942 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
5557943 we want the course to act as a vehicle to re engage them but we will be setting ground rules
5557944 we dont want to simply take them out of school and that is all they do there will be a clear understanding that this is an add on conditional on carrying out their normal school work
5557945 this qualification will be of use anywhere where people are trying to enthuse and inspire youngsters it will promote a can do attitude and give them a sense of achievement on which to build
5557946 it is up to individual headteachers if they think it would be appropriate for some pupils it may be that some pupils will respond but i would be skeptical
5557947 it is very much our policy that pupils who are persistently disruptive should be removed from class until they learn to behave and that is popular with teachers and parents alike
5557948 there have been various initiatives of this type and while it is maybe a bit unusual it may have a function
5557949 we got him the dog my mother in law called me and she knew i was close by so she had me go get him
5557950 hes just scared thats all but no harm done the house is fine but the one across the street is gone hers is ok
5557951 my house is directly underneath the first house that burned i am looking out my window at eight firemen trying to extinguish that house it is right next door to one of the houses that was damaged in the 2004 fire the next three lots are completely ash flanked by the first houses still burning structure and another house with a completely collapsed roof the firemen are still trying to douse the hill to make sure there are no flare ups there is an irrigation ditch that runs through the middle of the hill and the fire burned all the way down to it whoever put that ditch there saved many houses on melody lane including mine this is one of the most unbelievable sights i have seen
5557952 i wish they would recommend people would clean up their sage brush in their backyard
5557953 a garden hose like that doesnt do anything against a fire like that
5557954 my shirt caught on fire that year thats how hot it was i learned my lesson from that year
5557955 it just happened so fast i was at the fifth house before anyone was on the street
5557956 i was losing my shorts i was running so fast
5557957 this is kind of a horrible situation since we lived here four years ago when we watched it all go up in flames
5557958 when a fire starts two to three houses are already burned by the time the fire crews get here
5557959 people were running around with kids and pets kicking in doors
5557960 we can only mark up 15 percent of operation costs the general assembly has told us how to run it and make a profit for the county
5557961 its really found money all they do is get the check and cash it said omalley
5557962 if people think that they need to be reformed or this layer of government needs to be done away with im open to that
5557963 our neighbors from across the street two or three houses down started kicking our door and yelling at us to get out get out
5557964 if it wasnt for our neighbors we would have probably still been in there
5557965 we just bought a lot of stuff recently and its gone
5557966 i thought it was safe because it was a couple of blocks down but then i saw embers
5557967 we have the same kind of roof and we were afraid with all the ash coming in and the wind the whole side of the duplex caught on fire
5557968 i just started grabbing stuff important stuff pictures computer things that cant be replaced
5557969 we have lived here for many years and this is the closest its come to our house
5557970 we would have sold our house five years ago but the market bottomed out
5557971 we would not have made enough money now with the fire its going to ruin everything
5557972 this delay in russian withdrawal appears to be a tactical maneuver the russians will leave when it is advantageous for them to do so and
5557973 two penetrating gun wounds were found the first one wasnt lethal in the leg the second was in the head traces of explosive gas burns near the entry hall are the evidence of short range firing
5557974 what amazes me is that the controllers of the media still havent realized that the old methods of lies and propaganda no longer work the internet gives humanity a collective memory and consciousness that exists outside governmental and corporate control and the average life span of a media lie is measured with an egg timer these days
5557975 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5557976 clearly quite tight and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders cost of funds in the market
5557977 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5557978 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5557979 all they are really saying here is that if they dont move towards less restrictive conditions the risk of a deeper or more persistent slowing of the economy would increase
5557980 they dont want that which is an argument to cut rates but by the same token the language is not strong enough to suggest they are heading towards a 50 basis point cut next month

5558001 consolidated comparable store growth for the first seven weeks of trading in 2008 09 was 19 2 per cent continuing our impressive comp store growth of the previous year mr uechtritz said
5558002 as this is only seven weeks and we have the all important christmas trading period ahead of us we maintain our previous sales guidance of circa 2 35 billion or a 28 per cent increase on 2007 08
5558003 we are extremely pleased with this very strong result having traded well during what is considered to be the weakest retail climate for many years mr uechtritz said
5558004 whilst the retail outlook is less certain than at previous reporting dates jb has proven to be resilient with home entertainment becoming more of a staple category as consumers keep up with technology

5558010 and id like to start with a victory to avoid breaking the world cup streak
5558011 when i started my national team adventure four years ago there was a team and a group to build from nothing

5558020 if we are going to succeed in the uptake of broadband and the extension of broadband it has to be effective technology but affordable
5558021 and it needs to be accessible the best way of doing that is working with the local communities and all the people that make up the local communities
5558022 it quantifies a direct benefit to yorke peninsula of 21 4 million over five years
5558023 what youll see is youll have 25 or 30 people lining up outside an affordable housing estate where there may be two or three residences for rent so itll be a bidding war basically

5558035 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share

5558040 melville and springsteen alert us to the energy of winter we all know of this the minds winter no leaves now hide the nakedness of the branches we have the feeling that there is room for almost anything to fill this wintry void something surely is going to happen out there in the vast spaces drained of all meaning once we accept these seasons of mental winter as inevitable parts of our life indeed once we affirm them as essential elements of existence then the paradox comes truly alive we actually feel in the midst of our sorrow something akin to joy we suddenly feel better not blissfully happy but tragically joyful we die into life
5558041 a lot of our exports go actually to america both commodity export but even more importantly our services they import and these have slackened
5558042 there are some indications clear indications that the american growth slack would hit india too and you know our growth rate has come down a bit and we have to see how much further it comes down
5558043 on the other hand we are not thoroughly dependent on it we should try to see what we can do to overcome that
5558044 i have never been a crystal gazer well i think it goes away in less than two or three years i will be very surprised if it goes on for more than four five years
5558045 if you want to make democracy work you have to make sure that not only the government but the opposition also concentrates on identified major issues
5558046 the growth is a non thought growth is not a formula
5558047 so the issue of democracy is quite central to issue of growth
5558048 this puts a lot of money in government hand so the question is what its priority should be
5558049 all these relate to each other this is one way of increasing the sharing of growth the other way is growth generates income in fact it generates more than proportionate income for the public sector for the government revenue
5558050 come to the reserve before the auction she proclaimed and we will discuss it further
5558051 you cant hit a three run home run with nobody on base
5558052 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5558053 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5558054 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5558055 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5558056 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5558057 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5558058 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5558059 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5558060 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5558061 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5558062 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5558063 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5558064 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5558065 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5558066 hey a holes that said i was appearing at a strip club last week dead wrong i was no where near nor will i ever be doing a signing and or appearance in a strip club i actually found it quite funny while i was at home updating my myspace all of these so called news sites saying i would be there apparently tmz even wanted to talk about it so crazy so for anybody that actually went there to see me and didnt i apologize for the lack of responsibility on many peoples parts if i had known about this sooner i could have tried to fix it before anyone went there to see me but alas i was alerted to it probably the same time as you guys so anyone who went to that place to see me sorry you got duped ill be sure to make another app soon in ny to make up for that
5558067 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5558068 we also found that low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5558069 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5558070 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5558071 signs of not getting enough sleep or sleeping poorly include consistently taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep awakening more than a few times or for long periods each night feeling sleepy during the day or having trouble concentrating at school or at work

5558080 aye eeeeeeeeeeeeee yyyyyaaaaaaaiiiiiii e ayeeee need tieeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeee yyyyyyyaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiii e ime
5558081 im with the coaches with the training staff doing everything theyre telling me to do probably a little more pushing myself im going to do everything in my power to make sure im prepared
5558082 i dont want to say more than i do at practice but it is a lot of individual work a lot of work to make sure my leg is not getting fatigued make sure conditioning wise its strong i can do different drills and everything
5558083 thats why i come out of the hutson center sweating so hard its a lot of work
5558084 i didnt pull it or anything like that i felt it tighten up but its not severe
5558085 im feeling good and i know theyre being careful with me the biggest thing is to make sure i dont feel it at any point and its not a recurring thing
5558086 all the guys that are out tested better today than they did last week so thats a positive
5558087 but hes not ready to go to practice once he can complete the medical test then ill practice him i was hopeful he could go this week but hes not quite ready
5558088 its new to me not being out on the field but im slowly learning how to be smart and take care of your body and figure things out ill be all right
5558089 thats why we have the doctors and trainers around here that do a good job whether players like it or not they are pretty conservative with what they are doing and they want to take care of players i respect that and i respect our doctors decision and what the trainers tell us
5558090 its tough not being out there with your teammates but i know if i want to get to where i have to be its something that i have to do
5558091 the thing you really want to do is go back out the second half and try to fix the things you made mistakes on in the first half but thats the nature of the preseason
5558092 we watched the film and made the corrections and now were going to move forward hopefully well have a better performance this week against denver
5558093 were going to definitely game plan a little bit more for these guys more than we have in the first two games
5558094 this should be a good opportunity for us to figure out what we are made of and kind of what our identity is going to be
5558095 weve been bouncing around moving around changing lineups since we have been here
5558096 its something we are used to and we just know that we are expected to come out and do our jobs and play well and be accountable every week
5558097 obviously it was embarrassing the way we played luckily for us it was only the preseason hopefully we can learn from it see what not to do in a football game and then move on and get better
5558098 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point

5558102 qw really like me meh but i really dun like him lor actually i like the three ncc land boys in our class wonder why
5558103 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5558104 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5558105 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5558106 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5558107 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5558108 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5558109 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5558110 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5558111 i have to talk i have something i must confess to you
5558112 its all right everythings all right go to sleep now
5558113 no no i must die in peace john i had affairs with your brother your best friend and your father

5558115 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5558116 once the taxpayers are provided with more information they will be more able to engage in the debate over how their money should be spent
5558117 most people know very little about how their school budget is spent say or any number of things in the state budget
5558118 playing such a high profile role for mr giuliani in a new york contest many of the conservatives he has become close to on the mccain campaign could prove toxic among new york voters
5558119 america has been running a large external deficit for some time and this deficit is increasingly being financed by the sale of debt to foreign governments
5558120 the roughly 35 billion that sovereign wealth funds put into u s financial institutions is dwarfed by foreign central banks purchase of treasury and agency bonds totaling 500 to 600 billion and many of the governments buying this debt are either not allies or do not share all of americas values
5558121 throw in the fact that high oil prices have yet to put a dent in chinas current account surplus or the accumulation of chinas foreign assets and the shift in financial power away from democratic governments is even more pronounced
5558122 the fact that all these countries are holding our debt is because its a good investment
5558123 i would be worried if we had to go hat in hand to sell our debt like getting a mortgage but instead judging by our credit rating people and governments around the world are delighted to lend to us
5558124 spending has been trending up in foreign countries so their surpluses could fall quite significantly
5558125 taiwan is supported by the u s and can get whatever they want
5558126 when bear stearns moved to a new building several years ago tighter security regulations killed our old stairwell mincha minyan but after a few months i was able to get the conference room next to my office word spread and we started attracting outsiders from nearby firms after a few weeks i received a call from bears human resources department i was told there were issues with outsiders coming to a secure floor
5558127 it turns out there is a law requiring companies to provide employees with reasonable accommodation to prayer so while the company did not want an official bear stearns minyan they agreed to give me a room every day for prayer for the andy neff meeting to which i could invite some of my friends to enable me to have a minyan twenty to 30 people regularly attended the service
5558128 ironically though bear stearns is gone the minyan lives on roughly one third of the attendees were from j p morgan which owned three buildings adjacent to our headquarters we simply transferred management of the minyan to j p morgan

5558131 gentlemen the rules have changed from now on there will be no more bargaining over prisoners or hostages there will be a fixed price and it will be one of absolute parity for one dead israeli you get one dead arab for one live israeli one live arab for any multiple of that you get the multiple no more and no less
5558132 there is nothing to negotiate about you know the price were ready to pay if you want us to pay it we will meanwhile just to make sure you realize that you dont have forever we intend to imprison one more member of your organization for every week that it takes you to decide
5558133 for the sake of repairing the world one must never ransom hostages for more than their worth
5558134 he left like nixon did under pressure of probable impeachment
5558135 then again he is also the first pakistani leader to leave on his own without being hanged assassinated or deposed by the military for pakistan that is a certain step forward
5558136 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5558137 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5558138 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5558139 departure is a loss for the u s because the civilian government will not do as good a job against terrorism
5558140 what we needed in pakistan is someone to stand with us and musharraf did just that
5558141 deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
5558142 regardless of who is in power next year the legislature is going to have to look at increasing taxes
5558143 if the democrats are in power they will try to tax wealthier people if the senate democrats take over we hope they will be true to those time honored views
5558144 this is a responsible approach to not only dealing with the fact that we have a looming budget crisis but giving the greatest amount of relief to those who most need it low and middle income new yorkers
5558145 it has been clear from the beginning and from everything the speaker has said over the past year that they are much more interested in raising taxes instead of reducing the budget
5558146 digital storytelling is the practice of combining narrative with digital content including images sound and video to create a short movie typically with a strong emotional component sophisticated digital stories can be interactive movies that include highly produced audio and visual effects but a set of slides with corresponding narration or music constitutes a basic digital story digital stories can be instructional persuasive historical or reflective the resources available to incorporate into a digital story are virtually limitless giving the storyteller enormous creative latitude some learning theorists believe that as a pedagogical technique storytelling can be effectively applied to nearly any subject constructing a narrative and communicating it effectively require the storyteller to think carefully about the topic and consider the audiences perspective
5558147 multiliteracies is an approach to literacy which focuses on variations in language use according to different social and cultural situations and the intrinsic multimodality of communications particularly in the context of todays new media
5558148 it is no longer enough for literacy teaching to focus solely on the rules of standard forms of the national language rather the business of communication and representation of meaning today increasingly requires that learners are able figure out differences in patterns of meaning from one context to another these differences are the consequence of any number of factors including culture gender life experience subject matter social or subject domain and the like every meaning exchange is cross cultural to a certain degree
5558149 buyers nowadays are more receptive to all eras of british painting its a very fun crowd at the gleneagles
5558150 the colorists spent time in paris and got to know the techniques of matisse and monet their paintings have huge appeal to the international set
5558151 the painting is almost atypical of a scottish colorist in that he is experimenting with abstraction
5558152 its pretty clear to me that he must have known churchill in north africa
5558153 here we see the american novelist mary borden at her beautiful home in buckinghamshire
5558154 lord rosebury admiral fleming the duke of buccleuch and lord charles hope with their respective caddies at north berwick
5558155 lord rosebury was one of the more notable gents from that period
5558156 the painting really captures what it was like to play golf in those days
5558157 its important for young guys to know they can come up big in those situations
5558158 hes been working with our hitting coach don long and is getting better he worked to get a good pitch to hit im sure it was a nice boost to get that
5558159 if we hang around long enough we have the ability to get it done
5558160 we took advantage of a couple of mistakes to push across some runs
5558161 the war the economy a lot of people losing their homes

5558163 were hearing from more and more democrats that theyre just not going to vote for obama
5558164 some of the folks who were with hillary came right over others it took a little while still a few we need to work on
5558165 he needs to be out here more we hope to see more of him
5558166 believe what they hear from him and not what someones saying
5558167 one of the things we found in the poll even under a large number of democratic voters is that theres a concern about obamas experience
5558168 hes this hip cool guy that may feed into this concern that voters have about him
5558169 it looks like those two dogs are fighting i think ill go hump the one thats losing
5558170 whilst its not ideal that we go away with a limited preparation its a fantastic opportunity for this group to begin our super 14 2009 preparations
5558171 one of the beauties of this tour is we can take players out of their comfort zone in terms of the travel in terms of the short schedule between games so guys will really have to be vigilant with their preparation
5558172 you dont get any easy games in france so theyll provide us with a different style of opposition to the irish
5558173 were hopeful that well give a good account of ourselves in all four matches

5558176 its a travesty and its really a shame we should throw out the ordinance we have now as far away as possible
5558177 we posted excellent growth in all countries business development in the first half of 2008 showed that boehringer ingelheim remains on a healthy growth path and the company continues to outpace the pharma market
5558178 hes head and shoulders above where he was last year at this time and im not just saying that because you asked the question im saying it because its the truth
5558179 hes much more dependable and he looks more like a receiver that knows how to be a receiver not just like a guy who runs fast
5558180 as one of the largest us suppliers of influenza vaccine providing large quantities of fluvirin early in the season supports public health efforts to vaccinate as many people as early as possible this upcoming influenza season
5558181 novartis is committed to delivering high quality influenza vaccine to help protect more people against this potentially serious and contagious disease
5558182 novartis has made a concerted effort to manufacture and deliver a vaccine that includes these three new strains in the most efficient manner
5558183 despite the new composition novartis made sure we were able to deliver a timely and robust supply of influenza vaccine this year

5558192 has been included and the argument is therefore now a valid one
5558193 you claim that this man is innocent but you cannot be trusted since you are a criminal as well
5558194 paula says the umpire made the correct call but this cant be true because paula was doing more important things than watching the game

5558218 and we made some decisions with our heart instead of our head that winter to bring just about everybody back but they became older and less motivated and everything fell apart
5558219 in 1999 the other team had to lose the game because we cant win it thats a terrible thing for a manager to be saying that was the aura surrounding that team

5558306 shopping why we love it and how retailers can create the ultimate customer experience
5558307 but in 2006 the mens jewelry market reached a 10 percent share of the market so it cant be ignored any longer by jewelry marketers and retailers
5558308 our findings suggest that men are putting their experience as knowledgeable consumers of womens jewelry to work in making fine jewelry purchases for themselves
5558309 now that many men are abandoning business casual for more formal business attire they are interested in accenting their wardrobes not only with a fine watch but gold rings and cufflinks and as well
5558310 jewelry shoppers in their search for higher quality merchandise and more fashion forward designs found that the service and expert advice available in jewelry stores was exactly what they needed they were willing to trade up for service and experiences that they couldnt find in discount and warehouse retailers

5558322 a director whose feel for small time scrappy wage earners possibly came from his own cooperative energetic function in the movie industry walsh made a mistake when he misread his own strengths he was insistently touted as a flexible master of swift moving adventure epics and abandoned stagnant suspended scenes of truckers resting up at an all night roadside caf before tackling the next leg of the truck route of a bedraggled dame gladys george consoling a deposed rackets chief mourning his lowered status over beer after beer of the petty racy banter passed around with waitresses chorus girls and hat checkers
5558323 christ its not bad it reminds me of my last movie
5558324 the position of laurel and hardy in their scene was revolutionary it was dispersed theyre always viewed in relation to american suburbanism possessionism commodityism or copism thats very different from chaplin or keaton in that theyre rather small items in a space and the space is political social prestige to get the money and be accepted in society and the viewpoint never loses that distance on them instead of being virtuosos commanding space the way chaplin is dissolving space around them the thing that intrigues me about laurel and hardy is that theyre sort of lost in the frame they dont work it to their advantage either aesthetically or egoistically thats whats so exciting about a duras or rivette movie theres a great deal of reality and truth and its magic you forget the idea of a linear construction into a story or into an event the edge of the frame is where art is today thats a big statement but thats where the fun is not only the edge of the frame the edge of the soundtrack not like bernard herrmanns taxi driver idea in which youre inside the movie theres nowhere to go its like a bowling alley
5558325 la r gion centrale looks at landscape from a viewpoint it hasnt been looked at before so that its completely primordial like seeing the world for the first time its a whole movie caught up in a kind of movement that envelops the whole movie in a movie a scene is usually just a fraction of the event a movement is just a fraction of it in this movie movement takes over the whole screen the whole movie its seeing things inside the cyclical movement of feeling or existence the back and forth movement the slow zoom movement its being caught up in a whole force of vision straub refuses to believe that you can have any number of camera angles in a movie that is the fantasy thats what godard arrived at well why am i putting the camera out there why are those people acting that way its a myth it doesnt make sense the logic is wrong so he brought the film down to one shot and now hes into video hes given up the idea of a movie screen image totally which is ok i think hes giving up the whole technique of movies hes gone into this new process video making because he thinks it would be phony to go back and do works like masculin f minin where camera position color whatever are arbitrary if you can have it that way why cant you have it a million ways why is the camera outside the window if it cant be outside the window i think thats a believable question

5558369 while the death penalty continues to be used in india there remains a danger that it will be used disproportionately against ethnic minorities the poor or other disadvantaged groups there is only one way to ensure such inequalities in the administration of justice do not occur the complete abolition of the death penalty
5558370 india stands at a crossroads it can choose to join the global trend towards a moratorium on the death penalty as adopted by the un general assembly last year it will also then join 27 countries in the asia pacific region which have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice

5558379 therefore you should not be a judge in the same court you should opt to be transferred to some other court where a close relative is not practising
5558380 that instances have come that a relation of a judge having joined only three four years in the practise suddenly his briefs are huge in number so that is what it is under scrutiny because he takes advantage of his position

5558439 random house made the decision to cancel its us publication of the novel
5558440 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5558441 firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some

5558446 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5558447 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group

5558451 some people are talking about a 50 basis point cut this would put a bit of a dampener on that which is a positive for the aussie dollar
5558452 it doesnt have the degree of urgency which would suggest that the reserve bank sees itself about to embark on a 50 basis point move or a huge reduction in interest rates by the end of the year
5558453 that in turn is pretty supportive for the australian dollar in the short term
5558454 these condition are expected to lead to higher levels of virus activity and greater exposure of humans to the viruses prof dunstan said
5558455 however australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the ross river barmah forrest kunjin japanese encephalitis murray valley encephalitis and dengue viruses prof dunstan said
5558456 the risk of emergence of transfusion transmissible infectious diseases emphasises the need for countries to work together to help each other maintain their blood supplies during epidemics and pandemics the researchers wrote in their report
5558457 this is particularly important should a major infectious disease pandemic occur in different countries at different times

5558464 but it will help to work with a team thats already in place while trying to fill in for todd and take some of the pressure off phil
5558465 it also helps to have the facilities that dsr has including the supercharger dynos clutch dynos and all the resources the dsr crew chiefs are all people i have known for a long time and that makes working with them pretty easy

5558481 today we concentrated on front tyres with michelin who provided us with some different compounds and rubber to try we found some improvement with regards to the wear of the tyre which was one of the biggest problems during the weekend but there is still a lot of work to do tomorrow we will shift focus to the rear tyre and we hope we can make the most of the day so that we can go to misano in better shape and with more confidence

5558625 you take a sip close your eyes and make a wish your wish will come true in 21 days
5558626 we are experiencing history here as these tea estates will not perhaps survive for more than 50 years
5558627 our guests get to see the entire process from plucking to packing which very few places in the world can offer
5558628 it is a great promotional exercise for darjeeling tea as it is a unique experience that tea gardens can offer

5558638 we all know that mrsa is an important if not the most important hospital acquired and community acquired organism
5558639 it will always be challenging to stay ahead of the novel way that this organism is changing
5558640 the cdc has consistently understated the size of this problem and has underestimated the cost
5558641 if the vaccine works it will be an enormous lifesaver
5558642 patients can get infections in the breastbone that sometimes require prolonged antibiotics and prolonged hospitalization so if this is successful it would be a tremendous advance

5558649 we have a bird hotline for people to call and we havent gotten any calls about it
5558650 the prevalence is somewhat surprising but the fact that it has occurred is not
5558651 we live in a world of migration of all sorts of animals birds and humans
5558652 we had an example recently of multi drug resistant tb i see all of it as a continuum as birds migrating on wings to humans migrating in airplanes

5558657 oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say
5558658 because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books
5558659 the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffes works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time
5558660 how long do you think we have been running it from tetbury miss morland
5558661 what do you think of my gig miss morland a neat one is not it well hung town built i have not had it a month it was built for a christchurch man a friend of mine a very good sort of fellow he ran it a few weeks till i believe it was convenient to have done with it i happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind though i had pretty well determined on a curricle too but i chanced to meet him on magdalen bridge as he was driving into oxford last term ah thorpe said he do you happen to want such a little thing as this it is a capital one of the kind but i am cursed tired of it oh d said i i am your man what do you ask and how much do you think he did miss morland
5558662 curricle hung you see seat trunk sword case splashing board lamps silver moulding all you see complete the iron work as good as new or better he asked fifty guineas i closed with him directly threw down the money and the carriage was mine
5558663 i know so little of such things that i cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear
5558664 to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season ill lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expences of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something
5558665 i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then
5558666 but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it
5558667 that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here
5558668 yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in but however so it is your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them
5558669 mike is one of the greatest up and coming talents in the united states today
5558670 mike has a great feel for the dallara chassis and communicates well with the crew on what adjustments need to be made after a session is completed he is a real asset to the team
5558671 with mike being an accomplished road racer it allows him to compete with the european drivers and our expectations are set on a high finish for both days of competition we are not running for the championship so we are using the last three races as a test to help us prepare for the 2009 season

5558685 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5558686 they had guys in 68 that didnt make the team that could whip this team im not taking anything away from these young athletes but i dont think they have anywhere near the depth we had
5558687 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5558688 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend
5558689 i had a lot of people in my corner encouraging me and looking after me
5558690 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5558691 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5558692 i dont think it would be productive for our football team
5558693 theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right
5558694 i think that we are just ambling along and making our way at present i think we are drifting a bit i don t really see any clear signals in terms of going in a certain direction and certainly this whole question of empowering people and creating a situation in which bahamians feel that this is their country and they have a say in what happens i don t see that happening
5558695 it bahamianization policy will be a way of life accepted by most people and one that most people can buy into and work towards right now most bahamians feel like they don t have any say in what happens
5558696 we need to have a policy that really brings more people into the decision making and find ways of doing it we really need some real planning and we are not really good at planning as a nation
5558697 we should be able to say that in 10 years time this is where we want to be a country must have some idea of where it is headed and in today s bahamas we seem to be headed from one budget speech to the next interspersed with some news about this foreigner or the next foreigner coming in to spend some money or bring some plan
5558698 where is the national plan and where does all of this fit into a national plan
5558699 what was bahamian is largely influenced by external forces and external factors
5558700 to add insult to injury we live in a country where the economy is determined by outsiders outsiders decide the fate of bahamians unfortunately as a country we don t seem to be interested in reversing that trend but i would hate to be in a bahamas that puts a curtain around the whole bahamas that stops the outsiders from coming in but i would be happier if we were living in a situation where we were able to determine our destiny in a far greater degree than we presently are
5558701 in terms of morality my recollection of my teenage days and earlier there was a lot of immorality around and we had the same teenage pregnancy problems and illegitimacy was real although the present figures are higher now than they were then but fundamentally we are different now because our assumptions are different
5558702 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5558703 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5558704 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5558705 if i get extradited the justice and peace process ends there because the foot soldiers do not know anything
5558706 if i go then the story of the self defense forces is incomplete
5558707 i see this with huge and profound concern because it could leave many cases in impunity
5558708 by the hastiness to resolve one problem and that problem is drug trafficking
5558709 but it wasnt because justice and peace was not providing results
5558710 tengo veinte a os en monterrey quiz ya agarr la tonada de all pero soy de aqu y sigo siendo de aqu de temaca

5558723 i want you to make room in your day today for us to have
5558724 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5558725 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5558726 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5558727 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5558728 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5558729 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5558730 if the only tool you have is a hammer than every problem is a nail
5558731 a strong call to action is more important than clicks for local business
5558732 you can own a large percentage of a google search results page with some clever video optimization
5558733 a way to keep content and the ad very pure users are very interested in the ad content itself
5558734 the way users interact in video search is more of a search and browse mentality whereas in regular search it is more of a search and refine mentality
5558735 its the text search engine that brings visitors to the site and then how they merchandise the content on the site determines which content wins and which content loses
5558736 its a wonderful day for jamaica and you have done us proud it was a stunning performance and we are so proud of you

5558742 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5558743 after seeing what happened in new orleans and that area i think early evacuation of visitors is important for safety especially in the keys where we only have one road out lives are more important than revenue
5558744 our performances in track and field have spoken for themselves over the years now we must take things one step further and become a regular fixture on the annual athletics calendar we have secured buy in from the senior stakeholders in jamaican track and field and we are working hard to make this happen
5558745 we have seen here in beijing the power of brand jamaica at work there is no more exciting word in beijing than jamaica at the moment we have seen how the locals line up for photo opportunities with anybody in a jamaica shirt we have seen how they have sought after our pins and other memorabilia jamaica is the buzz word right now and we plan to fully exploit the brand jamaica concept with sports at the centre
5558746 i just want to go out there and leave it all on the track and just hope for the best
5558747 after the 100 i had little time for celebration all i have done is a big sleep and some relaxation
5558748 it was not all that easy today but im going to go out there all the time do my thing and show the world that im probably the best

5558772 this is a tremendous opportunity for the individual students as well as the entire bahamas because we will be enriched by the talent and skill that this course will provide
5558773 these scholarships will certainly add to the talent that we have in the bahamas and the training being provided will benefit both bahamians and chinese citizens
5558774 a foreign language is a vehicle for cultural interaction it is a means of communication by which ideas and aspirations are shared among different peoples it is an essential tool for enhancing friendship and mutual understanding

5558819 really when you look at all the data jordan steffy has earned the spot he was ahead in almost every category
5558820 we rotated the quarterbacks with all the teams for the last nine practices so everybody had an equal shot with every team
5558821 i think theres a credibility thing here if you dont reward kids for practicing well then i dont know what you can base your decision on what made it hard is that chris played well in the games but based on not only fall practice but i even went back to spring practices steffy was far and away ahead in all the statistics

5558841 but thats a 2009 10 story no immediate bounce is expected and this is bad news particularly for those searching for affordable rental housing
5558842 we expect the recovery to be modest given the lack of skilled labour in the industry and the long road ahead in lifting housing affordability to reasonable levels
5558843 i have nothing against morton businesses but if my wife wants a bottle of wine why should she have to drive to east peoria

5558855 tiene la tarea de presentar a los y mejores ciudadanos militantes o ex militantes del pan o incluso a candidatos ciudadanos que no est n en las filas del partido

5558860 wir registrieren mit genugtuung dass auch die verantwortlichen politiker aufwachen wenn es gelingt in allen bundesl ndern f r unseren vorschlag mitstreiter zu gewinnen k nnen wir ein st ck mehr gerechtigkeit herstellen es kann nicht sein dass jeder transportunternehmer der einen schwertransport von der polizei begleiten l sst und steuern zahlt daf r zur kasse gebeten wird aber gleichzeitig im profifu ball millionen verdient werden auf dem r cken der allgemeinheit und der polizei
5558861 die berufung des dfb auf den verfassungsrechtlichen schutzauftrag der polizei berzeugt nicht es gibt n mlich kein grundrecht auf fu ball dagegen m ssen polizeiliche ma nahmen bei demonstrationen nat rlich kostenfrei bleiben denn hier wird in der tat ein grundrecht wahrgenommen das ist eben der unterschied

5558896 no record will ever go gold again cause theres this thing called limewire
5558897 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile
5558898 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge
5558899 the operating environment during the next 12 months is expected to be the most challenging the virgin blue group which now comprises virgin blue pacific blue polynesian blue and vaustralia has experienced to date
5558900 with fuel costs at never before seen record highs for much of the year and airlines around the world struggling to cope this result is a testament to our team and business model
5558901 we have implemented a range of measures in recent months to mitigate the impact of increased fuel costs
5558902 we will continue to closely monitor the operating environment and take whatever actions are necessary to see our way through what is expected to be a challenging period
5558903 i heard some rumours from others about the possibility of the srw going from a racetrack to a training track
5558904 we cant let that happen and im sure the honourable minister provincial treasurer wes sheridan wont let it happen its a major industry here in summerside it creates jobs and economic spin offs it helps with tourism
5558905 we are working on our responsible gaming strategy and once thats done we can turn our attention to summerside
5558906 he said im a pretty confident guy i think youll get through when he said that i was pretty convinced id get through now im off to the semifinal and hopefully the final the day after
5558907 if they had made me run in the first row of the crowd i would have done that too
5558908 it certainly looks like a j probably wont be here
5558909 i mean just put the numbers together and you can figure that one out real easy
5558910 i dont really care about the free market and money and things like that
5558911 i havent made up my mind i havent talked to my family i havent talked to anyone about it i dont want to be distracted with anything right now
5558912 and im finally winning some ball games and helping this team out for the first time in three years thats just the way i look at it
5558913 certainly we would like to have scored a higher grade than a d he said
5558914 we have made good strides in helping islanders make their homes more energy efficient said collier
5558915 i look forward to seeing what our grade is in the future
5558916 im across the country on a regular basis looking at various issues and seeing whos at the table ontario quebec manitoba b c consistently there consistently there
5558917 we need to see more participation from some of the other provinces
5558918 n o vos sobreveio tenta o que n o fosse humana
5558919 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5558920 clearly quite tight and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders cost of funds in the market
5558921 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5558922 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5558923 all they are really saying here is that if they dont move towards less restrictive conditions the risk of a deeper or more persistent slowing of the economy would increase
5558924 they dont want that which is an argument to cut rates but by the same token the language is not strong enough to suggest they are heading towards a 50 basis point cut next month
5558925 i think it is consistent with 25 basis points next month
5558926 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5558927 theyre afraid that they arent going to have money to buy oil theyre afraid they might have to move out of their homes and rent an apartment
5558928 im hoping to get as much as 20 000 or 30 000 maybe more than that
5558929 son varios los rivales que me han retado y en una semana definir quien ser el elegido
5558930 hay muchos oponentes en la lista incluido manny pacquiao quien sigue siendo un viable contendiente pues las negociaciones no han terminado
5558931 he recibido muchos retos y margarito tambi n est incluido as como sergio mora quien creo junto a pacquiao son los m s cercanos a mi decisi n
5558932 si alguien me preguntara a quien enfrentar a de margarito o paul williams responder a que williams que venci a margarito que reclama ser el mejor welter tras vencer a miguel cotto pero para terminar con esos dimes y diretes creo que williams y margarito deben acabar con lo que iniciaron en una pelea de revancha ese es el pleito l gico para ellos
5558933 richard schaefer tiene la orden de buscarme la pelea m s lucrativa en t rminos econ micos mientras que en lo deportivo yo me encargar de definir el rival de entre todos los que me retan y que est n haciendo fila
5558934 ahorita ando en 150 libras y estoy seguro que puedo dar el welter de no darse la pelea contra pacquiao en 147 libras existe la alternativa de pelearle a sergio mora en una cita hist rica por todo lo que encierra su trayectoria mora y la m a en un escenario local como el dodger stadium o el coliseo de los angeles
5558935 i have complete confidence in you and the fact that kindergarten wasnt invented this year i know this isnt your first time but its mine
5558936 at present one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured
5558937 a further 44 walking wounded patients have been taken to the medical centre at alton towers and are being treated by medical staff and doctors
5558938 random house made the decision to cancel its us publication of the novel
5558939 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5558940 firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some
5558941 however we must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided not to go forward with this publication out of concerns for the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
5558942 womens empowerment never a popular theme among fundamentalists of any faith
5558943 given the respect with which i treat the muslim prophet however i never expected to be killed because of it i still dont
5558944 it just doesnt seem to be fair that this is how we react but that is what we seem to be doing
5558945 its incredibly hard to find one act that would please all of our students its just not possible we try to widen the range as much as we can because we want everyone to come
5558946 its fallfest i hear its one of the big events of the year and i just came to hang out and see the bands
5558947 i plan to just have a good time spending time with friends that i havent see for a while
5558948 i cant wait to see daughtry im actually going to see him tomorrow night too
5558949 frenetic three minute routines filled with tricks performed too fast to make sense of them
5558950 i compare this the talks to a shattered glass it would be very difficult to put the pieces together
5558951 we have already freed the towns we are on pursuit operations we will not stop until we catch up with them
5558952 they killed innocent defenceless civilians people are traumatized we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5558953 will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace
5558954 this is a consequence of the non movement of the peace process
5558955 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5558956 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5558957 importantly the sotg located him positively identified him and when it was confirmed that there were no non combatant afghans nearby accurately targeted him for the successful isaf international security assistance force airstrike
5558958 our goal by the end of september to have most of virginia online and hopefully by the end of the year to have at least the large cities in the u s online weve got subcontractors out adding data as we speak
5558959 just heard about this today word of mouth spreads fast
5558960 if i get in i get in if not its worth a try anyway
5558961 i do think theres sort of an underground community of supporters for the democratic party of for more liberal causes so i think this is a good for him to make a showing and win some of the swing vote over to him as well
5558962 a lot of old standards and what weve done for years and years has just continued to lead us down a certain path and maybe hes got a better idea
5558963 i would like for him to lower these gas prices
5558964 it is because of liu xiang it is a sad day for china the biggest news in our country
5558965 but he and yao ming are our most famous ones
5558966 liu xiang is a great athlete he stands the pressure no other athletes can simply stand
5558967 i think the chinese people will understand the situation and will encourage him to come back to the track
5558968 but i think its closing down along with another tall etc in walnut creek i may end up having to drive all the way to pasadena to shop or use mail order
5558969 if you make the final anything can happen i had a far throw on my first attempt and nobody else stepped up i won a gold medal
5558970 i had told some people before this competition brown trafton said
5558971 people look over the old heads basically the fans who are over 25
5558972 people look over them i dont thats my wheelhouse my true fans are probably 10 years younger than me 10 years older than me that world doesnt buy a lot of records now but its my job to get them to check for what im doing
5558973 my record is catering towards the mature hip hop fan
5558974 the kids might be able to get with it but it aint just playing it aint just partying its reality to me this album
5558975 going independent in 2006 really re energized me it rejuvenated me and my feelings for the game
5558976 being on major record labels is for the birds it sucks all your energy out because the good ideas you come up with a lot of times they dont wanna do it especially on the promotional tip they follow these same ancient formulas to sell a record you gotta be creative in 2008 to sell a record thats the first thing when i started doing it independent it gave me my swagger back and made me feel like i was doing hip hop and not just doing records for somebody i just went back to the essence and stopped worrying about the hip hop fans and started worrying about ice cube fans
5558977 i wanna take it back to the real hip hop
5558978 it takes a nation of millions to hold us back by public enemy is one of the records i cherish i love i wanted to flip that and put the emphasis more on us and our community on what were doing to hold us back i also wanted to talk about whats going on in the world and how i feel about it and what im ready to do its not a game people playing hip hop like its a game lets get back to talking about what people going through so we can solve some of these issues
5558979 hes basically asking his shooter why me why you pick me out of all this it goes to random violence people kill people they dont know i wanted somebody soulful on the hook to make you really feel what you trying to say musiq im a fan of his i like his voice i like his vibe he always keeps that soul in it he was a perfect pick why me is gonna be the next video i havent done a song like this kinda since dead homiez which was on my kill at will album im looking forward to people hearing this song its one of the strongest songs on the album
5558980 weve established a good relationship with jeezy because hes also in a movie i wrote called janky promoters
5558981 me and mike epps play two shady rap concert promoters we bring jeezy to town and dont have enough money to pay him we kinda got close doing the movie jeezy was like yo i want you to do a record on my album i was like i want you to do a record on mine we exchanged songs and concepts and made it happen we got a heater on my album called i got my locs on we made it happen
5558982 i had to bring out bun and get everything straight
5558983 we took a gatorade break and got everything straight we can agree to disagree but its all love
5558984 i took a verse off my president is black where i shouted out the whole n o shouted out soulja slim pimp c bg bun i summed everything up
5558985 everybody thought the situation with me and pimp was something else but it really wasnt that before pimp c passed he reached out to me and everything was good i wanted the world to know that rest in peace homie
5558986 murdered it esco went in esco is a cool n a though i cant even front hes a thorough n a he went in on the record i dont know what youre gonna think of it i cant even begin to tell you what he said im just telling you esco went in
5558987 im always in the hood im always in the community
5558988 imma say this and be frank a lot of cats come up from the hood ranks and everybody wanna rep the hood everybody wanna say they did this and that when nas repped me i feel a way im a cat from georgia hes from new york city so if he can respect my gangsta i definitely can respect his and anybody around him thats why i respect new york so much and chi town detroit same thing they respect my gangsta
5558989 the hip hop that im used to was the hip hop that express yourself came out of and fight the power
5558990 when krs was big when the bridge is over was big when it was a dis song but it wasnt a beef song when the nature of hip hop was beautiful no matter what the face of it was that day the outcome was always dope man from the spice 1 s to the kool g rap s thats what i miss when hip hop evolved and changed and got thrown in a bucket of kool aid somebody threw too much sugar in it now it tastes a little funny thats why i say hip hop broke my heart when i got in i thought it would preserve itself long enough to at least let me see the hip hop i was used to the hip hop i fell in love with but it didnt do that hip hop left the job for me to continue on and still pay homage to the way of old me and hip hop be beefing sometimes but no matter what face hip hop makes im gonna evolve with it
5558991 when youre in the studio with wayne you could pretty much chill man because everything is so easy
5558992 if you go back to little lil wayne to now you can see the dramatic changes hes everywhere what the f can you do besides come behind him i dont ever put nobody before myself i feel im the greatest alive i hold it down but wayne hes got it right now so i dont mind stepping behind for a minute until its my turn when its my turn my albums gonna run his down and well go at it again next time
5558993 entendemos que el causante de las aver as se debi a un evento fuerte de mal tiempo que trajo mucho rayos y que pas por el rea norte movi ndose de este a oeste

5558995 the principle of mega power policy is to lower power tariffs and bring relief to consumers how will the end consumer benefit by giving these benefits to captive power projects the power ministry is driving this case
5558996 we believe that big power generation capacity of any ownership should be encouraged because there is a power shortage in the country
5558997 it will help in bringing more power to the market as there is no openly traded power in the market there is a demand supply gap if you dont make investing in the power sector attractive such investments will go elsewhere
5558998 this revised policy will only lead to inequalities in the captive power generation space
5558999 marriage is just a stop on the way to divorcetown
5559000 sure get married for funsies everybody does but make sure youre prepared for all eventualities
5559001 they diverted us from roanoke to lynchburg and then we sat on the runway for a little bit in lynchburg and then they flew us here
5559002 we were descending and we got within 15 miles of the airport and wed already dropped and we were within just a few minutes of landing and we had to pull back up and re route
5559003 concerned not only for ourselves but concerned for customers that decided to continue stay here at the bridge until they were asked to leave

5559007 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5559008 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5559009 some people are talking about a 50 basis point cut this would put a bit of a dampener on that which is a positive for the aussie dollar
5559010 it doesnt have the degree of urgency which would suggest that the reserve bank sees itself about to embark on a 50 basis point move or a huge reduction in interest rates by the end of the year
5559011 that in turn is pretty supportive for the australian dollar in the short term

5559018 its flattering of course to be compared to zidane but its a little bit annoying as well
5559019 its a lot of pressure on my shoulders and really hard to be compared to probably the best footballer of the last 10 years when you are a young player you dont tend to play well every week so it is a lot of pressure
5559020 bring the players together even for a short time to discover where we at without there being anything really at stake points wise it will allow us to sort things out
5559021 one said she had never experienced such terror in her life judge clayton said

5559024 we need an airport here a big airport so everybody else doesnt have to drive to wilmington or charleston
5559025 without some sort of expansion i think its going to stifle any ability to recruit any additional airlines coming into the community

5559036 hiring wayt provides an opportunity to conduct a search for a city manager that is not under the pressure of time automatically imposed by having an interim person in the job
5559037 it takes the pressure off the city council and permits us to find the best possible candidate for the job
5559038 jack is well known well liked respected and trusted by staff members
5559039 i wouldnt say its super common but its not uncommon either especially when youre talking about highly skilled administrators who are in demand
5559040 a lot of people thought oh well youve been around forever no big deal
5559041 its a bigger deal than you think theres a learning curve here im not going to get it all in a real hurry because it takes time
5559042 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the
5559043 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
5559044 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5559045 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5559046 to promote civil discourse and the common good of all
5559047 for a 7o clock game i am usually here between 2 30pm and 3pm i go down to the clubhouse get our lineup we charlie slowes amp dave alternate the pre game interviews that is always the stressful part of the job who are you going to interview track that person down set it up and get that done then i will come upstairs start filling out my scorebook filling in some stats about the lineup
5559048 so we get those 30 minutes to eat in that time we pre record a couple of pre game segments the starting pitching matchups and feed the pre game interview back to the station then one half hour before the game we are on
5559049 tough question to answer i think the game just kind of takes care of itself every game is different depending on who the starting pitcher is we might follow him and see how john lannan is doing that night or how collin balester is doing or tonight how tim redding is doing there is a different storyline in every game even if the nationals are not fighting for a playoff spot you will find a storyline
5559050 i am crazy about the nationals i am nuts about the naaaats lets go nats
5559051 ill take that song over hail to the redskins any day
5559052 nuts about the nats is the number one fight song in dc
5559053 you guys travel with the team all the time how more convenient is that when approaching the players coaches and manager and getting them to talk as compared to an out of town reporter sbf
5559054 like the pre game interviews we were talking about before its much easier to do an interview in our clubhouse because you know the guys and they know you and hopefully they have developed a level of trust with you its always harder if you go and try to interview a visiting player they may not know you and its easier for them to try to blow you off or put you off i think i have developed a good relationship with the players in the locker room i feel comfortable going up to them and asking them for an interview or just to talk there are certain guys you go and talk to about other things than baseball they are just good people to talk to
5559055 i actually dont think it is tough at all my wife jen puts it in real good perspective my first year in washington 2006 i was talking about a long flight we had to san diego or somewhere and she said you could be on a bus to ottawa right now all of us busting out laughing so i always remember that if i ever have any complaints which i i could be on a bus to ottawa i am in the major leagues doing what i love to do and just because the team is out of contention i treat every game as if it is the most important game i am going to that way i give my best effort and try to provide the best broadcast of the game that i am doing that day i am not worried about how many games they have lost or how many games they have won today is the game we are going to talk about
5559056 because you really never know what is going to happen and i get caught up in the emotion of the game when the ball hits the bat the crowd comes to its feet and senses the ball that maybe ryan zimmerman connected to a ball that is going to go out if you listen closely you can sense a surge in emotion in my voice in trying to describe what happens so i get caught up almost as if i was involved as a player which obviously i am not saying i am but its just a fun place to be
5559057 sure you have to be if you are going to watch 162 games over 182 days or whatever it is you better like the game if you dont like baseball you should not be here in the booth
5559058 by myself i might have done a little dance in the room with no one witnessing it i worked hard i went to college for this and dreamed about being an announcer in the professional ranks i was in the business for nearly 15 years paying a lot of dues in different areas i didnt come up just through the minor leagues like many announcers do in baseball but whether i was doing a talk show or doing college basketball or working one job and moonlighting at three other places i really worked hard to get where i am so i felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment to reach this level which is something i aspired to for a long long time
5559059 we met each other on the winter caravan 2006 it might have been when i also first met you sbf which is true i did that winter caravan with brian schneider brandon watson ryan zimmerman was on that caravan and jose guillen
5559060 he called me up after he got hired to introduce himself to me over the phone which is kind of bizarre would you say looking at the african queen and i to some degree so he dave got hired and before i had the chance to call him he got my number from kevin ullich and called me we talked on the phone and i think we met two weeks later
5559061 i knew about him i knew his name from doing the washington bullets when you aspire to get to this level you know the people who have the jobs you know the names its much easier to listen to people now with xm radio i had never really heard him charlie prior to working with him but i certainly knew who he was
5559062 i think this is a great ballpark its great for the nationals to call this their home you know they are going to be here for a very long time i am very excited that the nationals have found a new home
5559063 weve gotten use to it its a hard spot to accurately describe pitches but we have gotten use to how the ball carries off the bat you just wait to see the play unfold rather than anticipate because if you try to anticipate what is going to happen you have just a good a chance of being wrong it is very hard to judge where the ball is going to go when it is hit
5559064 oh yes whenever we play a first day of any series i always talk to the other teams broadcasters you cant always use all the information but they will tell you what is going on with their team and why a guy is playing over another who is pitching well or playing well that is a very useful resource to be up on the other team because when you are filling three hours on the air you are not going to talk exclusively about the nationals you are going to talk about the other team so i always talk to the other broadcasters and i try to offer analysis on our team to the other guys as well
5559065 as you are around the game more you have friends that youve met there are guys when i was broadcasting games in pawtucket for the pawsox that are now in the big leagues and i always enjoy catching up with a lot of fun kind of a reunion to see i know a lot of guys in the mets clubhouse from different times in my career so i enjoy getting to catch up with those guys its not awkward in any fun to go see them and quite honestly its another resource you can ask them honest questions about why he is not playing against left handed pitching and he schneider will give you an honest answer maybe you would not go up and ask that same question from the opposing team if you did not know them
5559066 when you are on the road for 81 games plus travel basically three months of the year that you are away from your family i try to be a full time dad one son and one daughter i do all the school bus meets you are mr mom the african queen yes i am mr mom i take the kids off to the bus i am there when the bus gets home i do swim lessons fall little league soccer practice i try to cram in everything that i missed in the five months from the time the baseball season ends and spring training begins
5559067 yes it is hard my oldest one understands what i do my youngest she knows what i do but she doesnt understand i will see you in a week i could see you tomorrow or see you in a week can mean the same thing so it hard to say goodbye to them when you are going away for an extended period
5559068 we have a really good thing going on here working with charlie i would like to develop something here that a generation of nats fans can associate listening to the radio with us that is the true testament of an announcer when people associate you with the team that you are with and that takes time to develop we have been together a short time but i think we have developed a tremendous following with the fans and i think part of the reason we have the popularity is that so many people enjoy the camaraderie the back and forth we have you guys have great chemistry sohna separately we are not as strong as one unit
5559069 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5559070 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5559071 i do not undertake to promote welfare for i propose

5559073 i do not undertake to promote welfare for i propose to extend freedom my aim is not to pass laws but to repeal them it is not to inaugurate new programs but to cancel old ones that do violence to the constitution
5559074 you dont need to search for answers god did it
5559075 a government that is big enough to give you all you want
5559076 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
5559077 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
5559078 those who seek absolute power even though they seek it to do what they regard as good are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth and let me remind you they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyrannies
5559079 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
5559080 may god grant us the ability to use what we will receive in classes today for the betterment of ourselves and the wisdom eventually to use this knowledge for the betterment of mankind god bless us all and may god bless america

5559087 such is the irresistible nature of truth that all it asks and all it wants is the liberty of appearing
5559088 atheism as an explicit position can be either the affirmation of the nonexistence of gods 1 or the rejection of theism 2 it is also 3 defined more broadly as synonymous with any form of nontheism including the simple absence of belief in deities
5559089 pantheism the belief that the physical universe is equivalent to god and that there is no division
5559090 you are just trying to save yourself trouble in case a fight breaks out
5559091 we do not know if mary died and was assumed body and soul into heaven or if she was assumed without dying
5559092 there are not elaborate writings by the fathers on the assumption because it was not a main point of reflection
5559093 god the king of the universe has granted you favors that surpass nature as he kept you a virgin in childbirth thus he has kept your body incorrupt in the tomb and has glorified it by his divine act of transferring it from the tomb
5559094 as the most glorious mother of christ our savior and god and the giver of life and immortality has been endowed with life by him she has received an eternal incorruptibility of the body together with him who has raised her up from the tomb and has taken her up to himself in a way known only to him
5559095 i find it immensely disturbing that a layman is needed to correct seriously erroneous teachings issued by a presbyter who according to presbyterorum ordinis 4 and the code of canon law 528 is to have the ministry of preaching and teaching foremost among his tasks
5559096 t he fundamental problem the eastern orthodox have is that theologically they see it as western
5559097 for how should she taste death from whom true life had flowed unto all

5559101 arise my beloved my beautiful one and come see the rains are over and done
5559102 the saying is sure if we have died with him we shall also live with him if we endure we shall also reign with him
5559103 be faithful unto death and i will give you the crown of life
5559104 peculiar to christs sacrifice are the infinite value of victim which give the sacrifice an infinite value of expiation and as merit
5559105 you are just trying to save yourself trouble in case a fight breaks out

5559122 these condition are expected to lead to higher levels of virus activity and greater exposure of humans to the viruses prof dunstan said
5559123 however australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the ross river barmah forrest kunjin japanese encephalitis murray valley encephalitis and dengue viruses prof dunstan said
5559124 the risk of emergence of transfusion transmissible infectious diseases emphasises the need for countries to work together to help each other maintain their blood supplies during epidemics and pandemics the researchers wrote in their report
5559125 this is particularly important should a major infectious disease pandemic occur in different countries at different times

5559131 this is a big to do at the moment but in a few weeks people will have forgotten what the issue was all about its because users expect more from apple there are many more users saying their iphones work than not
5559132 weve got the new firmware up and running and its true those bugs have been fixed
5559133 which bugs well its hard to say but our voice suddenly sounds deeper and weve noticed improved grammar during calls
5559134 the mobile device is more targeted than the desktop device
5559135 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
5559136 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
5559137 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game

5559139 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5559140 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5559141 importantly the sotg located him positively identified him and when it was confirmed that there were no non combatant afghans nearby accurately targeted him for the successful isaf international security assistance force airstrike
5559142 the music transforms him his goofy grin dissolves into a glower his eyes turn cold as ice the hip hop beats have a hypnotic effect on phelps who sometimes after a race is unable to recall the songs that locked him into his groove
5559143 mccain has been there all these years and weve seen diddly squat
5559144 ive been working very hard on my project hdk for several years so it was very important for me to find a label that is specialised in the more extreme side of metal but also experienced in the style of after forever i already worked together with season of mist when they released the first after forever albums in france so i know they will do a good job for hdk as well my project is a mix of all kinds of metal styles the label has to be able to give it its full attention in order to promote this the right way and i feel confident season of mist is able to do that perfectly
5559145 he estado trabajando muy duro en mi proyecto hdk durante varios a os entonces era muy importante para m poder encontrar un sello que es especializado en el lado m s extremo de metal pero que tambi n experiment en el estilo de after forever ya trabaj junto con la temporada de la niebla cuando ellos lanzaron los primeros lbumes de after forever en francia entonces s que ellos har n un trabajo bueno para hdk tambi n mi proyecto es una mezcla de todas las clases de estilos del metal el sello tiene que ser capaz de prestarle su atenci n por completo a fin de promover esto del modo correcto y me siento confidente que seasons of mist es capaz de hacer esto perfectamente

5559187 we are proud to be the first major playground manufacturer to do something about the actual problem of pvc and not just offset its effects by other means
5559188 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5559189 unfortunately a lot of them are not going to be able to be answered in the immediate future
5559190 i dont think no 1 were ever going to put the suspicions to bed theres always going to be a spore on the grassy knoll
5559191 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5559192 electronic timing devices record how long each competitor takes to complete the course the device starts timing when the starters horn goes off each lane has an electronic touch pad on the wall that the swimmer pushes when completing the race the pad stops the timing device and records the swimmers time in a computer the score is then transferred to a scoreboard that the swimmers fans and judges can see each lane also has a timekeeper with a handheld stopwatch in case the electronic timing device fails all timing is done to the hundredth of a second and many races are decided by small margins
5559193 techtv i havent heard that name in a very long time

5559196 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5559197 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5559198 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5559199 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5559200 before the case is over were gonna play the confession of the defendant so the jury can hear the defendant state what he did and why he did it in his own words and i believe that will help the jury come to the conclusion that this person is competent
5559201 ive been looking for a time and an opportunity to ask for forgiveness to the families i feel sad and a lot of pain to see what has happened and i am extremely sorry to his wife
5559202 when he was living here a lot of the time he would hear voices and the voices would tell him to do things
5559203 its really scary because like my dad said man everybody knows he wasnt right in the head
5559204 no even before when he didnt know about that stuff he started hearing things
5559205 we have cousins my nephew is mentally retarded we have cousins uncles that are mentally retarded their blood is related to each others parents
5559206 my mom and dad theyre cousins so theyre cousins the same blood but i dont know how to tell you but it comes from the family my other cousins you will see a lot of people like that
5559207 he says i dont know i dont know whats going on he said he didnt know why he did it he just doesnt know why
5559208 im sorry for the family their suffering were also suffering too because what my son has done he is not aware of it hes not right in the head
5559209 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5559210 roaming arrangements for 3g roaming on parts of telstras 850mhz network will be in place during the second quarter of next year
5559211 plans to extend our 3g network means our customers will be able to access their 3g services in far more places and with the appetite for services like the internet on the mobile growing rapidly it makes good sense
5559212 these initiatives will also reduce our roaming costs both new sites being added and lower wholesale roaming costs will have a significant impact
5559213 telstras game changing next g network has taken 3g competition to a new level forcing competitors to respond optus and vodafone both plan nationwide 3g networks vodafone will reach 96 per cent by end 2008 optus will reach 98 per cent by end 2009
5559214 although 3 offers national coverage via telstras 2g network its 3g coverage remains at only 56 per cent in a game where coverage is king 3 had potential to be squeezed
5559215 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5559216 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5559217 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5559218 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5559219 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5559220 i think perhaps she was shocked and didnt know what to say
5559221 shes representative of what happens to the patients we see
5559222 a lot of the patients we see think theyre going crazy
5559223 its appropriate for doctors to ask about stress the mistake is to assume thats what it is
5559224 their reactions made me feel like a whiner like i was making up all of these bizarre symptoms
5559225 she said i do believe theres something wrong with you but we dont know what it is
5559226 he said i didnt marry your ovaries i married you he has been there for me and all the doctors at nih have been great
5559227 i was in pain i had bad depression i was irritable i lost my mom when i was 3 and i worried that history was repeating itself
5559228 over half the women weve seen had seen over three different doctors before an fsh test was ordered
5559229 it takes some out of the box thinking in that 15 minute window
5559230 the health care community needs to be more aware of this
5559231 can make it difficult to walk up and down stairs or run hop jump or kick a ball
5559232 he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition

5559236 an entire generation of developing world youth would be removed from the cockpit of religious fundamentalism presuming they dont make the hideous mistake of moving to the american bible belt and would be exposed to the irresistible distractions of sex drugs and rocknroll they would be won over forever to the light side of the force the enlightenment liberalism atheism sexual permissiveness punk rock disco dancing ice cream real ale books puppy dogs and all that good stuff
5559237 in this market unless i have a reason to think a movie like this is going to be a slam dunk im not going to take a flyer on it even with heath ledger
5559238 when i am playing belle i have to play a sexually liberated empowered young prostitute but unfortunately i felt like a sweating sea cow
5559239 we wont rule it out but we are working on a christmas special now
5559240 theres a fear in the oil market right now about some of the pretty dramatic news weve seen coming out of the united states spreading into europe and japan
5559241 oil if you think about it has got plenty of room to fall
5559242 i think that is a very likely scenario for many asian markets including india
5559243 we should be ready with our first value format store before the end of this financial year our pilot store will get launched early next year
5559244 we have already got our supply chain in place and the apparel will be sourced from our existing network
5559245 in value based retail people are not necessarily brand conscious unlike in high end retailing we would be developing our own brands in this segment
5559246 bless our family that we left behind may the journey be easy may we be blocked from seeing ugly things

5559253 it hasnt been worked on by visual designers yet so dont judge the user experience
5559254 i dont think that they mean to treat you differently its just something that happens
5559255 we need to do a major education effort aimed at the public because the stigma with mental illness is clearly clearly out there
5559256 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5559257 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5559258 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5559259 meanwhile less than half of canadians think people struggling with drug and alcohol addictions have a mental illness says the report
5559260 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
5559261 it is a growth opportunity we are certainly open to get into the beer market but we do not want to enter the market on our own
5559262 el era el espejo en el que yo me miraba cuando era ni o le voy al equipo am rica y cuauht moc siempre fue mi jugador favorito ojal yo llegue a ser tan bueno como l
5559263 pensamos imponer nuestra condici n de local para eso debemos jugad como sabemos
5559264 son varios los rivales que me han retado y en una semana definir quien ser el elegido
5559265 hay muchos oponentes en la lista incluido manny pacquiao quien sigue siendo un viable contendiente pues las negociaciones no han terminado
5559266 he recibido muchos retos y margarito tambi n est incluido as como sergio mora quien creo junto a pacquiao son los m s cercanos a mi decisi n
5559267 si alguien me preguntara a quien enfrentar a de margarito o paul williams responder a que williams que venci a margarito que reclama ser el mejor welter tras vencer a miguel cotto pero para terminar con esos dimes y diretes creo que williams y margarito deben acabar con lo que iniciaron en una pelea de revancha ese es el pleito l gico para ellos
5559268 richard schaefer tiene la orden de buscarme la pelea m s lucrativa en t rminos econ micos mientras que en lo deportivo yo me encargar de definir el rival de entre todos los que me retan y que est n haciendo fila
5559269 ahorita ando en 150 libras y estoy seguro que puedo dar el welter de no darse la pelea contra pacquiao en 147 libras existe la alternativa de pelearle a sergio mora en una cita hist rica por todo lo que encierra su trayectoria mora y la m a en un escenario local como el dodger stadium o el coliseo de los angeles
5559270 si los hondure os son tan buenos que lo demuestren
5559271 son jugadores de experiencia varios est n en europa y ser n un rival dif cil pero nosotros tenemos la meta de no dejar escapar puntos como locales aunque honduras jamaica y canad son contrarios muy duros
5559272 estoy muy contento en mi regreso quiero aportar a la meta principal que es clasificarnos a la copa mundial
5559273 estoy feliz he sido tomado en cuenta para un nuevo proceso con un nuevo entrenador habr mucha lucha por los puestos de titulares y al final el beneficiado ser el grupo
5559274 el rival es complicado pero estamos mentalizados para jugar bien
5559275 they took prayer out of schools and now they want to take it away from the citizens here in southport
5559276 i think he came out of the chute too quick in january throwing things at us right and left some of the programs he wanted to start were not ready to deal with that yet
5559277 we got together we contemplated the values and priorities and principles that we all share and came up with a solution that is good for all of us thats exactly what city government small town government should do

5559285 love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile
5559286 the definition of an idiot someone who repeatedly does the same thing but expects different results not learning from the experience
5559287 the cynic that i am makes me wonder if this is just riding on the back of the georgia bigfoot gubbins

5559296 i think its the most beautiful performance in the world
5559297 are a priority of our nation so we think our thing is the best
5559298 in terms of results to resources ratio its no contest bang for buck
5559299 if you gave the arirang organizers 300 million to put on one show id imagine something vastly more impressive than the beijing opening ceremonies
5559300 no artists or labels have complained the site is not closed indefinitely stay tuned
5559301 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5559302 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5559303 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5559304 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5559305 i just have to be smart and handle myself like a professional at all times
5559306 i dont think it would be productive for our football team
5559307 theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right
5559308 todays verdict sends the message that health care providers who fraudulently bill for their services will be held accountable for their crimes
5559309 these defendants received millions of dollars that they were not entitled to by lying to insurers about the services they were providing patients these lies contribute to the problem of soaring health costs for all
5559310 we dont get enough information from the pre paids to know if they are pre paid
5559311 if it is a contiguous county it doesnt really matter were one button away
5559312 we get a lot of misroutes from fayette and some from clayton
5559313 we were not informed that he was leaving the country
5559314 generally only an accuseds passport is impounded and then too when there is definite proof
5559315 we have just got an fsl report that says he is innocent and there was also a report from the computer experts that said he was innocent
5559316 you know what to be honest i come to the ballpark i dont ask about joe crede
5559317 im not going to say hes out of my mind but hes out of my picture thats the way im going about my job ive got 25 problems i dont need 26
5559318 one day he was very angry with me and said why dont you join the army and become a man
5559319 so the next day i went to the chicago recruiting station and enlisted as a private in the army air corps at scott field
5559320 they rattled the dishes when they took off over the house
5559321 one of the men liked to play tricks on those who were on duty such as tying the mattresses up and putting them in the diagonal braces of the posts
5559322 we got tired of it so one morning as we came off duty we found him sound asleep and carefully moved him and his bunk to the middle of the ball field with six inches of snow on the ground
5559323 in a few minutes he woke up and looked around in amazement he made a barefooted run for the barracks in his underwear amid gales of laughter we had no further trouble from him
5559324 the japanese sneak attack on pearl harbor was a great shock to all of us what was even more amazing to many of us enlisted men was the panic that struck some of the higher echelon
5559325 they reacted as if an attack on cochran field could happen at any time
5559326 we flew upside down did slow rolls snap rolls spins loops chandelles dives stalls and a few i didnt have time to recognize for two hours straight
5559327 thats the first time in my life that i didnt feel a little disappointed when we started to land i went to sleep after that with my shoes and glasses on and woke up in the morning with my shoes under my bunk and my glasses on the shelf and i know that i didnt put them there love eddie
5559328 wearing a skirt sweater bobby socks saddle oxfords and a bright smile
5559329 three hours after i met helen i gave her a sterling silver ring which she accepted
5559330 we can make rules and policies till the cows come home but until you see it in practice the standards and curriculum and the ways theyre put into place
5559331 i studied it in pittsburgh but i saw it in action here
5559332 and there is still only 36 weeks in a school year
5559333 what would be acceptable in fulton county may not be acceptable in coweta county
5559334 the state government doesnt have the luxury of the federal government by having a big credit card
5559335 trying hard for it not to have a negative impact in the classroom
5559336 he knows first and foremost that k 12 education is our future
5559337 he also has to balance the budget of the state he doesnt have a choice
5559338 we do extremely well considering our population but when you read it in the paper you cant tell
5559339 thats a higher score than has even been recorded by algebra or geometry eocts theyve never gotten above 75 percent its just phenomenal
5559340 because members of the million dollar band are admitted to football games free tickets ordered by these students are being reallocated to allow more students to attend
5559341 its my joy to welcome you to cedar hill the pinson skinner home
5559342 one as descendants of our revered family patriarch sam pinson one of the skilled slaves that lived on the william boyd plantation we gather today in memory of our ancestors and me rich family heritage they bequeath to us many we acknowledge and express thanksgiving for our strong family ties and the contributions of the penson family members that have preceded us one we declare our interest in and commitment to the survival of the family unit we pray for continued faith strength and love for our family and families everywhere and for future generations many we pray for understanding wisdom and power for families around me world one remove from our minds hatred prejudice and contempt for those who are not of our family race or color class or creed that departing from everything that estranges and divides we may be brought into unity of spirit in the bond of peace many make us one lord make us one as we celebrate the bonds of kinship established through your love in the penson family holy spirit make us one
5559343 god of our weary years god of our silent tears thou who has brought us thus far on the way thou who has by thy might led us into me light keep us forever in the path we pray
5559344 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5559345 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5559346 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5559347 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5559348 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5559349 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5559350 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5559351 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5559352 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5559353 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5559354 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5559355 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5559356 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5559357 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5559358 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying arise and go down to the potters house and there i will cause thee to hear my words then i went down to the potters house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it
5559359 heres an xbox 360 exclusive that proudly wears its lofty ambitions on its sleeves and yet sometimes seems bent on self sabotage that its so relentlessly addictive despite its aggravations is something of a minor miracle
5559360 whats been delivered in the end is a good game that ultimately falls just short of its promise due to a few questionable design decisions one thing is for sure though if you love collecting random loot drops youll find a lot to like here
5559361 if you have an insatiable lust for items with higher stats than the ones youre currently using or if you get giddy at the mere thought of diablo style rare item naming conventions youll probably be able to look past the games issues and have a good time but even at its best its hard to ignore too humans monotonous combat and dated approach to cooperative play
5559362 too human is a game of false starts and unrealized potential that infiltrate almost every aspect of the game from story to combat to balance its elements feel stitched together making for a patchwork quilt of a game thats fraying at the seams
5559363 were all carriers for something we just dont always know what
5559364 ooh he looks good did you see his gene card
5559365 i was falling in love with her but then i saw her bad genes
5559366 this show is a huge hit to muslim and non muslim audiences alike
5559367 i used to think that watching game shows was a complete waste of time but daleel or no daleel has showed me that wasting time can be educational
5559368 beard is only good for picking up sisters at muslim fun day at the mosque
5559369 you want the daleel you want the daleel you cant handle the daleel
5559370 when i told my kids that were having tuna casserole tonight they just turned around and shouted no daleel to me i mean that doesnt even make any sense
5559371 this is just as bad as those other shows like wheel of fitna or who wants to be an imam
5559372 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5559373 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5559374 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5559375 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5559376 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5559377 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5559378 this could also be a means for our probation and parole officers for those who are actually out on parole who need a step up in their supervision
5559379 the bells started ringing loudly when state opposition leader colin barnett came out recently talking about the kimberley being the next pilbara and that industrial activity in the kimberley was on the rise and he was excited about that and in fact he was going to promote that
5559380 the kimberley coastline is a wonderful area its one of the great natural landscapes of australia and it certainly needs to be protected
5559381 she was a democrat a liberal a strong minded person
5559382 she was a big supporter of the church but she was also a supporter of separation of church and state and she brought me up that way
5559383 just watching to see if people were going to throw things in the yard or kill my dogs
5559384 why are there no religious moderates stopping the evil religionists
5559385 why are there so few given the large numbers of supposed moderates out there
5559386 both men openly boldly and unashamedly come right out and say they are catholics
5559387 yeah but ive heard those climate scientists have financial interests too their grants are tied to predicting doom
5559388 reframe the argument to attack the denialists as misguided or unqualified or financially compromised
5559389 look you have scientists with phds in geosciences being called denialists just because you cant argue against what they say
5559390 people questioning the science who are quite capable of engaging in critical discussions of scientific methodology
5559391 successful framing requires research on how nontraditional audiences perceive science and what aspects of complex science debates are personally meaningful to them on the basis of those results further research can explore which phrases examples and metaphors succeed best in conveying that meaning
5559392 no matter how cynical you become its never enough to keep up
5559393 now as an epistemologist of the analytic feminist persuasion i happen to reject value free justification
5559394 a catastrophe is likely to occur in say 100 years nuclear war global warming whatever that will result in bad things happening to the humans who are around then but i wont be around then so i dont care
5559395 i dont think anything is going to happen to me in the future because nothing much is happening to me now
5559396 global warming seems to have missed buffalo this winter ha ha
5559397 its a little weird to think that we put my beloved wife at risk of a 0 01 probability of dying 3 times just to spawn those ungrateful kids
5559398 late term abortions are much more dangerous for the mother
5559399 show him where a fetus is a thing as many of the discussions here seem to treat them
5559400 tell him how a fetus is not and will not become a human being
5559401 americas a continent not a country thank you very much no im not canadian okay so its speech short hand still annoying

5559407 a dditionally the chimp refuge has little respect for our desire to enter the battlefield of ideas that is the blogosphere
5559408 in addition to our words in opposition to civil unions and gay marriage now this post defending ted nugent
5559409 hey we were just funnin with ya grow a sense of humor
5559410 heres a youtube of what we here at the grok do sometimes on the weekends to unwind im sure that it wont sit well with the liberal monkeys at the chimp refuge but oh well maybe if they took their sons out to do something like this instead of to the gay pride rally er never mind
5559411 you apparently blocked us at least earlier because it wouldnt accept it
5559412 doug is boasting on his site how you are not allowing him to comment how dishonest can these assholes get
5559413 you are not blocked were not blocked and never have been blocked further there are no comments in the junk file maybe youre just incompetent i mean its not like there isnt precedent for that
5559414 as a gun owner and a childless happily married chimp all i can say is classy
5559415 vulnerable male and female children with raging hormones were going to be intensely recruited by homosexuals to practice homosexuality

5559418 hoe dat gebeurt maakt me niet uit of ik er nou tien twintig of drie inknal als we als team maar blijven winnen natuurlijk is het een lekker gevoel als de strafcorners erin blijven vliegen maar het is zeker niet mijn belangrijkste focus hier

5559422 but it permanently builds in a reduction in the state aid that we have worked so hard to really raise
5559423 lets not forget those who really most need our services the very poor the elderly the vulnerable people with hiv or people who are abused its very easy to target those folks first because theyre voiceless theres nobody lobbying for them at the capitol

5559462 we were doing the show and it felt good but something was missing and it was that spontaneity and that fun that we now have on the show
5559463 we just kind of like got ourselves out of trying to be so perfect and that kind of made this onslaught of basically humiliating us being self effacing not being so serious and then all the physical stuff comes along

5559467 its flattering of course to be compared to zidane but its a little bit annoying as well
5559468 its a lot of pressure on my shoulders and really hard to be compared to probably the best footballer of the last 10 years when you are a young player you dont tend to play well every week so it is a lot of pressure

5559481 hay elementos suficientes para encausar la voz del pueblo porque se afecta el presupuesto esta controversia est con base en argumentos presupuestales y en ese sentido se est afectando el gasto destinado a programas sociales
5559482 el primer argumento es la voz del pueblo que no est de acuerdo en que se le de a los partidos pol ticos cinco veces m s de dinero p blico que puede ser para necesidades fundamentales de agua de salud de educaci n de vivienda para la poblaci n la gente no est de acuerdo en que los partidos reciban 500 por ciento m s
5559483 estas modificaciones que aumentaron el presupuesto a los partidos pol ticos violenta el fin de la reforma constitucional federal que disminuye en 11 por ciento los recursos para los partidos tenemos 11 por ciento menos a nivel federal y 500 por ciento m s es injustificable el pueblo de jalisco lo pide y el gobernador por eso interpone la controversia
5559484 porque eso habla de su anhelo de apegarse al derecho a la constituci n y eso me da mucho gusto
5559485 en primer lugar quiero felicitar porque no hab a tenido tiempo de hacerlo al gobernador porque al irse l a la suprema corte y presentar una controversia constitucional nos habla de que todas las decisiones en el estado de jalisco van a estar apegadas a derecho que estar l al pendiente y el legislativo tambi n que ninguna demanda obedezca a intereses particulares o partidistas esto nos habla de que cuidaremos mucho todo lo que diga la constituci n
5559486 por una diferencia entre el poder ejecutivo y el legislativo podemos poner en riesgo la vida democr tica de jalisco es un aspecto en la ley no por el dinero sino que jalisco puede estar en la indefinici n nadie ni el instituto electoral ni los partidos pol ticos ni el propio ejecutivo en este momento sabe con qu reglas van a jugar

5559541 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5559542 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5559543 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5559544 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5559545 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5559546 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together

5559571 unlike a fall sweep stakes letter when we send a letter out and it comes from the union hall the member is absolutely going to open it because it could pertain to health care or a change in a benefit its not going to get tossed aside and it will get read

5559597 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5559598 president bush appreciate president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5559599 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges that they face
5559600 he has not today and well keep you updated if that changes
5559601 we are going to continue working with the government of pakistan
5559602 the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5559603 so the government of pakistan the prime minister realizes that they need to go after terrorists and extremists because they are trying to destabilize the government of pakistan as well so we are confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorist the government of pakistan will continue in the effort
5559604 this is a transition that the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan made a decision as well as president musharraf made this decision to resign these are issues that they are going to have to work through their political process
5559605 while this political process is underway we certainly expect they will keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists because of what i just said this is a fight that they are in as well
5559606 what he has said repeatedly is they understand that these extremists are going after the government of pakistan they are trying to destabilize pakistan and so its not only a threat to the united states western europe and the whole free world but its a threat to pakistan as well and thats why we will all continue to work on going after the extremists
5559607 lets be clear the extremist ideology is one that has been out there and among these groups for many years they have an ideology of hatred and an ideology that doesnt allow little girls to go to school and is not really an ideology known for its respect for human rights
5559608 so let us be clear about where this started and thats with the extremists
5559609 the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that this is a fight they are also in osama bin laden or ayman al zawahiri just a few days ago i think issued a video saying that they wanted to go after the government of pakistan as well
5559610 so these extremists and terrorists groups are not limiting their fight to just the united states its pakistanis its muslims around the world the thousands of muslims theyve killed since 9 111 as well as going after the united states and western europe so were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
5559611 im not aware of any discussions regarding that so i dont think its an issue we have to take up

5559618 a coach came round the corner just completely on my side i just didnt have a hope in hell so i just had to run into it
5559619 peoplell say it takes something like this to make people realise how silly it is to bring all this heavy traffic through such a quiet country village
5559620 you would hope it would kick people into some sort of action to get it changed or to have more traffic calming
5559621 proposals have been made for alternative routes but nothings ever been built despite years of campaigning by villagers
5559622 its great that alton towers is successful but unfortunately the roads havent changed to match
5559623 its lovely to keep the quaintness of the village i wouldnt like to see anything widened
5559624 i think its more of an answer where they could possibly try and find a way to take the bigger vehicles on a different route maybe
5559625 coaches gridlock nearly every day through the height of season
5559626 i am shocked that something has happened there because in the past its been normally somewhere on the bank here further into the village where its tighter and windier
5559627 i always slow down before i come to it and try and avoid cars coming towards me
5559628 if theres a bus or a lorry then ill wait and let it cross
5559629 theres been a lot of worry about buses coming through the village because the roads arent built to cope
5559630 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5559631 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5559632 he is looking forward to coming back he is thinking about being free but worried about reporters
5559633 he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart
5559634 he was not in touch with me but i am not aware that he was in touch with the us government but i cant vouch for that given that i have been flying
5559635 president musharraf took his country a long way turning it back from extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of september 11 2001
5559636 he also kept his promise to try and help transition pakistan to free and fair elections
5559637 we didnt agree with everything that he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the uniform the elections were free and fair and he served as a good ally for the united states
5559638 we have long stood for the transition to democracy there and we have established very good relations with the democratically elected government and we have a lot of work to do to support them economically politically and in security terms so that they can fight the terrorists and the militants who threaten not only american interest but threaten very much pakistani interest as shown by the assassination of benazir bhutto by militants
5559639 obviously its a fragile situation in pakistan because its a new civilian government for the first time in a long time in pakistan since 1999 when musharraf overthrew then prime minister nawaz sharif in a bloodless coup
5559640 and so our effort is to support that government strengthen it
5559641 we have very detailed discussions going on within the g 7 for instance on economic support for pakistan of the kind that the prime minister asked for when he was in washington with the president
5559642 it is our intention and its the intention of our allies as well to do everything that we can to strengthen that government
5559643 obviously its a difficult and fragile time but it is an elected government i think it has fabulous support and thats a lot to build on
5559644 i dont subscribe to the notion that theres not leadership in pakistan
5559645 theres a democratically elected prime minister of pakistan there a government that came into being as a coalition and its had its difficulties internally weve made the point to the pakistanis that they need to focus intensely and intensively on what is going on in the fata federally administered tribal areas as well as the militants increasing capability and it appears willingness to attack targets outside of the fata not to mention whats going on the other side of the border
5559646 we have very good military to military ties we have very good cooperation and discussions through multiple channels
5559647 we have had a number of american high ranking military officials in pakistan recently
5559648 ultimately as i said its a fragile situation with a new government
5559649 we believe that this new government can succeed in taking on these terrorists weve talked about some of the strategies we think that the strategy of trying to negotiate in the fata has not demonstrated results and weve been very clear about that
5559650 well your boys can take care of this on tuesday night then you were good neighbors the wife is really sad about leaving you you were a good friend to her all shes done is cry because were moving away from you call her every now and then would ya she really cares about you and your boys

5559655 struck his opponent in the chest area with his helmet
5559656 i got blasted in my jaw and was out that happens its football everyones running around there trying to hit each other and hit each other hard and the guy got me
5559657 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the
5559658 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
5559659 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning

5559667 we see now theres a real high degree of interest for investment in windsor not by accident because weve developed a climate for that to happen so we need to take advantage of this opportunity because im not convinced its going to last for a long long time

5559673 on the grounds that it only seeks to pay cheaper flexible severance payments in making staff redundant
5559674 in supporting evidence the union says that because the purpose of the scheme is to help reduce the number of civilian staff by at least 5 000 the mod should use the more favourable compulsory severance terms rather than seeking to make job cuts on the cheap

5559718 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5559719 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5559720 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5559721 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5559727 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5559728 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5559729 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5559759 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5559760 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5559761 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5559762 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5559763 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5559764 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5559765 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5559766 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5559767 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5559771 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5559772 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5559773 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

5559775 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5559776 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5559777 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5559778 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5559779 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5559780 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5559781 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5559782 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5559783 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5559784 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5559785 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5559786 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5559787 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5559788 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5559789 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5559790 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5559791 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5559792 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5559793 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5559794 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5559795 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5559796 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5559797 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5559798 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
