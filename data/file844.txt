8440001 m am adaptat mai usor la scoala in italia decit cind m am intors in romania
8440002 la clasele a sasea si a saptea pe foaia matricola imi apar liniute
8440003 atunci cind programele difera radical elevii se intorc in tara si sint nevoiti sa reia de unde au ramas in anumite cazuri se decide in interesul copilului si este interpretata metodologia pentru ca elevul sa nu fie prejudiciat
8440004 echivalarea studiilor este o problema generalizata nu exista o metodologie bine inchegata noi inaintam dosarele elevilor la inspectoratul scolar care le trimite mai departe la minister comisiile de acolo decid soarta elevilor ei sint cei care propun ca elevii sa dea diferente sa repete clasa sau sa continue studiul pentru anul scolar viitor avem trei dosare inaintate care asteapta solutionarea
8440005 in italia nu am facut deloc chimie si fizica iar ce am invatat la celelalte obiecte era mai usor decit ce se face in romania
8440006 munceam cu ora ca sa pot avea timp sa il petrec cu familia mea care trebuia sa se adapteze numai eu eram vorbitoare de italiana iar in licata se vorbea mult si licateza adica un dialect sicilian
8440007 programul nu imi permitea sa o iau de la scoala ea stia cind ajunge acasa ca trebuie sa ma sune zona sicilia este destul de periculoasa pe stradutele inguste puteai vedea ziua in amiaza mare traficanti de droguri
8440008 incepeam orele la 8 30 diferenta este ca nu aveam decit o singura pauza intre 10 si 10 15 in care luam masa impreuna cu profesorii securitatea era foarte mare daca intirziai trebuia sa treci pe la director apoi era un profesor de serviciu in fiecare zi
8440009 practic am invatat italiana direct la scoala colegii imi mai spuneau si imi mai aratau cum se spune la un lucru sau altul am avut ceva probleme cu scrierea dar m am descurcat pina la urma profesorii au fost si ei intelegatori o luna jumatate mi a fost suficienta sa ma adaptez cu limba perioada aceea nu a trebuit sa imi fac temele oricum la ei e mult mai usor
8440010 mai era doar o fata in alta clasa ceva mai mica decit mine in rest nu am avut colegi romani
8440011 in italia iti permiti sa ti trimiti copilul intr o excursie costa in jur de 15 euro in ziua aia tin minte ca eu plingeam din afara autocarului oana din autocar ca de ce o trimit dar asa a prins repede limba si s a imprietenit cu copiii de acolo apoi colegele ei veneau sa doarma la noi am avut foarte multi italieni care au dormit sub acoperisul unui roman si nu au fost probleme oamenii din sicilia sint prietenosi si calzi cu toate acestea eu nu ma simteam atit de bine sa ma duc in vizita la un italian oricit de dragut si binevoitor ar fi unii ne trateaza ca pe niste sclavi
8440012 a fost la cursuri de ceramica dansuri teatru asa cum este educatia in romania nu cred ca o sa i ajungem niciodata pe italieni
8440013 cu ciubote am plecat in ciubote m am intors in acesti 4 ani cit am fost eu plecata din care doi ani i am petrecut cu familia in italia am reusit sa stringem bani pentru a darima o casa si a face alta in loc este intr adevar ceva mai mult nu ne trebuie italia te imbolnaveste
8440014 acest dosar trebuie intocmit in dublu exemplar unul ramine la noi altul este trimis la ministerul educatiei

8440155 st stanislaus has been co operating with the police completely and the principal informed parents of the allegations long before they came to the attention of the media father devitt said
8440156 sexual physical and mental abuse occurs in families and has been associated with all faiths and institutions

8440329 if i had to say where i thought the problem was id say it was in having us train six newbies before moving on we could probably get by with training four or five instead
8440330 still thats because we are good trainers there are some people out here that still struggle to survive after two years i would hate to train with them i guess the bottom line is if you can survive out here for a year you must know what you are doing

8440341 but there is still a lot to learn perhaps by the time you are a medic you will be ready the ability to bi locate is the key to the entire process when you have learned how to do that you will be ready in the meantime you will continue within the program itself as ron and rachels son they will be watching you in the hopes that you will have the same abilities that your parents did they will give you as much training as possible before they attempt to use you it is almost certain you will be chosen to be trained for federation time travel

8440398 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia

8440409 marti seara a fost o sedinta a consiliului de administratie a clubului care a analizat situatia existenta un membru al ca nu va pot spune numele lui a propus sa nu ne prezentam la cluj si chiar retragerea echipei din campionat motivele modul in care poli a fost arbitrata in primele patru etape si situatia aparuta la meciul cu farul lucruri care l au facut sa creada ca nu sintem doriti in liga i eu m am opus insa daca nu se decide disputarea partidei cu constanta cred ca se merge pina la capat mai mult acel domn a primit dreptate si din partea altor membri ai ca care au spus ca nu e normal ca o echipa de oficiali care primesc 25 000 lei la un singur meci disputat acasa sa nu si faca datoria
8440410 cazul va fi discutat vineri ca urmare a unei solicitari de aminare a judecarii venita din partea farului consider ca este o lipsa mare de fair play din partea constantenilor care tergiverseaza lucrurile toata lumea ne da dreptate numai ei incearca prin orice metode sa evite disputarea jocului si sa cistige nemeritat la masa verde

8440412 patru ani am demonstrat ca sintem o echipa de luptatori sint sigur ca vom rearata in scurt timp acelasi lucru si vom obtine in scurt timp rezultate favorabile indiferent de numele adversarului indiferent de cum sintem arbitrati si la cluj va fi greu pentru ca jucam impotriva campioanei o echipa care cu suma de transfer si salariul unui jucator acopera salariile intregului nostru club pe un an insa nimic nu e imposibil

8440415 the debate over cost keeps getting forgotten but government should remember that the goal is to prevent climate change and we need to ask what is the cheapest way of doing that
8440416 in that light it is clear first generation biofuels are far too expensive
8440417 we cant tackle climate change in a world where tropical deforestation continues and there is now plenty of evidence that demand for energy crops is exacerbating that problem
8440418 pushing for effective sustainability standards for biofuels and for eu policy to be reviewed in light of any emerging evidence
8440419 i would rather pay 5 to a forestry project in borneo than around 200 to a farmer in the us producing biofuels
8440420 we are paying lots of different groups to change the way they behave and the products they produce so we might as well target the most cost effective

8440428 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8440429 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8440430 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8440431 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8440432 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8440433 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8440434 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that
8440435 it hasnt progressed to the point where were in serious discussions with the team
8440436 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8440437 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8440438 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8440439 i thought i was going to get my dress really dirty that was my biggest concern
8440440 i would have loved to take a nap on the court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8440441 its an amazing feeling i just play much more confident
8440442 we had just left templetons crossing and had walked up over the top of mt bellamy and were coming back down to the next camp ground when some of the hikers stopped to take photos of the natural canopy above the trail
8440443 one of them zoomed in on what appeared to be a body he had zoomed in on it and when the wind blew you could see what looked like a body and it appeared to be hanging by a cable
8440444 i couldnt make it out at first it was quite high up about 12 to 15 metres then the wind blew again and i saw it move
8440445 it appears to be sitting in an aluminium harness and hanging from a cable which leads us to believe it could be an airman
8440446 if it is a body then its a very significant find there will be a family somewhere who had a family member missing in action who might be able to put that person to rest

8440450 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8440451 i love comfort and ease i think you aussies are great at that
8440452 i like to walk by the store and have something catch my eye and then go in but i dont like to do the whole hour long im not a girl girl in that way

8440454 kj has been located but we are still looking for azaria
8440455 we should disclose that the band has been going through some hard times recently
8440456 these hard times are both as a band and as individuals
8440457 working on the new record was the final breaking point for an already unstable band
8440458 regardless of what happened jess and azaria are still very close mates and were planning to catch up in the us
8440459 this has never happened before and its been a long time coming
8440460 the international community should talk about how to bring democracy to burma and focus on the constitution and the elections
8440461 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8440462 i remember when you were here how youd let me sit when you wanted something
8440463 its been many years since youve been back what could you possibly want from me
8440464 easily enough vhaar i just want the bounty on my head dropped i dont want to deal with it anymore i dont want to have to worry about my back anymore rynn shadowlore is again dead as are his generals pythax and borgal tombah has perished as well zarron has his father back and galdur has ascended everything has turned around in my life im tired of looking over my shoulder im tired of this inferno
8440465 for the last month and a half ive been constantly attacked by demons and vampires i was happy enjoying what little peace i found in the mortal world when they suddenly came
8440466 the savage mountains are as fierce and perilous as ever and i nearly died multiple times but through adversity we find ourselves
8440467 i can sense that power has returned to you raamok
8440468 i had intended to until i found out you were my successor i see you have done well i couldnt have asked for a better turn out
8440469 i cannot usurp you i trained you i created you
8440470 id step down if you were to return my liege
8440471 you remember why i left vhaar you remember how weak i became as the struggle within me escalated which is why i chose you thats why i molded you all i came for was the bounty i realized that the underworld is no longer a place of solace for me ive fought this war for over a millennia and finally im free of it i leave it in great hands
8440472 i will look into this bounty thing raamok i just ask that you stick around until than
8440473 the quarters i used when i was your consort will be made readily available for your convenience ill call for you when ive learned something
8440474 id hate to have to kill someone i put so much time into molding
8440475 no zarron raamok needs to find himself i cannot take this from him he needs to do what he needs to do to maintain an equilibrium hell return when hes ready
8440476 zarron how long has he been fighting by your side
8440477 exactly he wouldnt throw that away to again claim permanent dominance over the underworld raamok hated that place
8440478 true i just hope that he hurries because stacy is only mortal
8440479 shes the reason raamok is in the state hes in
8440480 aye and its because of that reason that he doesnt believe he should be able to see her again raamok feels unnaturally responsible for the events of the past month or so and especially the fact that her life was placed on the line raamok feels that he shouldnt be allowed to talk to her again
8440481 he mentioned it after you guys left thats not the point though the point is that he wont go to her
8440482 she wants to talk to him though itd be rude if he didnt hear her out
8440483 he could call in a favor from the gods you could bat for him
8440484 no can do he called in a pretty tall one with his stepping down to join the mortal realm
8440485 yep shed need to find an immortal being with which she could latch onto so dont get your hopes up
8440486 i looked into the bounty thing and i did indeed cancel the contract that was out on you
8440487 looks like there is a revolution in the mix than
8440488 someone reissued the hit in hopes that id come looking to kill you thereby opening the gates for someone to seize power
8440489 yes we i want it stopped you want the bounties gone we work together and well accomplish the task considerably faster
8440490 though if youd just tell people im dead and therefore the bounty is no longer relevant thatd work too
8440491 what are you talking about thats exactly what it means how daft are you this is the underworld were talking about
8440492 he cannot love you he wont age whereas in a few decades you will be dead
8440493 i know this i just need to talk to him i i dont even know how i feel towards him its just
8440494 well its a different world arent there ways to attain immortality
8440495 be appointed by the gods or to merge your spirit with one who is already immortal
8440496 someone needs to plead your case or they must determine of their own that youre worthy
8440497 he may however hes recently had a favor granted by the gods
8440498 both galdur and myself have both recently been granted favors as well were it to happen youd have to merge with someone
8440499 im leaving again soon vhaar is the current overlord and i have no desire to usurp her a revolution is stirring though my brother
8440500 why not itll be a good way to try and find myself and plus its vhaar i cant just leave her to dry
8440501 just cuz shes a demon doesnt mean she cant have feelings
8440502 my brother shes only using you she seeks your power for this fight and then shell turn on you
8440503 i only came back to tell you and galdur that im going to help vhaar fight an attempt to usurp her
8440504 and she probably just wants to thank you for saving her life i think shes pretty smitten by you as well
8440505 i just want to thank you for saving my life
8440506 dont worry about it you shouldnt have been in that predicament in the first place i was obligated to do it
8440507 oh hey i was talking to zarron and he said that if i could find someone immortal i could merge with them or something to that effect
8440508 its possible but why would you want to i can tell you from personal experience that its not the best thing to do
8440509 its a constant struggle as the two halves of you continually vie for dominance of the body not only that but finding someone is very difficult why would you even want to
8440510 because i want to see more of this world i want to be able to spend time in it learning and i want to be with you as well
8440511 anyways i guess ill see what i can do but i really need to get going i have some things to take care of first
8440512 youre a demon vhaar there is no emotion within you only the thought of bettering your situation this this does nothing to help you whats your goal
8440513 i gain you as a consort and i gain your power your protection
8440514 vhaar im here to help you quell this rebellion and nothing more
8440515 tell me raamok that you can walk away from the thought of being with me
8440516 vhaar what we would have is nothing more than a relationship devoid of any real meaning
8440517 if you want them both than you have to do something to show me your conviction
8440518 as a way to keep your sanity find a way to maintain an equilibrium between the two of you allow yourself to do what demons do battle seduce destroy let her do what humans do feel contemplate nurture otherwise you will only do what i did for a millennia
8440519 let us quell this rebellion first than we will consider this
8440520 the rebellion is not a serious threat my proposition to you is this either attain the soul and have what you say you sought or dont in either event i want the answer before we fight off this rebellion
8440521 than i will help you to kill the instigator than we will say our good byes
8440522 if you agree than you will do it and i will stay here with you
8440523 yes but i need you to understand that if you go through with this you and her will share the same body she will be inside your human body and you inside her demon body
8440524 the only suggestion i can make to you is that when things of battle or war are approached you leave them to her and she in turn will leave those concepts of humanity to you
8440525 are you sure this is what you want the process is reversible but ridiculously painful
8440526 stacy if you merge with her there is no battle youll be one and the same
8440527 think of it this way you love my human half and vhaar loves my demon half
8440528 well im sorry zarron i just thought this ceremony would bore you
8440529 im gonna give you a few days to clear your minds to find the cohesion you will undoubtedly need in the future

8440565 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process
8440566 they could then secede from the united states and then we might have another civil war
8440567 they have an allegiance to mexico where they were taught the u s fought an unjust war with mexico and took this territory

8440701 only time will tell with that one there are a lot of things that go into it what we think about the guys we have and things like that sometimes finances get involved so you just take each situation differently and day by day and see
8440702 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8440703 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8440704 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8440705 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8440706 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8440707 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8440708 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8440712 spammers and malware authors are able to break captcha process
8440713 as a result weve seen an increase in the amount of mail sent out from reputable mail services such as gmail hotmail and windows live mail and an increase in the number of blogs that host malicious content or content that the spammers wish to advertise
8440714 many attackers have found creative ways to entice humans to unknowingly solve the captchas for them
8440715 this relay attack involves copying the image served in a captcha to a user somewhere else having them solve the captcha and then copying their response back to the original website
8440716 were seeing more captchas targeted more captchas broken i dont see how the targeting by the malicious authors right now is going to go away its still in their interests to get hold of these valued accounts
8440717 we are updating our captcha system to be both more readable for customers but more difficult to break through
8440718 improvements include new image distortion logic overlapping characters and dynamic monitoring capabilities to observe attacks in real time and make necessary adjustments to mitigate them in addition we continue to make advances to better prevent spammers from using hotmail accounts once created to successfully send spam
8440719 the huge increase in numbers of legitimate sites affected radically changes traditional trust relationships on the web
8440720 steering clear of dubious sites has always been sound advice but steering clear of legitimate sites is not an option
8440721 theres probably going to have to be some kind of layered security
8440722 its up to the industry sectors which and how many layers of security they wish to employ dependent on what sort of site they have
8440723 ultimately captchas are useless for spam because theyre designed to tell you if someone is human or not but not whether something is spam or not just because something came from a real human being doesnt mean it isnt spam which is why content based solutions like akismet are the only long term solution to the spam problem

8440748 in acest moment nu mai exista posibilitatea ca la nici un meci din liga i indiferent ca este un derby sa arbitreze o brigada straina
8440749 deocamdata arbitrii romani nu au dat motive sa fie banuiti de parti prix uri
8440750 nu este un moft de al meu faptul ca nu vreau arbitri straini in liga i dar la inceputul campionatului cca a luat o hotarire care a fost aprobata de comitetul executiv al frf prin care s a precizat clar ca pina la sfirsitul campionatului se va conta numai pe arbitri romani

8440777 yknow folks after reading all the comments i have auto envy now
8440778 any post that would cause sandra miller to comment with
8440779 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8440780 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8440781 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8440782 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8440783 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8440791 were not going to twist anyones hands to make them support recognition
8440792 we are ever confident that it the transfer will get done but i think we have always said it will go to the wire
8440793 we will keep moving it along and we would hope that he will be coming to join us at chelsea
8440794 robinhos time in spain has come to an end he is looking forward to being part of a new project
8440795 there were two players that he really identified one was deco and one was robinho
8440796 i think weve already seen the impact that deco has made on the premier league and weve certainly seen the impact he has made with us
8440797 if we get robinho i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without him but with him its just that added dimension
8440798 ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything i have scored goals won two leagues and that isnt easy i think my period at real madrid has come to an end
8440799 so i know that theres the chinese the japanese and the koreans now which one are you or are you both of the three that i just said
8440800 oh my goodness im sorry i forgot about the phillipines you one of them huh
8440801 ohhh so you is one of them chinese except yous just a different kind of chinese
8440802 yes we are mongolians thank you felix can you pass me the salt
8440803 yeah one time i put that up there and this girl came in late and saw it on the board and left i had to chase after her down the hall to tell her she was in the right place

8440805 scope easy and efficient parallel processing of massive data sets
8440806 scope has a strong resemblance to sql an intentional design choice users familiar with sql require little or no training to use scope like sql data is modeled as a set of rows composed of typed columns every rowset has a well defined schema it allows users to focus on the data transformations required to solve the problem at hand and hides the complexity of the underlying platform and implementation details
8440807 extractors for parsing and constructing rows from a file processors for row wise processing reducers for group wise processing and combiners for combining rows from two inputs all of which allow users to solve problems that cannot easily be expressed in traditional sql
8440808 americans recognize that neither john mccain nor barack obama are agents of change in this country
8440809 senators mccain and obama are the remnants of a political establishment that has failed the american people and will continue to do so as long as voters give them a chance
8440810 liberals who are tired of the democratic party acting as a doormat to the governments assault against civil liberties
8440811 and conservatives who are tired of the republican partys reckless abandonment of fiscal responsibility are all potential barr voters
8440812 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8440813 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8440814 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8440815 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant
8440816 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years
8440817 in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8440818 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8440819 if we had a secret we would have written a book and made a million dollars
8440820 we love each other we have similar interests our lives were very similar even before we met
8440821 i think today marriage as an institution has been strengthened
8440822 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men
8440823 im not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton everyday
8440824 i just think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by such antics
8440825 ive let previous comments like this pass and i wasnt gonna stand for it anymore ive spent my entire adult life working for democratic causes and candidates and im not gonna have my credentials challenged
8440826 every cloud has a side there is someting worse always
8440827 twenty20 cricket will it ruin test cricket i dont think so
8440828 i really do think that the basic fundamentals of the game are still the same
8440829 we survived world series cricket 30 years ago it is a game that does have the ability to mutate to come in different forms short long energetic some may say slow boring relaxing whatever your take is it does have the ability to evolve and turn itself around
8440830 there are a lot of issues that cricket faces at the moment not just the twenty20 not just the ipl
8440831 i believe they india account for about 80 of world cricket revenue its a reasonably strong position to be in one would think as a business
8440832 so how do they how does the icc and the cricket world manage that not deal with it but manage it because its real and its happening and fair play to them theres immense passion for the game there and a great love for it
8440833 and that his modesty and integrity was of the very highest order
8440834 until those dates are out i havent really thought about any decision

8440866 they took her in for a psychological test i was told to wait outside
8440867 then they gave me something to sign and i signed it said she was mentally retarded but i had no idea what that meant
8440868 but that doesnt make up for the years shes lost the years when you learn to read write and count i cant even send her shopping all she can do now is manual work
8440869 in the first grade in a normal school the kids can count to 20 here they can only count to five although we want to teach them numbers up to 10
8440870 normally the children would learn this at fourth grade but these kids keep forgetting things so you have to keep repeating them
8440871 i blame the parents they dont read to their kids the roma have no appreciation that you have to apply yourself to get on they just live for the day
8440872 we cant say to those who teach like this you have to go that would lead to a collapse of the school system
8440873 i want to see in two years that teachers in schools with a high percentage of roma children have appropriate training and i want to see a major shift in these schools but i cant say tomorrow you have to change the philosophy youve been teaching with for 20 years
8440874 i wasnt at a special school because my parents were strict with me
8440875 czech people are racist and xenophobic but many gypsies are worse they dont send their kids to school because they dont want them to be white its a big mistake we can talk about racism but we live in a democratic country and everyone can make choices
8440876 they send us their children and we try to send them back to a normal school but they like to have their kids in schools where the other sinti are
8440877 the parents of many of the children in special or sub standard schools are themselves the products of a discriminatory educational environment that will affect their childrens chances
8440878 so there are problems within many affected communities but the principal burden rests on government to make clear that discrimination must end

8440893 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
8440894 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
8440895 at the time of the alleged decision in 2003 to concoct the false letter the vice presidents office had been reportedly pressuring the cia to prove this connection as a justification to invade iraq
8440896 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
8440897 the law specifically provides that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
8440898 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
8440899 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
8440900 i asked chairman conyers to investigate these claims because if true the administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war
8440901 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
8440902 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
8440903 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
8440904 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
8440905 my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
8440906 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
8440907 i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found
8440908 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr suskind in his book i do speak to discussions regarding using habbush which were frequent during that period but what i was talking about was the possibility of using him to tamp down the insurgency not to influence western public opinion
8440909 the fabrication of a letter as claimed by mr suskind would have been much more than a non event
8440910 an order such as the one outlined by mr suskind would have been a huge event and in my opinion illegal an order to fabricate such a document would have been rejected out of hand and it is improbable to believe anyone would write such a request
8440911 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
8440912 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda
8440913 richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
8440914 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
8440915 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
8440916 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
8440917 with the population exploding and the corrections budget ever smaller prison conditions within the states department of corrections have deteriorated dramatically in recent years
8440918 there has been no accountability to the taxpayers who fund the system the employees who work in the prisons or the individuals who are incarcerated in them

8440937 i really do feel that the broader community will be missing out if access is cut
8440938 we think if everyone sat down and talked we could come up with a compromise that would suit both sides

8440991 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8440992 the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilization of the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead

8441012 networking is a huge part of this industry and the trend to me seems that the more you do of it the more successful you are
8441013 communities like the gay board provide a place for people working in the same market to exchange ideas set up business deals and meet others working in their space
8441014 but not everyone is drawn to one community many people hop around a lot until they find a place they feel they can call home

8441021 formally nominated by michael wilson of florida a republican and air force medic and veteran of iraq
8441022 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort a president who can adapt to new situations as things change instead of being stuck in the past
8441023 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8441024 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8441030 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8441031 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8441032 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8441033 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8441034 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8441035 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8441036 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8441037 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8441038 youre lucky i didnt knock the f k out of you
8441039 hillary clinton should be the nominee and barack should have waited his turn instead he ruined our shot at 16 years in the white house
8441040 were calling for all of us forces to be withdrawn from iraq both parties need to be held accountable to bring an immediate end to the war
8441041 i thought that we were there to free the iraqi people and to win their hearts and minds i dont think thats whats happening
8441042 hes going to be seeking out the trouble as opposed to reacting to trouble when it happens one of his main motivations for going to the daily planet was to be somewhere where the information comes in
8441043 hes going to be much more on patrol than he was ever in his life and hes really stepping up in a big way to his destiny
8441044 the feel of the show is going to be a lot more metropolis this year
8441045 theres an episode where jimmy will think he sees something and starts connecting it to clark and clark has to dig himself out of it that starts clark thinking that maybe it would be wise to have a secret identity he starts embracing the idea that theres someone out there saving people hes not denying that completely anymore hes just not ready to tell anyone its him and that makes this year very exciting for us
8441046 erica durance and tom have such a great chemistry on camera together as lois and clark i just love seeing the dailies theyre going to be butting heads a lot as usual theyll be teaming up on stories and getting into the typical hijinks together
8441047 it wont be that drastic but youre not that far off
8441048 clark is getting past it hes not mulling over it too much hes learned his lessons and its time for him to move forward but of course when lana shows up in person that makes things a lot more complicated for him
8441049 maxima is the intergalactic goddess who needs to mate and humans just dont fill the bill the way that we portray her one of her powers is skill at making herself irresistible to the men who come upon her and clark will not be immune to that theres going to be one episode but were hoping to do more than one charlotte sullivan is the actress we cast and she did a really great job shes really interesting
8441050 sam is fantastic hes doing a really great job playing a guy whos sort of the tortured supervillian
8441051 tess is definitely interested in him and who wouldnt be
8441052 cassidy freeman is also doing an incredible job nobody could fill michael rosenbaums shoes completely but shes carrying the mantle as best as i can imagine anybody doing it
8441053 her appearance was great but the story that we told with her seemed to come to a natural ending point for the time being
8441054 thats an episode that we will find out a lot about oliver and his past and clark and chloe will work together to save him
8441055 its three superheroes saturn girl cosmic boy and lightning lad although we might not use those names on a mission from superman in the future who sends them back to help make things right

8441129 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8441130 if one espouses the belief that the more the number of competitors the lower the price one could assume from that that with this high concentration of refiners in canada that we are paying a higher price at the wholesale level
8441131 while it may be of little consolation to canadians the volatility we have recently witnessed is not unique to canada
8441132 what is unique to canada is that notwithstanding this turbulence canadians pay the second lowest price in the western world for petroleum fuels
8441133 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8441134 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8441135 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
8441136 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
8441137 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
8441138 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
8441139 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8441140 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities
8441141 even if your manager has the sense to tell you to use your discretion and judgment if you think you want to take a quick stroll through the plant youre often not going to have the time to do it anyway
8441142 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8441143 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8441144 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8441145 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty
8441146 i think everybody understands that canada has no particular power play here this is in the interests of order and also in the interests of environmental protection
8441147 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8441148 for the most part the countries that are going into the arctic right now are co operating
8441149 its the new companies coming into the arctic that could be a concern mandatory registration will force new ones to comply
8441150 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8441151 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8441152 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8441153 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8441155 if not collected the used oil is generally thrown down drains
8441156 it eventually finds its way to treatment plants and oil is one of the most difficult products to treat and eliminate at those plants so using spent oil to produce biodiesel is environmentally friendly to an extremely high degree
8441157 first there is a limited supply of used oil and not all the oil used is collected the second reason is that it takes a far greater amount of technology and investment to produce acceptable biodiesel from used oil than from virgin oil
8441158 so we not only purchase from other collectors but are now also engaged in the acquisition of several collection companies
8441159 biodiesel was the answer and thats what we founded the company to do
8441160 this is an industry that works with environmental concerns so we have to start by setting an example ourselves major environmental impacts include for example the water used in the process this water has a chemical demand for oxygen of 15 000 ppm and before it can be discharged into the river it has to be brought down to 100 which is a major challenge the other two main points are reduction of water consumption by re using water to minimise clean water intake and process improvements to reduce our consumption of catalysts and methanol which are both expensive and highly contaminating
8441161 the biggest challenge is to take that permanent heterogeneity and turn it into a standard fine end product

8441404 dazzled by the apparatus of fame and the appearance of access to power
8441405 you have to keep a sense of proportion about it all
8441406 i still remember as a child my uncle leo warning me not to become big headed and my grandmother saying paul kennedy you werent put on this earth to have it easy it was very salutary and still means a lot to me
8441407 it is very seductive to be asked to speak to the world economic forum at davos or to the agm of the asian bankers association in bangkok
8441408 commercial agencies could have you lecturing every week in palm beach to conferences of realtors or investment bankers but the danger is that you lose your bearings and fail to renew yourself intellectually your thesis becomes passe and you risk becoming boring and bored with the same talk
8441409 i do about three or four big commercial lectures a year no more
8441410 they tend to coincide with times when the car needs repairing or a child is going to college
8441411 said that he couldnt understand why people were so excited about it it seemed to him a very basic and rather conventional great powers book and he thought i should have been looking at larger long term global trends
8441412 they shouted the poor guy down but when i was going back on the train i thought about what had been said and realised that he had a very good point it was then that i started building up the files that would lead on to a subsequent book preparing for the twenty first century
8441413 we know a huge amount about the war in terms of the people at the top
8441414 and an increasing amount about the experience of the common man or woman
8441415 when i speak to my students they understandably tend to think that churchill and roosevelt ordered these things and they just happened but the war went very badly for most of 1943 things had to be turned round and im interested in the people who werent at the top or the bottom of the war effort but somewhere in the middle who made that possible
8441416 the war in the air was being lost for most of 1943 and 12 months after casablanca the bombing of germany had stopped
8441417 its potential was spotted by a couple of test pilots from rolls royce who flew it in april 1942 but the problem was that the american engine was underpowered they came up with the solution of dropping in one of the new merlin engines and suddenly it worked
8441418 but it then took a huge battle to get the change of engine accepted it is a story of how things got done that changed the course of the war and there are a number of stories like it that are very little known
8441419 it is a lesson for the people who run organisations military or otherwise that you must allow room for experiments and for eccentrics for the man in the middle of the organisation who solves things when i tell this to scientists or business people they get it straight away
8441420 kipling is hard to avoid if youre interested in imperial history
8441421 and he has always fascinated me he was a significant anticipator even though he is known as the bard of empire he was very concerned about british imperial decline he was also remarkable in writing in so many different genres there are people you think of as poets or novelists but kipling was more akin to a musician such as haydn working across the whole range of his art
8441422 since bush started his adventure in iraq youll find a vast increase in the number of google hits on kipling and all of his major works
8441423 the big one for american conservatives is the white mans burden which makes them very uneasy it can seem triumphalist with its talk of child nations but then you hit stanza five which warns that theyll never like you theyll soon want you out and dont believe theyll ever be grateful it is very contemporary
8441424 kipling for iraq dummies or a full scale biography there are already about six really fabulous biographies and theres no point in competing with them
8441425 picking up the threads of intellectual interests that had buzzed in the back of my mind for years
8441426 the possibility exists of doing a second edition in 2010 but i havent decided exactly how to do it if i rewrite that final chapter will readers wonder what it was in the 1988 book that caused such a stir
8441427 it was the year when the world economic forum was held in new york
8441428 everybody there read the first six paragraphs and was then interrupted by bumping into somebody they wanted to talk to
8441429 there is no point in denying that the 1990s worked very beneficially for the united states
8441430 but the underlying long term point remained the same and has certainly not lost its force in the 2000s
8441431 one element in that enjoyment is indulging in passions old churches ordnance survey maps and good pubs but there is also much to be positive about and i find the current mood difficult to understand although it clearly takes something from the gloom of the london tabloids
8441432 im hugely impressed by the strength in depth of the british academic world it extends well beyond traditional places such as oxford cambridge and london
8441433 there are places such as york manchester edinburgh and sussex that are stunningly good there is too much bureaucracy and too few resources but both the productivity and quality are astonishingly high
8441434 the bulk of jon sudbos scientific publications are invalid due to the fabrication and manipulation of the underlying data material
8441435 the long history of research misconduct all over the world tells us that university internal investigation is essentially a sham
8441436 there are odd instances where internal investigations are plausible but they are in circumstances where the system itself is not challenged for instance a phd student who fiddles some results might be dealt with effectively or even brutally
8441437 but as soon as other issues are involved the reputation of the institution itself and the reputation of powerful academics or commercial interests these investigations tend to descend into farce
8441438 there are many people who have fought against this definition and argue that research misconduct is anything done intentionally that distorts or threatens to distort the scientific record
8441439 its like defining murder based on the mechanism of death rather than the act of deliberate killing you might define murder as stabbing someone with a knife as hitting someone over the head or as running someone over with a car then suddenly you have a problem if someone kills by poisoning thats not murder because it doesnt fit with your restrictive definition
8441440 we looked at universities procedures and many would not have survived attacks from anybody legally represented they are not fit for purpose
8441441 the individuals involved in the formation of the ukpri have written clearly about the problems yet we ended up with the formation of a body that is structurally incapable of addressing them
8441442 usually the easiest thing to do is give the fraudster a good reference and get him to move on elsewhere i know department heads and professors who were given good references to move on when they were suspected of fraud
8441443 we are led to believe that university research is free of bias because that is what universities tell us
8441444 so industry gets universities to do its research and both sides know that industry pays over the odds by paying well over the odds for the research industry keeps the department on side
8441445 i get the impression as an experienced medical editor that there is often a concerted attempt to bury bad news for obvious reasons universities dont like to be exposed as dens of vice and corruption
8441446 weve also come across institutions that just dont know what to do its not a question of brushing it under the carpet because they dont have any brushes or carpets there is a sort of bewilderment and an ignoring of the problem in the hope that it will go away
8441447 one of the unsatisfactory things that cope discovered when we analysed eight years of work was that in about half the cases when an editor had reported a case to an institution we never really got a resolution it wasnt that they told us to get lost it was just that the editors changed letters got lost and so on and that was disappointing
8441448 within six months they produced a report they had exposed him as a fraud they had stripped him of his right to practise fired him from his jobs and written to all the journals to retract the articles which i think was fantastic i dont think anything like that could happen here
8441449 where self regulation is practised fairly and run on the right principles it can work well
8441450 such systems often have limitations about which allegations can be considered this might be limited to research that is funded by the national research funder and allegations can be presented only by researchers of a certain standing
8441451 what about other misconduct in research supported by other funders is this investigated to a different standard
8441452 the other part of the equation is taking things out of context away from an organisation that has expertise in the field and greater awareness of local factors it is important that an individual has a fair hearing
8441453 the reputations of universities are based on having sound and fair principles for research integrity
8441454 it might sound simplistic that by giving someone a manual you can facilitate a complex investigation but i believe having the right procedure to follow will help organisations take investigations forward appropriately particularly the ability of universities to access expert advice when needed
8441455 what has to be recognised is that each individual university is the employer of the people who do the research and it is the university who holds the research grant
8441456 so i think its the university sector that has to take responsibility for the issue we have made huge strides in recent years when it comes to ethical approval of research projects before they start and i see the move towards a more co ordinated approach to research integrity as being the next step
8441457 plagiarism seems to be a pathetic crime perpetuated by the weak because its easy to do
8441458 people must hope they can get away with it and the vast majority of them probably do we get regular complaints of plagiarised papers some of our members would say that sometimes plagiarism is acceptable
8441459 we get the impression that sometimes younger researchers and clinicians are more puzzled by the concept of plagiarism because theyve been brought up at school writing essays by using the internet they see material on the internet as being freely available and that anyone can use it the idea that there can be ownership of information is somewhat puzzling for some people
8441460 is the editor of a journal really going to phone up professor x and say what did you really do i dont think its terribly likely
8441461 i remember telephoning a famous professor because i had been sent a paper for my journal with his name on and there was something in it that puzzled me so i rang and he said what paper and when i told him he clearly had no knowledge of it at all
8441462 what could i do take his name off the embarrassment would have been enormous so i let it go
8441463 it makes a lot of work a human being still has to look at the percentage of material that overlaps and to decide how much of that is benign the software just picks out words and phrases that match but doesnt express an opinion about them
8441464 we might use it when we think hmm that looks a bit fishy then it can be a tool you can use to do work that might otherwise take several hours
8441465 but we dont make the judgment call its up to the people using the database to decide if the material is plagiarised we now have recruitment committees emailing us asking if applicants for positions have any entries
8441466 as we see it the advantage of our system is that a judge has expertise in looking at evidence in complex cases if a judge presides over the committee then perhaps there will be less scepticism about its impartiality
8441467 congress felt that universities didnt have an incentive to go out and investigate misconduct rigorously there has now been enough research to suggest there is good reason to believe universities dont do as good a job if you leave them to their own devices
8441468 i think the uk ought to take a harder look at what needs to be done i would say the uk is 20 years behind our system
8441469 there is enormous pressure to do research to advance in medicine and because of that pressure there could be the potential for bending the rules
8441470 we had a discussion about how prevalent the problem was and then i went to do a search to see what had been done on it there were a couple of studies from the us so i decided to see if the results were relevant in the uk among my peers
8441471 i want to know who i was in my past life
8441472 very well before you came to earth you were a seraphim a being of the six wings the highest order of angel
8441473 normally that is so but you and three others were elites the best of the best and because of that you four were given special permission and privileges to get your jobs done
8441474 you mean i we gave up our wings and being in heaven to come here
8441475 i know not your orders were to stay hidden and under the radar till the opportunity arose itself
8441476 i feel your power look at my face i am becoming jobama your faithful sidekick
8441477 he changed egypt by getting them all to be monotheistic
8441478 obama will obviously change america by making us all of one mind
8441479 we are concerned additionally that this endeavor could reinforce among the public a perception that the universitys faculty lacks intellectual and ideological diversity
8441480 the goal of the institute is to build on the universitys existing leadership position and make the milton friedman institute a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world
8441481 the milton friedman institute will continue chicagos extraordinary tradition of creating new ideas that stimulate the academic world and innovative approaches that influence policy
8441482 some colleagues are disturbed by the specter of the university of chicago becoming another stanford with the milton friedman institute taking on the imposing campus presence of the hoover institution
8441483 i wonder if this foray is really just a matter of money i really do not think the dissenting faculty members think they can win divestment from milton friedman but i think they do believe they are playing for more investment for their own politicized causes
8441484 the first thing we do lets kill all the lawyers
8441485 dont take a chance with free speech because it might constitute harassment or in any event it might get you a lawsuit
8441486 notre dame vs the klan how the fighting irish defeated the ku klux klan
8441487 since no adverse disciplinary action was taken and no information regarding the investigation was placed in your personnel file we therefore consider this matter closed
8441488 people use this to trash affirmative action im uncomfortable with that
8441489 support and defend the constitution of the united states and the constitution of the state of california against all enemies foreign and domestic
8441490 take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion
8441491 seemingly innocuous oaths with their demand for symbolic gestures of loyalty subtly squelch political dissent
8441492 compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard
8441493 while abuses occur on many campuses red alert campuses have policies and or practices that pose a particularly dangerous threat to basic freedoms
8441494 they are the worst of the worst when it comes to liberty on campus
8441495 i will insist that my one niece and three nephews who are native coloradoans and who i will soon be assisting with their college education do not even consider cc as an option what a disgrace to colorado i wish the word colorado werent even in the name of the university you lead
8441496 colorado college has been and continues to be committed to safeguarding the free speech and safety of its students
8441497 thank you to the foundation for individual rights in education fire a watchdog organization over campus free speech around the country
8441498 expressions deemed inappropriate that has been refined by fgcu to mean violence or direct threats of violence or verbal assault
8441499 offensive or demeaning language or treatment of an individual where such language is based typically on prejudicial treatment
8441500 w e have recognized that the university is a traditional sphere of free expression so fundamental to the functioning of our society that the governments ability to control speech within that sphere by means of conditions attached to the expenditure of government funds is restricted by the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines of the first amendment
8441501 the precedents of this court leave no room for the view that because of the acknowledged need for order first amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large
8441502 with respect to persons entitled to be there our cases leave no doubt that the first amendment rights of speech and association extend to the campuses of state universities
8441503 is one that a reasonable person would objectively find hostile or abusive or one that the particular person who is the object of the harassment perceives to be hostile or abusive
8441504 schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use
8441505 students speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission
8441506 there is a difference between the extent that a school may regulate student speech in a public university setting as opposed to that of a public elementary or high school
8441507 d iscussion by adult students in a college classroom should not be restricted
8441508 must always remain free to inquire to study and to evaluate to gain new maturity and understanding otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die
8441509 i agree with those who think that the best response to offensive speech is not to curtail it forcibly
8441510 but to condemn it and explain why it is wrong
8441511 no law school rule imposes limits on the content of publications by students that would be applicable here
8441512 speech or conduct of a sexual nature that i is
8441513 emphasis added this and other provisions in the code seemed directly aimed at any future repetition of humor akin to the frug parody
8441514 prohibiting the portrayal of actual students and perhaps professors altogether and implementing an opt in opt out system whereby students could choose to be parodied or not
8441515 the parody plans to take consideration of all suggestions in their re examination of the parody going forward
8441516 and plans to address any concerns brought up by the hls community in the future
8441517 many students commented on the need for greater discussions on race gender and sexuality at hls beyond the parody context and this open forum was a starting point for productive discussions to come
8441518 fictitious reference to a priest caught fooling around with a woman during the screening of
8441519 and a cartoon depicting a brawl between the former and current university presidents the university changed the door locks of the newspaper office and removed all remaining copies of the spoof from campus according to the schools web site the
8441520 opportunity for students really to explore and learn and apply what they have experienced in a classroom or what they may have an interest in doing in a real setting
8441521 targeted black students on the basis of their race subjected them to ridicule and embarrassment intimidated them and had a deleterious impact on their growth and well being on campus
8441522 targeted members of the tufts muslim community for harassment and embarrassment
8441523 t he appeal of the political cartoon or caricature is often based on exploitation of unfortunate physical traits or politically embarrassing events an exploitation often calculated to injure the feelings of the subject of the portrayal
8441524 the art of the cartoonist is often not reasoned or evenhanded but slashing and one sided
8441525 from the viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have been considerably poorer without
8441526 expressive visual or physical conduct that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individuals work educational performance or status or has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating hostile or offensive environment
8441527 the district court properly decided that appellants former policy was unconstitutional and that the policy if permitted to stand would abridge temple students right to free speech and contribute to the nationwide problem of censorship on campus
8441528 discussion by adult students in a college classroom should not be restricted
8441529 hopefully other courts across the country will take mondays ruling as real guidepost for restoring first amendment rights
8441530 it had nothing to do with his first amendment rights and had everything to do with temple professors academic freedom to grade a students poorly written poorly constructed thesis
8441531 no reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against mr sampson this means i asked a school spokesman that mr sampson could have been reading about the adventures of jack and jill and he still would have been charged yes what then was the offense harassing behavior while reading the book the question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone for good reason and well removed from all semblance of reason what the behavior was one learned could never be revealed
8441532 openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject
8441533 stating that iupui regret s this situation took place the letter also confirmed that no documents regarding the incident are in sampsons file
8441534 if iupui really thought that sampson had engaged in some racially harassing behavior rather than reading a book there is no reason why they would not have brought it up at the time and no reason why they couldnt say what it is now
8441535 iupuis own letters to sampson made clear that his reading a book about the ku klux klan was the problem and the university claims to have completely exonerated him of all charges if so why are its spokespeople now telling the wall street journal that the problem was really some other mysterious conduct that the university will not reveal to anyone including sampson himself
8441536 a pungent reminder of all thats possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses and in this presidential election year not perhaps only on our campuses
8441537 the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider
8441538 there was undeniably something special something pure and glorious in the clarity of this picture a university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading
8441539 permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time
8441540 this indeed was now the official story as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the universitys media relations representatives
8441541 like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count such were the operations of the universitys guardians of equity and justice
8441542 this case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today the mindset that produces those harassment courts those super heated capacities for perceiving insult is not limited to college campuses its presence is evident in this election campaign which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of barack obama
8441543 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time last week there were some really good players that got hurt around the nfl and you just hope it doesnt happen to you

8441572 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8441573 theres no way a parent today can compare like schools with like schools
8441574 theres nothing available to the national government today that enables us to see across the nation on a comparable system which schools are falling behind and need extra resources
8441575 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality
8441576 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there
8441577 our whole plan is to analyse student population and compare like schools with like schools
8441578 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations
8441579 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8441580 were not only going to take the best practice there were going to take extra resources there
8441581 were pledging a school like that with difficulties would get resources of 500 000 a year extra to make a difference and to bring that school up to standard

8441608 we cant afford to be taken in by the politics of fear
8441609 we are so proud to stand with him as he leads the fight for stronger and tougher foreign policy it is time for barack obama
8441610 he provided the arguments for voting for obama that the delegates can use in coming weeks when voters ask them why they should especially since obama has little foreign policy experience they said the same about me said clinton and look how well i did
8441611 the latest downtempo masterpiece that he has released under the name nightmares on wax

8441613 i trust that you understand your responsibilities regarding the universitys policies on non discrimination and harassment the university now considers this matter closed
8441614 violated his responsibilities as a trustee of dartmouth college which includes acting in the best overall interests of dartmouth and representing dartmouth positively in words and deeds
8441615 he was sitting in khator who was our president renu khator is our president and chancellor he was sitting in her office because weve had weve made so many attempts to meet with her and weve never been able to meet with khator shes always sort of delegated that responsibility to another administrator and weve had so many problems with that thats a whole other topic he was sitting in her office waiting to meet with her cause shes always out of her office always and her assistant told him no shes not in right now and he said okay well ill just wait ill read and somehow they thought that was a threat so they called the university police officers and escorted brendan out and told brendan if he came back he would be he would be handcuffed hed be taken away
8441616 its what we call setting up a table at one of the designated areas on campus and we usually hand out pamphlets or just any sort of information thats good to distribute to people to inform them of our issue we table often but even then its difficult to table because whenever youre standing there at the table and youre just shoving information at people most of the time theyre just theyre on their way to their class and its its not attention grabbing
8441617 even though we have those designated free speech areas we work with our students if they do not want to use one of those areas and we look at where they do want to be able to have expressive activity and then we go through the forum analysis to see how we can help that student get their message across in the forum of their choice
8441618 the real rise of speech codes and free speech zones really came in the late 80s and the early 90s for the most part
8441619 you know in a response to worriers i think that administrators had that protests and unfettered free expression would really cause problems on campus i dont think they really had a good reason to fear that i think they shouldnt have feared that i think they shouldve opened their arms and accepted that and i think that free speech zones were an attempt to make sure that protests didnt take over the whole campus the problem is these free speech zones are so much smaller than the constitution requires at a public university in most cases that what its really done is acted in a way to censor people who want to express themselves in a way that itsnt compatible with that free speech zone some universities have it only during certain hours of the day other ones just a small out of the way part of campus behind a building or there was one university that had it next to a dumpster
8441620 if we dont do a better job of helping students to practice their first amendment freedoms while theyre in school both in high school and in college then i think we face underming the future of freedom of speech in this country and in the first amendment
8441621 so i think that whats at stake here is what kind of society were going to be in the future and people arent born knowing how to be free citizens and how to use their rights responsibly they learn that when theyre in school as part of their education if they learn that at all so if we care about the future of freedom and of free speech then we need to give students meaningful opportunity to excercise their rights while theyre in school
8441622 i think that the university is not just supposed to be a place where youre trained in whatever profession you choose to go into its also a place where youre growing youre growing into an adult and youre learning how to be an adult youre learning who you are in many senses youre growing into a complete person
8441623 i think many americans unfortunately take free speech so for granted that they no longer think too much about it and fail to see when its being eroded
8441624 and as long as its speech that they dont like thats being censored people dont seem to raise their voice or complain so i think were already seeing a kind of i think people are tuning out about this issue and they dont care because they think its speech that is offensive and shouldnt be allowed in the first place what they forget is when their speech when they want to express their views and its censored then they have already given to the government the power or to school officials the power to censor what they believe
8441625 on many fronts we feel like were not being supported
8441626 i mean there are those that have supported us and i think i think because we do feel like were being criticized so much those who do support us it means so much we really appreciate them and theyre really what keeps us going and we also know that weve really studied these issues were not just following something blindly we really feel we know whats going on out there and it disturbs us so that too knowing that were doing the right thing that really keeps us going but we do feel like were being criticized on many fronts and just like you said when we when we read comments online from the houston chronicle or the daily cougar which is our university of houston newspaper we have so many criticizing comments we really do but i think we have to write that off as people that are not educated on the issue
8441627 the text of the constitution doesnt say very much about that whats really important is the various supreme court decisions having to do with free speech there are some legitimate restrictions one of them is insitement which means to actually advocating imminent lawless action against somebody or something so its not as much as just making somebody angry as actually encouraging them to do something illegal thats one example of speech that can be prohibited theres forms of commercial speech that can be prohibited you know theres the old chestnut about shouting fire in a crowded theatre which has to do with whether or not your speech is really a form of disruptive behavior so there are exceptions but lets not forget the vast majority of speech that you and i engage in everyday is well protected by the first amendment
8441628 the land of the free has become the land of the easily offended
8441629 and i think that we forget if theres not a first amendment right not to be offended that freedom of speech includes the right to say things that may make other people uncomfortable but thats what weve got to learn as citizens in one country with many different views many different religions respective weve got to learn how to debate one another counter one another with civility and respect and yet with openess and freedom

8441646 left with no assurance that temple will not reimplement its pre january 15 sexual harassment policy absent an injunction after this litigation is complete
8441647 expressive visual or physical conduct of a sexual or gender motivated nature
8441648 unreasonably interfering with an individuals work educational performance or status
8441649 under the language of temples policy a student who sets out to interfere with another students work educational performance or status would be subject to sanctions regardless of whether these motives and actions had their intended effect
8441650 t he policy punishes not only speech that actually causes disruption but also speech that merely intends to do so by its terms it covers speech which has the purpose or effect of interfering with educational performance or creating a hostile environment this ignores a previous decisions requirement that a school must reasonably believe that speech will cause actual material disruption before prohibiting it
8441651 t he policys use of hostile offensive and gender motivated is on its face sufficiently broad and subjective that they could conceivably be applied to cover any speech of a gender motivated nature the content of which offends someone
8441652 absent any requirement akin to a showing of severity or pervasiveness that is a requirement that the conduct objectively and subjectively creates a hostile environment or substantially interferes with an individuals work the policy provides no shelter for core protected speech
8441653 a student would look at this policy and say whoa i cant say anything that has the purpose or effect of creating an offensive environment and that is really dangerous and can inhibit an academic discussion
8441654 it allows the university to look at the students intent and not just the result
8441655 suing universities for speech codes becomes a lot easier because you dont need to have a victimized litigant
8441656 that reality creates for universities an impetus to change their policies before someone tries to sue them
8441657 there is no proof that this plaintiff was in any way put at risk or threatened or even reasonably felt threatened by the existence of the policy
8441658 standard prerequisite in first amendment litigation including those cases that have invalidated genuinely coercive speech codes
8441659 im baffled that the court made no reference either to what consequences he might have faced or to any attempt to demonstrate that this particular plaintiff had said or was likely to say things that might bring the sexual harassment policy down on his head
8441660 prevent public institutions from adopting and articulating standards and expectations of civility and collegiality if they contain any language that a court might construe to be restrictive with respect to expression
8441661 tired of your planet flights leaving daily at spore com
8441662 i came here and said we need to fix this i dont know why they didnt change it before i got here
8441663 the policy is so vague and so broad that it cannot be enforced across the board so it will necessarily be enforced arbitrarily
8441664 violence threat of violence or disregard of potential harm to others or against oneself or actions which endanger any member or guest of the university community including physical verbal or sexual assault and relationship domestic violence
8441665 you write a policy 10 years ago and it makes sense at the time but over time things change court cases occur that challenge similar policies at other schools causing you to look at your policies and you revise them as needed
8441666 i think its annoying when people alternate between capital and lowercase letters in their e mails is that annoying enough
8441667 i think its annoying when i get a bunch of e mails from campus groups that dont interest me could they be punished for that
8441668 thats a problematic word annoying is too vague i think
8441669 annoying somebody is not very nice but its not something to punish somebody for
8441670 thats a good example of what should happen its clear concise and more detailed and it still protects students
8441671 offensive or demeaning language or treatment of an individual where such language is based typically on prejudicial treatment
8441672 were very conscious of what students rights are and what they can do
8441673 human behavior is vague its not an absolute thing we try to find the common ground and determine how to best apply it in an educational environment

8441695 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8441696 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek

8441698 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8441699 it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman

8441708 a c mara e o senado juntos ajudariam a definir posicionamentos partid rios
8441709 a comiss o mista seria boa para discutir o assunto e ajudar a proposta a avan ar mas n o teria poder regimental para deliberar sobre ela
8441710 n s n o podemos desconsiderar o ac mulo de debates que o congresso j tem sobre esses temas

8441712 na ltima vez que isso foi debatido o executivo ficou margem da discuss o achando que era uma quest o s do legislativo dada a import ncia do tema viemos demonstrar que o executivo quer ser parceiro da id ia ajudando o congresso
8441713 o governo s pensa nisso prop e uma reforma enorme mas no fundo o que quer fragilizar os partidos e permitir a infidelidade partid ria

8441716 its about developing the skills and developing the intellect and it teaches you how to be competitive

8441773 as equipes de pol tica internacional de clinton e bush agiram com base em duas premissas falsas
8441774 uma que a r ssia naturalmente agressiva e que o fim da guerra fria n o poderia mudar isso ent o tivemos que expandir nossa alian a militar at suas bordas apesar do besteirol ortodoxo sobre usar a otan para promover a democracia a cren a da eterna agressividade da r ssia a nica base na qual a expans o da otan fez algum sentido especialmente quando voc considera que foi dito aos russos que eles n o podiam entrar a outra premissa que a r ssia sempre seria fraca demais para p r em perigo qualquer novo membro da otan ent o nunca ter amos que comprometer tropas para defend los isso n o custaria nada para n s eles estavam enganados em ambos os casos
8441775 foi idiota e possivelmente criminoso mas ao contr rio de putin ele tem comandado o pa s em uma dire o claramente democr tica tem contido a corrup o e esteve frente de um crescimento econ mico r pido que n o depende como a r ssia dos altos pre os do petr leo e do g s

8441779 quando vi a terra de cima pela primeira vez era linda impressionante estava em paz mas o que realmente mudou minha forma de pensar foi ver o horizonte porque fez com que me desse conta de que nosso planeta muito mais fr gil do que eu achava portanto me tornei mais ecologista desde ent o

8441783 it is the first fossil of a pregnant turtle found in the world and its only the second fossil of an animal found in the world thats pregnant
8441784 its a very primitive turtle and its basically an ancestor of modern turtles so we can look at characteristics of the eggs and nests and we can learn about the evolution of these traits in turtles today
8441785 the turtle was prepared at the royal tyrrell museum so basically the fossil was removed from the rock so that probably took about a year
8441786 last year we finally finished the preparation of the turtle nest so i wanted to publish them together in a single paper so thats why its out now
8441787 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8441788 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8441789 the odds of actually of finding an animal that died and was fossilized at the time it was basically laying its eggs is basically one in a million so when you find something like that you know youve found something that is unique
8441790 absolutely thats why we keep going back every summer in the hope that you actually find something new that was not known before
8441791 the loss of del martin is a great loss for me personally and for our entire community
8441792 del was an extraordinary woman her grace courage and commitment were a source of strength to all who knew her
8441793 the marriage marked an historic milestone on our countrys road to true freedom and equality del laid the groundwork for all those who want a life of dignity and we are forever in her debt
8441794 new classics of the fantastic will be an essential science fiction library
8441795 baracks candidacy would not have been conceivable 50 years ago
8441796 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a trans racial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8441797 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8441798 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8441799 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8441800 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8441801 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8441802 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8441803 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did
8441804 to do what only great orators can do offer a compelling vision of the future thats what great oratory is its not just putting words together its putting the right words to match the historical moment
8441805 es sind begriffe des verstandes der wahrnehmung f r welche zeit keine solch restriktive
8441806 um l der da oposi o mencionou que talvez haja muitos poderes relativos ao fundo uma abertura para fazer aplica es diversas ent o n s concordamos que poderemos delimitar mais por exemplo ele n o poder ser usado para adquirir uma empresa no exterior ou financiar diretamente uma empresa

8441808 o ministro da fazenda passa a ser usando uma analogia com as empresas o dono da totalidade das a es ele controla a assembl ia geral e o presidente do conselho e o deus da aplica o do fundo
8441809 portanto n o h como o congresso aprovar uma coisa t o vaga o que se deve buscar primeiro uma forma de administra o transparente e segura para os recursos do pa s n o serem desperdi ados
8441810 com o pr sal evidentemente o aporte tende a ser muito maior algo estrat gico para o pa s e portanto quest es de governan a de gest o de aplica o de recursos podem ser detalhes na forma mas em termos de conte do s o muito relevantes

8441815 the current president has called the relationship with china a strategic partnership
8441816 i believe our relationship needs to be redefined as one as competitor
8441817 the defense department with feith cambone wolfowitz and rumsfeld was dispatching a person to taiwan every week essentially to tell the taiwanese that the alliance was back on
8441818 essentially to tell chen shui bian whose entire power in taiwan rested on the independence movement that independence was a good thing
8441819 china will have a greater sense of responsibility for the institutions mission
8441820 it doesnt reflect a change of heart so much as an admission of failure
8441821 if you dont know what you are doing you will die
8441822 there are a gazillion great ideas out there but it comes down to who you can get to buy into your product
8441823 this is business and you have to consider to whom youre pitching your idea which audience they attract and who you can get attached to your project to make it more viable
8441824 we also made a decision to select a team that had a presence in los angeles and new york because those cities are essential in the industry and having representation there makes a big difference
8441825 the first thing networks and studios consider is how a project will fit into their network film or theater
8441826 because the buyer needs to satisfy his or her client such as advertisers and make money
8441827 that way you dont have to worry if you were paid appropriately
8441828 we spend a lot of money on legal and accounting because the right team makes sure that we are on budget and represented properly
8441829 so its still our show and we are compensated every time it airs
8441830 our legal team holds us to the fire on it as much as you do not want to feel compromised in a deal you should consider your opponents perspective
8441831 walk away when youre forced to compromise your moral perspective and if you know in your heart that you will not be able to perform at your absolute best with the given terms

8441857 it looks like wikileaks is still looking for the optimal method to distribute its materials
8441858 i think it will automatically rule out publications like the new york times and others that might devote significant attention to an in depth look at such internal e mails but would not pay for them
8441859 whether u s media outlets are cheap or have ethics i dont know
8441860 the degree to which news organizations refuse to pay for the news is proportional to the degree to which they are able to bilk the public with unworthy alternatives
8441861 indeed for anyone who has been in the news business for a while knows manufacture of news is so arbitrary the result must be described primarily as mere entertainment
8441862 good for them we live in a capitalist country everything has a dollar value even ethical behavior so get over it lets see what is going on behind the scenes with hugo and the gang

8441893 today american influence abroad wanes our advice is not sought our warnings are not heeded our standing in the world is at an all time low for seven long years america has paid a dear price for the national security mistakes of president bush and john mccain
8441894 we entered into an unnecessary war and remain bogged down in iraq as afghanistan backslides and the architects of sept 11 remain free on bush and mccains watch we have witnessed the growing influence of a belligerent iran that has destabilized the middle east and threatens our ally israel
8441895 barack obama knows that no child left behind has left millions behind he will reform it and focus on early childhood education to get our kids on the right track from the start he joined all democrats in congress to pass the largest investment in college aid in 64 years john mccain opposed that plan and barack obama championed the largest increase in education benefits for our troops since the gi bill john mccain said it was too generous women struggling to provide their children with a good education know that we cant afford more of the same

8441898 she should have kept her mouth shut or she should step down
8441899 it seemed she was being pushed out of the race
8441900 and when they pushed her they were pushing us because we worked for her
8441901 vote for whoever you want to vote for but remember this never took place because if they hear that were divisive you do nothing but demean the democratic party and put mccain in office

8441903 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running

8441919 i think the conservatives are facing enough risks in this campaign because basically harpers putting his government on the line with no guarantee of success
8441920 a wild card thats not likely to play in his favour
8441921 there is no valid argument that theres been any cuts whatsoever to the canadian food inspection agency
8441922 whats occurred could lead to a broader discussion on governments role in these kind of things and its pretty clear that the harper government has more of a laissez faire self regulatory view on a lot of these issues
8441923 so it could leave the conservatives vulnerable if a narrative emerges that this is an example of what happens when you dont have actual government inspectors and you cant rely on an industry to police itself
8441924 this issue goes to the heart of what stephen harper is all about
8441925 hes a prime minister in charge of governing who doesnt believe in government
8441926 theyve moved to a paper system whereby industry basically regulates itself so the big loss in terms of front line inspection happened long before the conservatives came on board the conservatives are simply doing another round in the same direction
8441927 these comparisons are totally unacceptable and take credibility away from the very real objections made about these cuts
8441928 civilized political discourse as canadians gear up for what is expected to be a fall election
8441929 the comparison of canadas prime minister to nazi leader adolf hitler is obscene and offensive
8441930 such statements trivialize the holocaust and inject ugly rhetoric in what ought to be reasoned debate on real and pressing political issues
8441931 we must wonder about the sincerity of a government that recognizes the people of quebec as a nation when it does not hesitate to cut into the very heart of its existence culture
8441932 in addition to ensuring the financial stability of dozens of organizations across canada the financial support of government facilitates the collection of private donations which in turn can promote production here and abroad

8441939 there was information gathered through either staff or inmates that there was an escape plan
8441940 but they couldnt determine what unit was involved which inmates whether it was from inside the unit or outside the prison on maybe an escort or something so they were just trying to glean some of that information
8441941 they said that there was no specific intelligence to this breakout happening on that unit with those inmates
8441942 if the intelligence was specific then we should have been locking down the prison in this case with no specifics they didnt feel it necessary to lock down the whole prison
8441943 inside the unit preliminary investigation has determined that some of the bricks were in fact removed
8441944 the hole was big enough for a person to fit through thats pretty obvious
8441945 the ministry officials have told me they cant determine if they climbed over the fence or how they got out of the yard
8441946 the section that was breached was built in 1960s im looking at the investigation team telling me if we have longstanding structural problems
8441947 to breach a wall inside the unit in what is a very secure unit causes me grave concern
8441948 our members have been working with management to improve the current system which is not working but to date many issues remain unresolved
8441949 we believe there are systemic problems that need to be addressed
8441950 we dont have confirmation that theyre gang members we dont know if this had a role to play
8441951 as much as a week ago we were concerned about there not being that many people downtown and it looking like a ghost town downtown has never looked more crowded

8441953 he is battle proven but not limited to being a battle rapper his approach to hip hop is refreshing and challenging and its no holds barred 07 is gonna be serious for hip hop pun intended
8441954 overcoming obstacles and winning regardless of the greatest challenges life throws at you is what makes a real champion
8441955 the government must be held responsible for any act of this gang

8441958 he has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths he has one genital organ and a full set of limbs said dr bari
8441959 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly

8441963 computer or digital forensic services or in the acquisition review or analysis of digital or computer based information whether for purposes of obtaining or furnishing information for evidentiary or other purposes or for providing expert testimony before a court
8441964 investigation and expert testimony in computer forensics and network testing should be based upon the current state of science and technology best practices in the industry and knowledge skills and education of the expert
8441965 the public and courts will be negatively impacted if e discovery forensic investigations network testing and other computer services can be performed only by licensed private investigators because not all licensed private investigators are qualified to perform computer forensic services and many qualified computer forensic professionals would be excluded because they are not licensed
8441966 computer forensic assignments often require handling data in multiple jurisdictions for example data may need to be imaged from hard drives in new york texas and michigan

8441968 does the person performing that work need to have licenses in all three states
8441969 this represents a parallel approach for how to make cells in regenerative medicine
8441970 and now that its shown that you can turn one of your cells into another it makes you think of what other cells youd like to convert
8441971 its a system thats easier to manipulate than getting a new stem cell to turn into something you want
8441972 the kind of work done here has the promise to go into clinical practice in a relatively short time
8441973 weve made a cell type but we havent yet made a whole tissue
8441974 if youve got extra cells of one type and need another why go all the way back to a stem cell
8441975 in the new innovation model research needs to keep addressing the need of the mother company
8441976 say in the case of integrated circuits there were many many small steps that occurred along the way resulting from decades worth of work in matters of physics
8441977 so the measure of time and the frequency standards that are used to do it date back to research in optical pumping which led to the development of hydrogen maser
8441978 bell labs could do the kind of fundamental research it did in the past because it was functioning as part of a monopoly

8441985 pretty soon well be payin for stuff with a chip in our hands
8441986 this is a pretty disturbingly high percentage it doesnt speak to anything adverse on the customers part though but more the high level of social engineering on the part of the attackers

8441989 we had a feeling that we were going to win it unfortunately it took 13 innings for us to do it
8441990 it was definitely exciting it probably felt like the little league world series players you forget that you get paid to play the game its almost like we felt like little kids with the excitement in kind of playoff type atmosphere which is pretty normal when we play the mets
8441991 five reasons why its in the interest of northern consumers to support the cause and struggle of small farmers in the south

8442001 in all of the letters he expressed regret for the situation
8442002 he said he believed the situation should and could have been handled differently
8442003 they would pursue the matter investigate and interview all parties involved
8442004 who would want to hire someone who had this controversy
8442005 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football

8442010 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field

8442019 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8442020 after the new release of the iphone 2 1 software which supports flash and flash video playback an increasing number of masturbation in public spaces such as libraries and subways have been reported
8442021 most serious developers make iphone friendly versions of their sites anyway
8442022 when contacted by the asa apple said it built the safari web browser on the iphone using open standards and that it could not reasonably assure compatibility with every third party plug in or technology on the market
8442023 oh thats a load of apple can do no wrong and the iphone is the best piece of technology ever created wahhh
8442024 did i actually talk about this with someone where did i get this idea from
8442025 something about language acquisition differences in children and adults related to the idea of tuning out repeated or familiar stimulation
8442026 here was a dream about discovering something important about language learning discovered in some way as well as the real nature behind why language acquisition becomes harder as puberty recedes and the exact nature of the module that goes missing
8442027 yeah i cant play any more guitar hero i have to go back and sleep

8442035 clintons motion to nominate obama by acclamation appears to have been a terrific tactic to bring about unity
8442036 more and more people are realising that green taxes have nothing to do with being green theyre just an excuse to tax us more
8442037 theyve got more to do with a greedy government that is trying to fill a black hole in its finances
8442038 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed families and businesses
8442039 with the credit crunch squeezing budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust
8442040 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8442041 people pay for electricity motor fuel and other goods subject to green taxes with income that has already been taxed companies that pay green taxes also pay corporation tax and most green taxes are accompanied by vat
8442042 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8442043 for example while fuel duty recognises the environmental costs of driving it also pays for important public services including new roads and public transport and efforts to tackle child poverty
8442044 i think the answer to the problems of pollution would be to bring in a green tax

8442046 se trata de un convenio que abre las puertas a la federaci n y la hermandad con uno de los teatros m s venerados a nivel internacional como es el teatro col n
8442047 es una de las cosas que m s nos preocupan es decir tener un plantel t cnico que nos pueda servir a los que nos manejamos en el mbito teatral
8442048 se apunta a la formaci n en los oficios teatrales que en algunos casos se han perdido
8442049 fundamentalmente porque son oficios que faltan los que hacemos teatro sabemos lo necesario que son y lo importante que es la formaci n
8442050 la intenci n es abaratar costos por ejemplo si nos interesa traer una obra o un espect culo que se pone en buenos aires coordinamos con rosario y santa fe para economizar recursos en lo que respecta a traslados y gastos de producci n
8442051 lo interesante de las coproducciones art sticas es que aportan elementos art sticos y de formaci n que despu s quedar n en la ciudad no s lo van a venir espect culos del teatro col n sino que como habr participaci n de artistas locales contribuir a fomentar su formaci n y experiencia
8442052 hay una decisi n de que el teatro col n no quede s lo en buenos aires sino que vaya al interior del pa s creo que es una muy buena oportunidad para nosotros
8442053 failing to meet basic rights is not acceptable no one should have to go without help with eating and drinking or using the toilet yet this is still happening every day in hospitals and care homes
8442054 its horrendous that people are still being mistreated and abused human rights are not visible enough in government policy and are even more difficult to see in practice
8442055 without a commitment from policy makers and staff to uphold peoples human rights we cannot be confident our loved ones will be treated with dignity or respect
8442056 we were told he needed extra fluids for his kidneys but he wasnt given any help to drink water or pass fluids
8442057 he couldnt use the water jug left by his bed as he couldnt sit up after six days i spoke to a doctor when a drip and a catheter were fitted two litres of urine were drained off he died of renal failure
8442058 my father should not have been treated this way it took months to get my complaint heard and i have been battling for many more months to get the hospital to implement the action plan no one checks change has happened its all taken on trust
8442059 we are doing everything in our power to protect vulnerable older people and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect in all care settings no one especially not elderly people should have to put up with abuse or ill treatment
8442060 most immigration is from non eu countries these are countries from which immigration could be restricted if it were government policy to do so
8442061 the impression is being carefully fostered that since numbers from eastern europe are now declining the public need no longer have concerns about uk immigration levels
8442062 nothing could be further from the truth in fact east europeans have never accounted for more than a third of the total
8442063 this is more evidence why the government should answer our calls to have an annual limit on non eu immigration it also undermines government rhetoric that immigration cannot be controlled because it is mainly from the eu
8442064 covers close to six in 10 of all migrants more than a cap

8442071 yes it sounds ridiculous that the police chief could even come up with this idea it does indeed bear watching but for more reasons than you know http tinyurl com 5uw2qf is to a july 1 article in the culpeper star exponent about the proposed consolidation of the town of culpeper and culpeper county that would extend the town borders all the way to the county lines not only are they trying to move me into the town against my wishes theyre doing it in closed meetings of the governing bodies what effect would the chiefs plan have on us living in the county who are now able to shoot in our back yards would the police department even exist any longer what town ordinances would carry over and what would be eliminated i was against the consolidation plan at the first announcement now ive gotta get militant
8442072 yes renewing 180 90 days ahead of expiry is the law
8442073 title should read 7 yes renewing 180 90 days ahead of expiry is the law to receive the full 5 year term from your previous chp expiration date because you may still renew between 89 days to 1 day ahead but youll receive a new permit with the expiration date 5 years from the date of issue
8442074 i think that people who want to take this within 24 hours of the event and make it their political hobby horse to ride ive got nothing but loathing for them
8442075 just a short note to share a rewarding experience with henrico county while renewing my chp i realized i had made a terrific blunder while reading my renewal date i had misread it as expiring on 9 26 08 when in reality it expired on 7 26 08 while filling out the paperwork on 8 01 08 to renew i discovered my blunder i felt i was too far into the process to quit so i completed the form and explained my mistake to the clerk she took my paperwork and stated someone would call me within 30 days to my amazement i received a letter from the clerk dated 8 19 08 that my permit was ready with pick up instructions i was not hassled in any way for any reason during this process henrico county showed their true professionalism in this transaction
8442076 on aug 5 i submitted my legal bare bones chp renewal to fairfax county just the vsp form a front and back copy of my current permit and the money order for 50
8442077 i just wanted to get the word out that the rivanna rifle amp pistol club rrpc in charlottesville va will be offering two open to the public sight in weekends to help hunters get ready for hunting season the weekends are oct 25th amp 26th and nov 8th amp 9th sat hours will be 10 00am until dusk sun hours will be from 1 30pm until dusk we will be using the 100 yard rifle range that has targets set at 25 50 and 100 yards the club will provide targets sandbags and shooting benches we will also have spotting scopes and basic tools to adjust sights amp scopes this is open to all hunting firearms muzzle loaders rifles and hunting pistols there are three shooting benches available and it will be a first come first to shoot affair
8442078 i am criminal defense lawyer and a vcdl member i take a fair amount of court appointed cases
8442079 they say it should be only a few weeks now then ill get my license from the district police and ill be back in business
8442080 this is part of a broad campaign by the nra to get guns into all our public places
8442081 it is hard to view this proposed change as anything more than an election year gimmick directed at the nra and the sportsmens community
8442082 weve got bigger issues facing our parks than accommodating a relative handful of people who want to carry a concealed firearm
8442083 we dont think people should forfeit that right when they go for a hike in the woods
8442084 if we are talking handguns youd need a pretty good sized piece to stop a bear
8442085 i dont picture a hiker packing a 44 magnum these are people who drill holes in their toothbrushes to save weight
8442086 our organization is not opposed to gun ownership and people carrying weapons
8442087 but we just dont feel they are necessary in national parks
8442088 i am a retired police officer retired navy masterchief and a grandfather
8442089 i am too old to run and too big to hide i have a concealed carry permit in my state therefore i keep a gun nearby to protect myself and family
8442090 as a woman who often hikes alone in the national parks i have rarely feared for my personal safety
8442091 however if this rule change is implemented i will be faced with the possibility that the next person i meet on the trail may carry a loaded gun this does nothing to make me feel safer
8442092 im pretty much a fan that if youve been trained if you are registered then you ought to be able to carry a weapon
8442093 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
8442094 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
8442095 he saved his girlfriends life and possibly others who would have been here
8442096 this is a really sad story my heart goes out to the families involved
8442097 for some reason though it bothers me that 60 gun owners were asked to voluntarily relinquish their legally owned firearms
8442098 since when does oklahoma have handgun registration i seriously hope they catch the vermin responsible for this but im disturbed by the implication that oklahoma one of the most free states in the usa has handgun registration
8442099 i would never voluntarily submit their weapons for testing get a warrant
8442100 i wouldn t voluntarily submit my firearms to law enforcement without a warrant either this is really starting to bother me why ask 60 citizens to do this or maybe theyre waiting for somebody to refuse to submit voluntarily whereupon they do get a warrant
8442101 why dont they just test fire all the 40 cal handguns in oklahoma yeah thats the ticket
8442102 i hate to perhaps sound callous about the tragedy thats not my intent at all but this is some of the goofiest stuff ive ever heard of
8442103 what the osbi stupidly did was ensure that if the real murderer still has the murder weapon and got one of these letters he will now without doubt destroy it post haste
8442104 human beings can only interact with one another through two methods reason or force if at any point either party chooses force the other must either submit or respond with force
8442105 i prefer reason but i am ready to respond with force submission is not an option
8442106 the issue of private control of firearms in the united states has been a hot topic this year in light of the washington d
8442107 its no wonder that the district is awash with lawlessness the contempt for the law starts in the city council chambers
8442108 the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home
8442109 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
8442110 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
8442111 our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
8442112 the book most feared by gun grabbers in government and media why because when you and other thinking americans read it they can kiss their gun ban plans goodbye
8442113 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
8442114 extremist elitist gun control people to help stop the killing of such people as bill gwatney not laws that will enable more people to own guns and then kill people with them
8442115 my heritage and my rights as a southerner and an american is a bunch of bull somebody please tell the youngster that he can wear whatever he wants at home but not to bring such clothing to school because it will only continue to divide people that is something we dont need in america today

8442124 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8442125 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8442126 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8442127 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8442128 i cant speak for shasta i cant get inside her head
8442129 possibly now well have to be dragged through a court proceeding in california if they go ahead with the prosecution it would be such as waste of taxpayer money because hell never spend a day in a california prison
8442130 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8442131 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again
8442132 we wanted to give the mustang pony a more realistic feel

8442160 the long term defense implications of finding ways to turn thoughts into acts if it can be developed are enormous imagine u s warfighters that only need use the power of their thoughts to do things at great distances
8442161 inspiration from nature will allow more life like qualities in the system
8442162 were interested in investigating biological organisms because they have evolved over many many years to be particularly good at surviving in the environment and we hope to learn from some of those strategies that mother nature has developed
8442163 i can see why so many third base coaches send runners
8442164 the chances of a perfect throw are very slim it was one of those times it hit catcher mike redmond right in the chest
8442165 i dont like this place i dont know what it is about this place but they play us tough
8442166 in my mind he was going to have to come over me to score that run
8442167 that was obviously a big play just to hold them off
8442168 that was huge im sure he feels wonderful i feel good for him
8442169 usually i pride myself that if we score some runs i dont give up the lead that wasnt the case today
8442170 im thankful the guys picked me up and picked the team up
8442171 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8442172 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8442173 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8442174 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8442175 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back

8442177 baracks candidacy would not have been conceivable 50 years ago
8442178 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a trans racial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8442179 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8442180 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8442181 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8442182 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8442183 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8442184 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8442185 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did
8442186 to do what only great orators can do offer a compelling vision of the future thats what great oratory is its not just putting words together its putting the right words to match the historical moment
8442187 to get away from where we are to where we are no better off

8442202 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is its awful hard with only a little bit of experience to have a clear sense of what you would do on the most critical issues facing us today

8442364 its a script that my company red hour got that was written as a live action movie but we thought it would work as an animated movie so we brought it to robert downey jr plays an evil superhero villain basically its about a bad guy who loses to the good guy that hes fighting all the time so he has to create another good guy for him to fight
8442365 why not change this one element that weve been doing and do it different or just drop it or replace it with something else
8442366 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek

8442368 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8442369 it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman

8442374 they pride themselves on being a new breed of news delivery
8442375 media organizations pay hundreds of thousands to millions for photos and video footage
8442376 people magazine notoriously paid over 10 million for brad pitt and angelina jolies baby photos
8442377 it looks like wikileaks is still looking for the optimal method to distribute its materials
8442378 i think it will automatically rule out publications like the new york times and others that might devote significant attention to an in depth look at such internal e mails but would not pay for them
8442379 whether u s media outlets are cheap or have ethics i dont know
8442380 the degree to which news organizations refuse to pay for the news is proportional to the degree to which they are able to bilk the public with unworthy alternatives
8442381 indeed for anyone who has been in the news business for a while knows manufacture of news is so arbitrary the result must be described primarily as mere entertainment
8442382 good for them we live in a capitalist country everything has a dollar value even ethical behavior so get over it lets see what is going on behind the scenes with hugo and the gang

8442387 were being forced by the government to work for them and if we dont work for them theyre going to send us to jail back to prison
8442388 id like to see that and at some point him get involved romantically even though he is involved romantically it would just be nice to see more of lincolns sensitive kind of side right now hes pretty much a bull at the gate
8442389 even with sofia at his side dominic says that he gets very little opportunity to explore that plot line
8442390 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8442391 sometimes it was kind of questionable what play i was really running
8442392 i know i was all smiles out there and it really looked like i knew what i was doing but im not going to lie there were some moments where i really didnt know the play or i was a little late with my reads
8442393 i get that defensive end mentality i mean its fun hanging out with those big guys when were doing sprints ill run around the goalposts twice to let them catch up or ill act like im tired when im not really tired just to make them feel better
8442394 its just that hes light years ahead of where he was last year in terms of comfort and command of the huddle and command of what were doing hes undefeated and the players totally believe in him that is a huge thing
8442395 you know what he does he makes up for it lack of a big arm by being able to anticipate
8442396 he has a good arm and when he plays at the speed hes playing at right now he has the ability to get the ball out of his hands quickly hes playing fast hes making good reads and its not an issue because hes getting rid of the ball quicker
8442397 as long as youre able to get the ball up early enough for the receiver to run under it thats all that matters it doesnt really depend on your arm strength its more your decision making
8442398 he throws a great ball hes been throwing great balls all camp
8442399 he doesnt want to let anybody on the team down he cares about making the team better not making himself look good
8442400 if you win youll get praised if you lose you got to be ready to take the hit
8442401 this offer is a compelling transaction for quiksilver said robert mcknight chairman and chief executive
8442402 the current operating environment in the uk housing market remains very challenging and we do not anticipate any recovery in the short term
8442403 the process is going fine and we would hope to complete in the next few weeks it is a detailed process but there are no roadblocks
8442404 in our view the key thing is that no conclusions have been reached yet we believe that there are too many negatives surrounding the taylor wimpey statement at the current time

8442431 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8442432 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he said
8442433 we expect margins to contract by 2 to 3 per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said

8442462 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8442463 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8442464 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8442466 i am concerned because even if we have our pickups like normal many places are overrun with garbage and it could be a problem in the best of circumstances but with this going on it could be a nightmare
8442467 we usually pull about 200 more tons of garbage over the course of the four or five day event than we normally do
8442468 but were also insuring harley davidson event sites as well those include veterans park the summerfest grounds and also the harley davidson museum so weve got a special plan in place for those sites
8442469 hes young 24 and he comes from madrid so he understands what big club football is all about said kenyon
8442470 when we sat down scolari said youve got such a great squad that you need something special to improve it he came up with two names deco and robinho robinho wants to be recognised as one of the worlds best players i know everyone does but robinho is different to what we have had
8442471 hes a very good player because of his unpredictable style said the former brazil coach
8442472 if you expect something he can change in a second
8442473 the young boys and girls have a dream to know john terry joe cole kalou and they are here scolari said
8442474 easy to meet and to talk to its fantastic that we encourage good relations sometimes the press say the players dont like this sort of thing but they do after theyve been here the players feel touched by it in their hearts
8442475 i get fed up because its not right said kenyon
8442476 you write money off over the term of a contract before offloading shevchenko to san siro the striker was valued at 15 million on chelseas books
8442477 value for money from a former european footballer of the year who surprisingly lacked toughness and also did not suit jose mourinhos tactics
8442478 remember we got deco for 8 million and that looks to be the buy of the season
8442479 we are gaining respect every year and the rest of europe see us as a real club he said
8442480 a lot of that has been behind the scenes work were very influential in european football if you look at where we were five years ago to where we are now it has been a meteoric rise it is about growing up and ultimately you win the champions league and that cements your position
8442481 i have a dream same as the young boys and girls here to win all the competitions said scolari
8442482 hes engaging you look at him with the children today and hes easy everyone can relate to him that happened with the players from day one hes been a big character in the game for a long time but hes got a real human side to him
8442483 we brought him in because he was the best person for the job and would definitely move us on from where we were under avram grant and where we had been under jose
8442484 mammaaaa ti vuoi stare zitta andiamocene a casa guarda io non vi sopporto pi maledetta a me quando ho deciso di uscire con voi

8442486 we can be slow as well to give greatness its due a mistake i made myself long ago when i voted against a federal holiday in memory of dr king i was wrong and eventually realized that in time to give full support for a state holiday in arizona
8442487 after he got home my dad met and married my mom cindy
8442488 ive kind of been texting him back and forth and hes doing great and wife lucy is doing great
8442489 kami telah percaya kepada rasul dan membenarkan kami pun telah menyaksikan bahwa apa yang kau bawa itu adalah benar kami telah memberikan janji kami dan jaminan kami bahwa kami akan tetap setia laksanakanlah kehendakmu kami disampingmu demi yang telah mengutus kamu sekirannya kau bentangkan lautan di hadapan kami lalu kau terjun menyeberanginya kami pun akan terjun bersamamu dan tak seorang pun dari kami akan tinggal di belakang

8442491 there is a strong probability that it will be a category 3 storm by the time it enters the gulf and it has the potential to strengthen into a category 4 or 5 storm over the gulf
8442492 fortunately we have a revolution its guaranteed that nobody will be forgotten
8442493 if lives are lost it wont be hundreds or thousands
8442494 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part

8442497 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8442498 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8442499 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8442500 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8442501 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8442502 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8442503 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8442504 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8442505 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8442506 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8442507 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8442508 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8442509 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8442510 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8442511 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8442512 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8442513 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8442514 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8442515 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8442516 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8442517 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8442518 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8442519 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8442520 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8442521 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8442522 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8442523 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8442524 no one works for someone we all just work together
8442525 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too

8442532 i dont believe i have the correct understanding of gods word i have the bible the bible is the living perfect word of god
8442533 pride is only bad when its hubris that is the belief that you are self made and therefore not subject to god
8442534 fine but is there any way to talk about god and not be proud i mean were just trying to spread the good news here
8442535 the belief that you have an absolute incontrovertible understanding of gods word is a proud belief
8442536 paired with evangelism is the desire to have certain tenets of faith enacted as laws laws which not only affect evangelists but also other citizens of a country that dont necessarily agree with the evangelists beliefs
8442537 paired with evangelism is the desire to have certain tenets of faith enacted as laws
8442538 faith is taking the first step even when you dont see the whole staircase

8442541 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

8442543 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
8442544 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8442545 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8442546 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8442547 barack obama is ready to honour the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8442548 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8442549 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8442550 this has been a joy we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8442551 q1 was great start to the fiscal year highlighted by exceptional global growth and continued diversification of our customer base
8442552 the companys first quarter results are an early indication that the company is on track to achieving its revenue and operating cost structure objectives for fiscal 2009
8442553 the company is addressing a lower than expected q1 gross margin level with product cost reduction initiatives and has recently completed a staff reduction to keep the company in line with its operating earnings expectations
8442554 welcome to the jungle we got fun ngames we got everthing you want honey we know the names
8442555 take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
8442556 your daddy work in porno now that mommys not around she used to love her heroin but now shes underground
8442557 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8442558 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8442559 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8442560 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8442561 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8442562 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8442563 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8442564 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8442565 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8442566 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8442567 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8442568 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8442569 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8442570 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8442571 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8442572 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8442573 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8442574 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8442575 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8442576 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8442577 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8442578 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8442579 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8442580 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8442581 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8442582 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8442583 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8442584 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8442585 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8442586 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8442587 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8442588 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8442589 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8442590 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8442591 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8442592 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8442593 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8442594 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8442595 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8442596 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8442597 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8442598 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8442599 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8442600 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8442601 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8442602 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8442603 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8442604 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8442605 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds

8442609 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8442610 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8442611 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8442612 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8442613 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8442614 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8442615 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8442616 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8442617 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8442618 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8442619 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8442620 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8442621 we would meet every saturday and there was an amazing collection of guys with dogs
8442622 is helping me build a community of dog owners here it makes us a very visible example of responsible dog ownership
8442623 we had 80 dogs on the steam train three cars packed full then we had a bbq with live music
8442624 we have ceos of silicon valley based companies and people at much lower pay grades we all share the love of dogs ive been shocked to find out who some of these people are
8442625 you go to a dog park and people are standing around while the dogs get the exercise
8442626 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8442627 after the new release of the iphone 2 1 software which supports flash and flash video playback an increasing number of masturbation in public spaces such as libraries and subways have been reported
8442628 most serious developers make iphone friendly versions of their sites anyway
8442629 when contacted by the asa apple said it built the safari web browser on the iphone using open standards and that it could not reasonably assure compatibility with every third party plug in or technology on the market
8442630 oh thats a load of apple can do no wrong and the iphone is the best piece of technology ever created wahhh
8442631 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president
8442632 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with
8442633 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8442634 we have an outstanding quality of life in the pacific northwest that extends well beyond our city limits
8442635 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8442636 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged
8442637 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8442638 the time has come for a president who has lived the american dream who is on our side a president who will cut our dependence on foreign oil and lead us into the new energy frontier a president who will make us stronger and safer as americans
8442639 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country we support enthusiastically his plans to restore the american dream for american families and we stand united proudly in our determination to elect barack obama
8442640 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8442641 i think we need to see the united states and see the world through eyes that are younger through eyes that have dreams through eyes that see something new for the nation
8442642 we dont have a lot of time to unite the democratic party
8442643 that which historically divides us cannot divide us if we want barack obama to be president of the united states
8442644 barack needs illinoisans to love each other then he needs us to leave our front row seats and go hug ohio go hug michigan go hug florida
8442645 i am not going to be satisfied until i see rod blagojevich give mike madigan a hug
8442646 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8442647 for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need
8442648 make better health care and benefits for veterans a higher priority than tax cuts for exxon mobil and the wealthiest americans
8442649 today is the first day of the best days of your life
8442650 the sidewalks around it are no longer considered public spaces
8442651 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8442652 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8442653 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8442654 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8442655 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8442656 this election is likely to determine whether the supreme court will become more conservative in the short term
8442657 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8442658 higher and rising inflation is having an effect on pay negotiations in the private sector but pressure on profits is also a key part of the picture as the
8442659 is completely false our camp never approached the obama camp the obama and clinton camps were calling our office before the puerto rican primary trying to get yankee to endorse them the mccain camp approached us as well

8442698 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8442699 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that michelle obama watching from her seat in the balcony stood and applauded as the former president praised her man and obama delighting the crowd with his appearance on stage praised both clintons as well as his wife for their prime time speeches this week hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8442700 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8442701 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8442702 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks

8442728 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8442729 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

8442751 this time not a single person has given me a story i guess when you lose two elections in a row people learn from that
8442752 theres a sense that the parties are completely detached from the populist excitement that undergirds obamas appeal

8442759 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serio us threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world

8443007 i have not known mr peters to lie to me and i have to take people as i find them he is utterly convinced that he never made that call he and mr henry are utterly convinced that mr henry made the call

8443009 i understand that mr henry will be absolutely clear that he made the phone call
8443010 i am not their advocate i am not their defender i am simply saying that he will be totally clear about that

8443047 any doubts about why russia invaded georgia have now been erased
8443048 by illegally recognising the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force
8443049 moscow is using its invasion prepared over years to rebuild its empire seize greater control of europes energy supplies and punish those who believed democracy could flourish on its borders
8443050 moscow has flipped the kosovo precedent on its head where the west acted to prevent ethnic cleansing in georgia ethnic cleansing is being used by russia to consolidate its military annexation
8443051 the next step in russias invasion script of disinformation and annexation is regime change if moscow can oust georgias democratically elected government it can then intimidate other democratic european governments where will this end
8443052 the message is clear russia will do as it pleases

8443066 according to several industry sources outside of nintendo the company is working on an updated nintendo ds the screens are supposedly slightly bigger but the biggest change is that the new ds will apparently have two touch screens so its like a dual touch ds that way players can interact via the stylus with game play on both screens heres the kicker word has it that this announcement if true wont hit until early next year
8443067 i was able to get an extra ticket but most of the stars dont meet the fans anymore
8443068 then he gave her a hug autographed a program and the two talked hes very personable and interacts well with his fans
8443069 they said of all the athletes in special olympics she was the one they wanted for the ad
8443070 they gave her outfits for the shoot brought her to the beach and really treated her like a celebrity
8443071 they even gave her a radio controlled car and promised to give her a real one when she got her license
8443072 when that happened i went from being a coach back to being mom
8443073 i rushed to her side and she calmly asked me to step aside and let the medics do their job so she could get back to the competition
8443074 she had fluid building up in her ears and that was impeding her speech abilities
8443075 we had that drained and she hasnt stopped talking since
8443076 shell be doing a variety of things like sorting fishing tackle or placing inserts in the newspaper
8443077 since amanda was born people have always tried to hold her back
8443078 but she keeps rewriting the rules were all very proud of her
8443079 first were going to the doctor lucy then you can come to my house ok

8443084 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8443085 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8443086 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8443087 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8443088 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrests and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8443089 we are not interested in the possibilities of defeat they do not exist
8443090 right now its mixed the bottom line is when we come out of this convention well come out unified we always do and we will again
8443091 im hoping people are hurting enough now from the bush cheney policies that people are wise enough to understand that having mccain in there would be four more years of what we put up with for the last eight years
8443092 people saying hes not a known entity and thats true hes come very far in four years
8443093 his greatest challenge is to convince people that hed going to put together the kind of team that has enough experience to do this well its kind of the experience issue
8443094 its a bit of a trade off theres part of the electorate that likes that hes not a creature of washington d c
8443095 one of his strengths is that hes new and fresh and not locked into the washington establishment
8443096 my in laws and some of my family are republican
8443097 i cant go along with that we need a change in this county eight years ago there was a surplus now we have a huge deficit we had a preemptive war which we never before had in this countrys history
8443098 hamas hezbollah the taliban and dictators everywhere on the march
8443099 i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years
8443100 but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain
8443101 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8443102 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being before it before youre against it
8443103 i will always remember how we stood together in 2004 not just in a campaign but for a cause
8443104 now again we stand together in the ranks ready to fight
8443105 one of the more revolutionary developments in the worlds capital markets is the remarkable quickening pace of acceptance of a true lingua franca for accounting
8443106 it makes sense to have one set of standards but will it be applied and enforced in the same way in country x and here
8443107 this is a moon shot a lofty ambition there are a lot of things that have to be resolved

8443109 he has to have that resolved before anything is going to develop on that front theres nothing new on that score at the moment

8443137 its an incredible show of faith by nbc and so amazingly nice to get based on the work alone
8443138 this show has really hit its stride and deserves a full season commitment to carry out the producers vision for this unique series
8443139 the production has stepped up their game creatively as proven by the strong ratings
8443140 are putting their best foot forward as americans when we are in the tank
8443141 people who are unemployed want to get back to work
8443142 there is no moral high ground left in this administration
8443143 i think hes going to be very important to our state and the message that he is sending about the kind of change he wants to bring nationally is the kind of change weve made happen in our home state

8443145 its like the fascination that young people have here with football
8443146 this is fantastic news there have been a lot of rumours about cadel leaving for another team but i am happy to be able to count on him till 2010
8443147 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in djokovic said
8443148 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8443149 it is going to be a good two days djokovic said of his ankle
8443150 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8443151 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8443152 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty she said of one of her spills
8443153 naturally i wanted sharelle out there leading the team but knowing sharelles on court intensity it was not worth taking the risk and playing her at this stage plummer said
8443154 we are taking a conservative approach to ensure she gets her body right for next year and beyond
8443155 ultimately while she is disappointed to not be taking part in the international series this is about the long term welfare of sharelle mcmahon in the australia netball team
8443156 this is an important series but we are at the start of an exciting four year cycle that includes the commonwealth games and world championships mcmahon said
8443157 if rushing back now without being fully fit puts these longer term goals in jeopardy then it isnt worth the risk

8443159 i think we forget the things that are most memorable about a period of history when we are making it definitely the minutia of every day often overshadows the truly important things

8443165 we usually give five to seven grants of about 50 000 less than that each year
8443166 the key thing is we expect to be able to award that much or more every year now thanks to mr cleve
8443167 his money is a huge gift and its great our community supports other parts of our community like this
8443168 with the high gas cost our van is spending the money getting around

8443180 he then saw flames coming up in their living room
8443181 he ran across the road and called out to see if anyone was inside and then heard a girl calling for help and saying all the doors were locked
8443182 she was screaming and my husband was trying to hold her back because she was trying to get inside
8443183 hes just that type of person hell act without thinking but im very proud of him
8443184 cheers to another workout podcaster for what its worth i recommend media matters with bob mcchesney and the ricky gervais show
8443185 im with the others here who think lieberman would be too awful of a choice for mccain to make
8443186 its pointless to try and apply reason to media political figures like dobbs but his framing of illegal immigrants as part of the
8443187 it doesnt surprise me that the right manages to contradict itself every four years or so but there are similarities here to the inexperienced gwb picking dick cheney in 2000 superficial similarities of course but what was once good is now bad up is down etcetera
8443188 improved disclosures alone cannot solve all of the problems consumers face in trying to manage their credit card accounts
8443189 would severely curtail the ability of creditors to react to adverse changes in a borrowers risk characteristics during the term of the account
8443190 has a lot of language in their letter saying that we support reform but then they attack the most important piece of the proposal
8443191 water down its regulation underscores the need to pass credit card reform legislation
8443192 yeah the wait is the downside id be sweating about all the time away from work but then im finding it hard to stay focused anyway
8443193 thanks mary im very jealous that you got a ticket tomorow im going to miss the big one i know its tough to keep up on here
8443194 i cant help but notice that its we southerners who are gaga for bipartisanship edgar alverson is in ga im in nc
8443195 we see who you project yourself to be but is it really possible you have the same interests and concerns we have
8443196 the good news is we have brett denney and bernard afutiti to help us with that until his return
8443197 they were within three percentage points heading into tuesdays practice
8443198 why dont you ask one of them pointing to a row of delegates if you can get in
8443199 well no one is sitting in that seat why dont you sit there
8443200 we need it we need more of it too we need the grown ups to grow up and do the work that the voters elected them to do
8443201 at nikon we want to continue to lead the industry in pioneering photography solutions and give our customers access to innovative technology
8443202 this agreement is a natural extension of our longstanding relationship with microsoft and we look forward to collaborating and bringing exciting new products to the market
8443203 this agreement will extend and enhance our already successful long standing collaboration with nikon and will allow us to provide even better products to our customers
8443204 this agreement is another great example of how industry leaders are coming together to collaborate through intellectual property licensing and by doing so enabling innovation which that will ultimately benefit the consumer
8443205 we are proud of the quality of our broad global patent portfolio and we are pleased to be working with an industry leader like nikon
8443206 the breadth of performance sea kayaking is fairly astounding this video should be in your library
8443207 this video hits the mark quite neatly anyone watching this could not fail to pick up the most important points of long boat handling navigation skills and some basic rescues
8443208 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice
8443209 breadth depth and details make this video demand more than a one time survey a comprehensive sea kayaking instructional textbook
8443210 we bought one for rental but discovered people want to own it so now we sell lots of them
8443211 if you are serious about learning to sea kayak the video is well worth the price
8443212 well come out of this cycle stronger with less competition from players on the fringe who do silly things
8443213 the external environment in the markets and in the media is harsher today
8443214 most people dont understand the strength that came out of that experience
8443215 this is a higher quality bank with a great footprint
8443216 theyve been dragged down by a function of whats going on in their markets
8443217 when the storm moves past zions growth rate will return to a nice strong clip
8443218 once they see the yellow lights start flashing on the bus they know within 150 feet to 300 feet that bus is actually going to stop to pick up the students
8443219 once they see the yellow lights they need to start slowing down to be prepared to stop
8443220 it truthfully makes me very upset and angry that someone could be that selfish and impatient to endanger children
8443221 when the u s invaded iraq it didnt do so to improve irans power position in the region but that was the result
8443222 that wasnt the purpose of the russian invasion of georgia either but it too may be the result
8443223 the reason is on grounds of principle if iran is going to start supporting the secession of territories that are unhappy with the central government then iran itself has some similar issues with ethnic dissatisfaction
8443224 dont view russia as a reliable partner they understand that russia may support iran on the nuclear file depending on its own security or policy interests but russia has also been quite clever in using iran as a bargaining chip in terms of its relationship with the united states
8443225 the iranians are being very clever here theyre not likely to rush to russias defence unless russia comes to them and ask for their help and then they can ask for something in return
8443226 oil and gas companies now must factor in a new level of uncertainty
8443227 georgia is now unstable and that increases the risk of transporting hydrocarbons across it
8443228 if the btc and georgia wont be a reliable source of energy then iran will absolutely step up to the plate
8443229 you want gas well sell you gas will likely be their position
8443230 i think the swiss are a very good bellwether for the rest of europe on this
8443231 see the present crisis as an opportunity to go back to european colleagues and say lets take another look at this
8443232 it gives them some more leverage by going to the west and saying youre shooting yourselves in the foot here
8443233 the question is whether bush and cheney will feel empowered to behave in a more belligerent fashion or not
8443234 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8443235 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that being was wrong because i didnt hear anything at all at all from him just nothing
8443236 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey
8443237 they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8443238 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8443239 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8443240 when you dont hear any news for a while youre kind of worried
8443241 everybody was kind of wondering what he was going to do
8443242 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8443243 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8443244 we talked a little bit this summer but you want to give the guy some room you dont want to bug him every time you talk im just glad hes back youre a much better team with joe sakic on your team
8443245 i dont care if hes 39 hes such a special player hes such a special human being im pumped im excited to see him coming on the ice i cant emphasize enough what he brings to the team
8443246 our entire organization is very excited to have joe back for another season
8443247 as the only captain of the avalanche his record of achievement speaks for itself having him return is great for our franchise and community but also for the game of hockey
8443248 hes done everything for this organization i think thats the way francois was thinking and i think it was the right approach we tried to give him the respect that he earned and tried not to bring it up every single time we talked to him
8443249 any time you get a player like joe coming back for another year its great news
8443250 i was optimistic that he was coming back at the same time if he didnt come back it wouldnt be the end of the world our job is to go out and play the best we can whether thats with joe or without him
8443251 but hey trust me im one of the happiest people that joes coming back were much better off with a player of joes caliber along with what he brings off the ice
8443252 the u s government continues to invest over 1 billion in abstinence only education that does not advocate condom usage and has proven to be ineffective
8443253 continue to be in effect though 60 per cent of primetime content is sexual in nature
8443254 its all so amazing because a few years ago i was just some opinionated guy who got agitated at dinner parties
8443255 now ive got a floor pass and i find it rather shocking
8443256 we use journalistic tools but we have a definite point of view id say blogs are a hybrid of journalism editorial writing and talk shows
8443257 im not going to begin trade negotiations here at a press conference at the democratic convention
8443258 senator obama values the trade relationship with canada and canada is a very very crucial trading partner for us
8443259 some of the happiest people in the world americans have a great fondness and a great feeling about our cross border relationship
8443260 i have total confidence that senator obama will work closely with canada to make sure we have a strong trading relationship going forward
8443261 i made the transition it wasnt hard others are adjusting a lot of them are hard core i try to give them a hug and tell them we have to stay together for the party
8443262 she had the experience and judgment to be president now in a first for me im supporting a republican
8443263 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads
8443264 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8443265 i have four people in the office and five people at the house and i dont even have a job
8443266 why it takes that many people to sustain me is hard to explain
8443267 i do not find stories images of nude adults adults engaged in sexual acts or other sexual material to be offensive or objectionable
8443268 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels
8443269 could and should have been taken into account in sentencing
8443270 he mr glenn stated his view then that he had contributed money whether it was to new zealand first or to some other fund thats lost in the mists of time but as i say at every time that this issue has arisen i have rung mr peters and asked for his word
8443271 i have not known mr peters to lie to me and i have to take people as i find them he is utterly convinced that he never made that call he and mr henry are utterly convinced that mr henry made the call
8443272 i am really not in a position to adjudicate i am in the position where an honourable members word has been given and its been given in parliament as well as in many other places
8443273 i understand that mr henry will be absolutely clear that he made the phone call
8443274 i am not their advocate i am not their defender i am simply saying that he will be totally clear about that
8443275 i think the handling obviously leaves a great deal to be desired and perhaps the legacy of that is mr peters relationship with the news media is a very confrontational one and one that he almost delights in having but it doesnt make for good handling of difficult issues
8443276 i dont think anything mr key does ties two other parties together
8443277 who we work with after the next election will entirely depend on what deck of cards the electorate send us

8443286 most company directors are blissfully unaware of the administrative or privileged passwords that their it guys have access to which allows them to see everything that is going on within the company these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as its often considered too much hassle
8443287 our advice is secure the most privileged data and routinely change and manage them so that if an employees contract is terminated whether sacked or made redundant they cant maliciously play havoc inside the network or vindictively steal data for competitive or financial gain

8443309 i think its because i was close to death and i want to make as many contributions as possible while im breathing
8443310 im a person who can prioritize and juggle i love a challenge and i love setting priorities and the priorities at melrose wakefield hospital will be the patients
8443311 you have to have leaders who listen embrace change and are willing to hear when things are not going well
8443312 they have to be willing to improve the quality safety and patient satisfaction
8443313 being negative is an so i try every day to remain positive
8443314 i remember in microbiology i happened to mention to one of my male colleagues that i was petrified of the rodent family someone found out and they cut off the head of a rat and when i changed slides i looked down and saw to pairs of eyes
8443315 at the time i was dating my first husband and we decided we wanted to get married and have a family i went into interior decorating and became a i did that for four years
8443316 i ended up scoring very high in nursing and physician
8443317 i was very focused and on target to becoming a nurse specialist
8443318 i spent 20 years in critical care and emergency care
8443319 i was in the icu and there was a nurse there who made such a difference in my life
8443320 i didnt know anyone when i got there but i made some lifelong friends
8443321 i got through the year and i loved being a cardiovascular critical care clinical nurse specialist
8443322 the chief nursing officer said i should go into administration
8443323 she said i loved influencing patient care but now i could influence the complete environment
8443324 i remember interviewing with hallmark president and ceo michael sack
8443325 we really hit it off i had a criteria in what i wanted in a ceo and i told him i was very participatory that i wanted the nurses to have a voice and that i wanted to govern the day to day practice i told him what i needed
8443326 he wanted to meet to raise the standard of care
8443327 these were doctors who were old school and wanted the nurses to be hand maidens who followed them around all day long
8443328 i want to see patient satisfaction consistently greater than the 90th percentile
8443329 you are absolutely the most difficult person to shop for
8443330 he simply doesnt have the integrity in my view unless he can somehow change that
8443331 as far as i am concerned there comes a point where enough is enough
8443332 picture of perversion his lawyer told auckland district court yesterday
8443333 the defence says what he did with each of these patients was to carry out perfectly proper medical procedures what he believed to be the appropriate way to provide information for the hospital staff
8443334 we decided that rather than have the entire surplus go towards the debt as was required under the old law we should have a new law that dedicates part of that surplus to a priority of our choosing
8443335 this year we chose ontario municipalities not health care or education although theres no shortage of demand there we chose you our municipal partners
8443336 we chose you so that you can invest in the infrastructure you need in your roads and bridges your transit or your social housing whatever your infrastructure priorities might be
8443337 i was not surprised when jaclyn won she was a dedicated employee and student and volunteered for community service and played sports its not an easy thing to do
8443338 more than half of mcdonalds canada top management team and canadian owner operators started as crew in a mcdonalds restaurant
8443339 the experience of those municipalities that allow the bags as liners is that they are a convenient bag for the resident who does not want to clean out their green bin after collection day however plastic bag contamination can occur due to some residents use of plastic shopping bags or other plastic bag products
8443340 to help avoid contamination issues the county would need to start an education campaign letting residents know what bags are acceptable and are non acceptable
8443341 other contamination can also occur because the collection driver cannot always clearly see what is in the bag and hence the contents may be taken even if there are nonacceptable materials in it however training with the collection drivers will take place to ensure that they are aware of the different bags and the potential for non acceptable items in the bags
8443342 sometimes we take the economical route by not hiring specialists
8443343 it is those people close to us and our community who have made this both emotionally and financially easier

8443356 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8443357 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8443358 i am really proud of the position and its good to work with a private foundation like that
8443359 its sad that the money raised was through someones funeral but it has raised the awareness among the community and young women its a really good legacy to carry on with

8443365 they took her in for a psychological test i was told to wait outside
8443366 then they gave me something to sign and i signed it said she was mentally retarded but i had no idea what that meant
8443367 but that doesnt make up for the years shes lost the years when you learn to read write and count i cant even send her shopping all she can do now is manual work
8443368 in the first grade in a normal school the kids can count to 20 here they can only count to five although we want to teach them numbers up to 10
8443369 normally the children would learn this at fourth grade but these kids keep forgetting things so you have to keep repeating them
8443370 i blame the parents they dont read to their kids the roma have no appreciation that you have to apply yourself to get on they just live for the day
8443371 we cant say to those who teach like this you have to go that would lead to a collapse of the school system
8443372 i want to see in two years that teachers in schools with a high percentage of roma children have appropriate training and i want to see a major shift in these schools but i cant say tomorrow you have to change the philosophy youve been teaching with for 20 years
8443373 i wasnt at a special school because my parents were strict with me
8443374 czech people are racist and xenophobic but many gypsies are worse they dont send their kids to school because they dont want them to be white its a big mistake we can talk about racism but we live in a democratic country and everyone can make choices
8443375 they send us their children and we try to send them back to a normal school but they like to have their kids in schools where the other sinti are
8443376 the parents of many of the children in special or sub standard schools are themselves the products of a discriminatory educational environment that will affect their childrens chances
8443377 so there are problems within many affected communities but the principal burden rests on government to make clear that discrimination must end

8443387 as a veteran of operation iraqi freedom i am honored to speak on behalf of over 27 000 members of vets for freedom in offering our strong endorsement of tim bee for the united states congress
8443388 senator bee understands that the fight we are currently undertaking in iraq is essential to our success in the global fight against islamic extremism he recognizes and acknowledges the success of our current military strategy implemented by general petraeus and has been a steadfast source of support of all the men and women who are winning the global war on terror our country needs more dedicated people like tim in washington

8443395 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8443396 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8443397 over the last 60 years the number of people who are severely overweight has risen steadily and there is a very real danger that todays children will not live longer than their parents
8443398 as part of the strategy this autumn we will be launching a national movement that will bring about a fundamental change in the way we live our lives
8443399 the change4life movement will not hector or point the finger it will give everyone wherever they live the information and support they need to eat more healthily and be more active
8443400 tough action is necessary and the tough action our reform demands will be rewarded
8443401 the government is committed to investing substantially in our schools to deliver better outcomes but were not making investments without demanding accountability in return
8443402 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8443403 kids going to average schools deserve any opportunity that kids at flash schools have and this is the way there
8443404 weve seen what league tables can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table
8443405 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8443406 the coalition welcomes the fact that mr rudd is now following our agenda for higher standards and quality in schools but talk is no substitute for action
8443407 mr rudds pressing priority is to lift economic confidence and certainty for australians and australian businesses that are worse off under his government

8443426 thats not whats going on we have a lack of training lack of appropriate personnel
8443427 sometimes we have some of our least trained qualified folks at those levels providing direct care services
8443428 and if we need salary provisions and those kinds of things to hire the appropriate people to run these hospitals we need to do it and we need to do it as soon as we can

8443457 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a trans racial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8443458 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8443459 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8443460 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8443461 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8443462 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8443463 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8443464 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did

8443529 but when you have a well recognized hazard like coal mine dust
8443530 the only thing it gets you is additional years of rulemaking and that translates into delayed protection

8443541 the love of christ is evident in his outreach and his passion for souls he stands for everything we believe in and has been mercilessly persecuted by the chinese government
8443542 the chinese government has continued to step over the bounds of rule of law by not allowing true religious freedom to take place in china
8443543 the chinese governments illegal arrest and detainment of a man as selfless and patriotic as pastor zhang mingxuan may have negated any positive strides china had shown to the world during the olympic games

8443580 demand will pick up from the food side as well as biodiesel
8443581 this will mainly be for people with flex fuel vehicles but it could be for regular cars very soon
8443582 we hope this also helps promote the sales of more flex fuel vehicles
8443583 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
8443584 all this can be done within our current budget by ending wasteful and damaging biofuels subsidies
8443585 while cost savings may be a key driver for water conservation companies that do so demonstrate to customers that they are adopting best environmental practice this in itself offers a competitive advantage
8443586 we think zephyr is very close to an operational system within the next two years is what were aiming for
8443587 we have one more step of improvements we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months and we want to push the performance
8443588 there are many reasons an organisation would want to move toward biodiesel including environmental benefits and reducing consumption of imported petroleum

8443612 buffy the vampire slayer slaying church attendance among women study claims
8443613 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
8443614 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
8443615 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
8443616 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
8443617 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
8443618 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do
8443619 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men

8443622 we wanted to monitor the deterioration of the scrolls and realized we needed to take precise photographs to watch the process thats when we decided to do a comprehensive set of photos both in color and infrared to monitor selectively what is happening we realized then that we could make the entire set of pictures available online to everyone meaning that anyone will be able to see the scrolls in the kind of detail that no one has until now
8443623 every undergraduate will be able to have a detailed look at them from numerous angles
8443624 mom ill bet ree likes your painting a lot nell looks so real
8443625 i feel a bit upset that i have been quoted as saying the idea of a scottish olympic team is ridiculous
8443626 if and when a scottish team was put together i would be delighted to represent scotland in the olympic games
8443627 but before that happens so much needs to be done for the athletes to be able to compete at the highest level
8443628 as a cyclist there isnt a facility in scotland where i can train throughout the year and thats why i have to base myself outside scotland
8443629 i am proud to be scottish but at the same time its not feasible to think we can compete as a nation without the right facilities
8443630 i watched my country turn into a coast to coast strip mall and i cried out in a song if we can do all this in 30 years then please tell me you all why does good change take so long

8443647 the municipal water supply is more stringently tested than bottled water supplies in canada the cbc reports that local water supplies are inspected every day while bottled water plants are inspected just once every three years in addition according to msn news water bottling plants are required to test for coliform bacteria just once a week whereas most municipal water systems test for the bacteria several times a day
8443648 before reaching for bottled water canadians need to think about the serious environmental consequences of their water choice
8443649 according to the pacific institute the energy required to produce plastic water bottles for the american market alone in 2006 was equivalent to more than 17 million barrels of oil and created 2 5 million tons of carbon dioxide
8443650 the buried bottles take up to 1 000 years to biodegrade and may leak toxic additives into the groundwater the incinerated bottles release toxic chemicals into our air moreover some of the bottles make their way into our oceans where they break down into increasingly tiny pieces and can enter the food chain when theyre eaten by marine animals and birds
8443651 how much easier it is to be critical than to be correct
8443652 it was quite an education to reach the top only to find that no one ever gets there
8443653 what do you want to do tonight i dont know what do you want to do tonight
8443654 more than 75 percent of canadians consume bottled water each and every day
8443655 they worked hard but i think in the third they didnt work too hard coming back into their own end

8443676 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8443677 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

8443703 it might be the only way we can get to him
8443704 try and think of it like this gabriels first target will be the globenet backbone servers right and once they go down thats it all intercontinental comms grind to a halt theyll try to cut the backbones out of the loop convert to a distributed web like the nations have done but thatll take em days and even then theyll still be vulnerable presuming those irish robots are as nasty as hideo thinks in fact were probably the biggest threats to this whole plan in the whole
8443705 no ill get hideo to lend us a jet but we cant just fly down and nuke ireland or whatever the hell youre thinking we need to do this properly doom potatos in charge of ireland number nine in the ranks and if he knows about this then we have to give him a trial and a chance to explain himself well need to get the fifteen together

8443720 most company directors are blissfully unaware of the administrative or privileged passwords that their it guys have access to which allows them to see everything that is going on within the company
8443721 these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as its often considered too much hassle when people leave the organisation they can often still access the network using these passwords to acquire an organisations most sensitive information
8443722 our advice is secure the most privileged data and routinely change and manage them
8443723 so that if a workers contract is terminated whether sacked or made redundant they cant maliciously play havoc inside the network or vindictively steal data for competitive or financial gain
8443724 you can install the best security systems in the world but if your staff do not respect the information they are entrusted with then the information will definitely go astray just as the findings of this survey have illustrated

8443743 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8443744 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8443745 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
8443746 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
8443747 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
8443748 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
8443749 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8443750 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities
8443751 even if your manager has the sense to tell you to use your discretion and judgment if you think you want to take a quick stroll through the plant youre often not going to have the time to do it anyway
8443752 there was information gathered through either staff or inmates that there was an escape plan
8443753 but they couldnt determine what unit was involved which inmates whether it was from inside the unit or outside the prison on maybe an escort or something so they were just trying to glean some of that information
8443754 they said that there was no specific intelligence to this breakout happening on that unit with those inmates
8443755 if the intelligence was specific then we should have been locking down the prison in this case with no specifics they didnt feel it necessary to lock down the whole prison
8443756 inside the unit preliminary investigation has determined that some of the bricks were in fact removed
8443757 the hole was big enough for a person to fit through thats pretty obvious
8443758 the ministry officials have told me they cant determine if they climbed over the fence or how they got out of the yard
8443759 our members have been working with management to improve the current system which is not working but to date many issues remain unresolved
8443760 we believe there are systemic problems that need to be addressed
8443761 we dont have confirmation that theyre gang members we dont know if this had a role to play
8443762 only a person of good reputation can continue a crime like this
8443763 thats why it is such a significant breach of trust
8443764 he had a great first year and most coaches in their second season do well
8443765 at offensive line the next three to go in are freshmen and at safety we could have an issue in a hurry with another injury
8443766 we had to some things at fullback but everywhere else were okay
8443767 friendfeeds user base has grown quite a bit since launch and our servers now download millions of feeds from over 43 services every hour
8443768 t he benefits are most significant when the sup feed covers a large number of other feeds
8443769 sup consumers must be somewhat intelligent when consuming feeds in order to poll at the appropriate frequency but our goal was to make things as simple as possible for sup producers in the hopes that most sites will be able to quickly implement a sup feed
8443770 is a very simple and common data format that is now supported by just about every common language it is also very compact which is a real advantage for sup feeds that may have thousands of entries an xml based sup feed could be easily generated but its not clear that there would be any advantage and it could easly end up being 3 5 times as large
8443771 i have never met a japanese man who did not want me to be his mommy
8443772 this suggests that the decrease in fertility is due almost entirely to an increase in women of reproductive age not getting married and not having children
8443773 we need to organize our society so that women and families will be able to raise children while working
8443774 i think we still lack adequate efforts on that front
8443775 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8443776 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8443777 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8443778 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8443779 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8443780 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8443781 we suspect that bdnf has important issues in many parts of the brain including memory and ability to sense pain
8443782 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8443783 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8443784 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8443785 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8443786 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8443787 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

8443794 removal rates can vary from almost zero to 100 percent depending on the active pharmaceutical ingredient youre considering
8443795 we want to build the social will to create a national take back program

8443803 im going to cast my vote for senator obama if hillary clinton says shes going to cast her vote for senator
8443804 is not anti barack obama its very much pro hillary clinton
8443805 you could argue that no ones every ready to be president
8443806 my horse is out of the race im getting out to work for obama
8443807 i think there are a few delegates who need to vote for hillary to reach that point of closure
8443808 the story is that we are working as a team
8443809 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8443810 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8443811 you know iran they spend one 100 th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8443812 i dont know any reason why they would reach that conclusion i dont have anything to do with the investigation thats going on i have not done anything illegal in any way shape or form
8443813 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8443814 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8443815 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8443816 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits
8443817 in any job or any career the first year or two youre learning whether its for you
8443818 the person that brought it to my attention did ask does that mean if youre mute you cant play golf on the lpga tour
8443819 do you have to pass an exam who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8443820 some people are natural talkers and some people arent what if you have a person who genuinely struggles with learning a new language they have a learning disability
8443821 there are people out there who dont naturally pick up second languages
8443822 this is going to be a coming of age of american food
8443823 we need a new food system in america we need a new food system that supports the people who are taking care of the land supports the small farmers that feeds the children something thats nourishing
8443824 this is an event to birth a more political food movement were operating in a context where its become blatantly obvious that were eating ourselves to death in america
8443825 we are still on track the process has speeded up and governments are very serious about negotiating a result in copenhagen
8443826 accra has laid the foundation of what could serve as a first negotiating text for a copenhagen deal
8443827 countries have made it very clear that issue of forests need to be part of a copenhagen deal
8443828 thats important because emissions from deforestation account for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
8443829 parties were deeply committed and submitted proposals for solutions on the issues
8443830 all in all the group has made good progress its important to take this progress forward in pozna when we return to the issue of the ranges of emissions reductions for developed countries under the kyoto protocol
8443831 one of the cdms shortcomings is that it is not leading to enough investments in africa
8443832 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that take into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth
8443833 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8443834 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8443835 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8443836 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8443837 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8443838 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8443839 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8443840 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8443841 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8443842 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8443843 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8443844 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8443845 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8443846 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8443847 as an organization that started as a small guerilla group the tigers will retain their capacity to go back to their origins
8443848 the havoc that even a small group of determined persons can do is inestimable
8443849 security forces killed 25 30 militants including some important commanders and foreigners in bajaurs raghan region

8443864 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8443865 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8443866 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that michelle obama watching from her seat in the balcony stood and applauded as the former president praised her man and obama delighting the crowd with his appearance on stage praised both clintons as well as his wife for their prime time speeches this week hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8443867 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8443868 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8443869 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8443870 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8443871 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8443872 i mean you got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
8443873 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is its awful hard with only a little bit of experience to have a clear sense of what you would do on the most critical issues facing us today
8443874 whoever the next president is is going to have to know what he or she wants to do beyond a tactical move in other words there is a tactic and a strategy putting a cap on troops is a tactic cutting funding is a tactic making judgment about surging is a tactic but at the
8443875 they are aircraft and types of accident that are not related to each other at all
8443876 the geographical split has become more extreme over the years
8443877 accidents in north america europe and asia with the exception of indonesia have become fantastically rare
8443878 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8443879 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8443880 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8443881 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8443882 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8443883 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8443884 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8443885 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8443886 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8443887 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8443888 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8443889 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8443890 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8443891 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8443892 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8443893 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8443894 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8443895 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8443896 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8443897 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8443898 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8443899 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8443900 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8443901 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8443902 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8443903 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8443904 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8443905 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8443906 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8443907 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8443908 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8443909 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8443910 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8443911 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8443912 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8443913 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8443914 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8443915 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8443916 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8443917 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8443918 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8443919 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8443920 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8443921 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8443922 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself

8444036 your performance tonight exceeded my expectations it was such a special evening
8444037 the x girls are a talented group of gorgeous dancers and their new burlesque project brings an energetic and sexy production to the resort
8444038 we like to keep x fresh and have something new for the fans to see the producers brought in
8444039 our performances are more about the art of burlesque we try to stay true to what burlesque was back in its heyday the sometimes frilly sometimes shiny and always sexy burlesque costumes help turn back the clock and bring back the pin up era if only during the performances whether its a fan dance a snake charmer skit a holiday inspired routine or the classic shimmy vintage burlesque groups like babes in sin are the intelligent alternative to the modern girls gone wild burlesque has more visual foreplay and as cha cha pictured right notes
8444040 for me its been great being part of this troupe has really done a lot for me i have an outlet to be creative though my choreography and costume design i really have fun with my numbers i try to add a little humor or a trick to my performances i am also know to twirl my tassel like no other
8444041 i go with my best friend summer who is also in the show with me we go to places like bebe bebe sport charlotte rouse and guess we just like to go try on clothes and sometimes buy matching stuff we usually go get something to eat too
8444042 the first stop is at the candy shop and i buy enough to last me all day long and especially gummy fish
8444043 i usually end up spending too much money i always buy clothes and especially shoes i like the fashion show mall the best
8444044 its total chaos i like to buy clothes makeup and accessories like shoes i like to shop at boca park and stay within my budget
8444045 i like to go to the fashion show mall and pretty much buy whatever catches my eye i like bebe and abercrombie im usually never looking for anything in particular
8444046 i buy shoes at bee bee sport at the fashion show mall i may spend a half a day to a whole day

8444050 the fact that rice met with both negotiation teams separately then together proves what she said in the press conference about both sides abstaining from negotiating in front of the media all this indicates that the negotiations are serious
8444051 it is regrettable that the israelis leak what they have to media while we palestinians dont that is why you find us frustrated as nothing comes out of the negotiation process

8444057 the chaplaincy at eastbourne contacted us after some kids said there was a body floating in the water
8444058 we were preparing to retrieve the body when all of a sudden a car drove off the cliff at the same time
8444059 we made our way to the car as it was more likely the man in the vehicle would still be alive
8444060 the tide was in which made it very difficult a coastguard helicopter spotted the second mans body in the water he had been thrown clear of the car
8444061 we made our way to the car as it was more likely the man in the vehicle would still be alive
8444062 obviously that sort of thing does happen quite a lot at beachy head but the fact that this person drove off at the same time as we were preparing to remove a body has made it a little hard for us to take in

8444080 i wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells
8444081 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8444082 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8444083 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8444084 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8444085 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8444086 im sure there are other cases of hidden people in the rural areas
8444087 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8444088 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8444089 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8444090 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8444091 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8444092 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8444093 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8444094 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8444095 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8444096 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8444097 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept

8444101 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8444102 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8444103 are pretty convincing that were going to see increases in poverty as a result of food and fuel prices
8444104 comparing poverty across countries the role of purchasing power parities
8444105 in a region that has witnessed rapid economic growth it might be time to evaluate poverty incidence using a benchmark that reflects the regions dynamism

8444170 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8444171 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8444172 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8444173 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8444174 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8444175 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8444176 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8444177 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8444178 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8444179 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8444180 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8444181 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8444182 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8444183 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8444184 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8444185 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8444186 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8444187 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8444188 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8444189 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8444190 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8444191 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8444192 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8444193 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8444194 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8444195 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8444196 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8444197 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8444198 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8444199 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8444200 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8444201 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8444202 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8444203 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8444204 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8444205 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8444206 were in a bad way with health care so we need to get past party issues
8444207 we need to put the emphasis on making wise spending choices
8444208 we need more equipment and more security personnel at the border
8444209 prison is not a rehabilitation place its a punishment place
8444210 its up to them to rehabilitate themselves the only exception i would have is for those who are illiterate
8444211 i dont necessarily think it needs to be in our state constitution
8444212 the rest has been from people mailing me contributions hearing about my campaign and reading about it in the newspapers and checks are coming in
8444213 would not believe that doug would be stupid enough to accept contributions from those kinds of controversial individuals because it would crush him
8444214 if click wanted to give me money id be sitting on about 40 000 in cash right now
8444215 so he sends me a 390 check i didnt get a check from his wife his kids his uncle his cousins all these other folks and thats just so he can say yeah i support frank evidently he does he sent me a check but hes not helping me not in the least bit as a matter of fact hes working against me in my opinion
8444216 i have been a supporter of frank antenori and cannot tell you how disappointed i am in franks lack of judgment
8444217 i called frank this morning and told him that i could no longer support his candidacy i told him that i do not believe that he has a moral compass or the temperament to represent district 30
8444218 i think that if youre a charity and youre a nonprofit you should be funded on your own two feet
8444219 you shouldnt be running to the legislature and local government to fund your nonprofit that tells me that your nonprofit sucks and it wouldnt survive on its own and you have to run to the government to keep it going
8444220 if theyre a legitimate charity that serves a legitimate purpose then they would have no trouble raising private funding
8444221 we provide funding for 2 500 women and children in this community who are leaving violent situations and they leave with the clothes on their backs these are people who are leaving their homes in the middle of the night fleeing an abusive situation and have nowhere else to go
8444222 its just not wise to put something like this out because everyone is pretty sensitive to it
8444223 look it was a mistake why would we give our opponent something to hammer us with ramon is saying i did it on purpose its mudslinging
8444224 its never been an issue i didnt review the artwork usually i look for an address and specifications like what kind of paper they want to use
8444225 i understand why walt is mad i understand they pay a lot of money to be able to be a union printer on the other hand its important to realize that no malice was intended nor was it an attempt to deceive anyone
8444226 it was more the timing of certain things and the decisions we had to make in terms of spreading our resources as far as we can
8444227 were certainly not expanding staff frankly i dont know of any television station in the country that is
8444228 every day i read theres another company cutting back on staff
8444229 kold parent company raycom has had minimal cutbacks but its utilizing the resources weve had a reporter position open for a long time and we were looking for the best ways to fill that and we came to the conclusion that barbara would be the one who could get it done shes a great resource for our station
8444230 the other stations have their main male anchors tom mcnamara at kvoa channel 4 and guy atchley at kgun channel 9 doing 5 6 and 10
8444231 it was a logical move to put dan in there
8444232 there will be people who are used to watching barbara on the 5 p m newscast
8444233 what im trying to do is make people realize that barbaras not going away in fact shes going to be out in the field doing stories live in the 5 and the 6 slots it all boils down to television stations must utilize all the resources they can to make their product better i think there is a difference in having someone with the wealth of experience the knowledge of this market and the reporting skills to have her locked behind a desk for two newscasts a day i think were missing an opportunity
8444234 ill be sitting at the laptop and the next thing i know ill be talking with someone in another part of the world who is interested in a particular story
8444235 when youre in local news youll have people trying to reach you about a specific story but youre out covering another story when youre blogging and youre at the computer calling me on the skype line im getting an education
8444236 there are all types of blogs a site like tmz is clearly making money i am the anti tmz at least id like to think so
8444237 theres no doubt the traditional brick and mortar media is being impacted ive heard all sorts of drastic predictions about the future of the media landscape this is shaking up traditional brick and mortar media and youd better learn how to adapt
8444238 theres no doubt were going to still have running water the new moon is on saturday i think the bluegill should bed again on the new moon along with a few shellcracker that might have a little meat left on them
8444239 there were lots and lots and lots of fish caught
8444240 anything you throw in the water worms crankbaits rat l traps it doesnt matter the majority of them are 1 2 pounds but theyre getting a lot of them 5 8 pounds
8444241 my membership believes that right now there is not enough history to bring aboard bloggers
8444242 they dont really have any accountability they can post anything and it doesnt really matter while those of us in the association have accountability and have standards
8444243 personally i believe that as long as a guy has proven himself to be a guy who dedicates his profession to blogging he deserves to be taken seriously
8444244 the new york islanders have been at the front of the pack in allowing bloggers to attend games at nassau coliseum
8444245 we saw that blogging is becoming a major force on the internet and is a tool for news reporting
8444246 instead of shying away from it we wanted to dive right in
8444247 i like you so much but i dont want to screw things up
8444248 i know im a bad kisser but i really want to kiss you
8444249 sex and the city had given us women with meat on their bones clothes from midprice chains found on high street mothers and fathers and uncles who turned up and weighed in
8444250 gavin amp stacey the most endearing comedy about love to come to television since the manolos were packed up and put away
8444251 gavin amp stacey which began tuesday on bbc america became a hit in britain resting on the rather simple premise that no two people come together alone
8444252 gavin amp stacey would win that award and perhaps even some prize money its
8444253 since you provided a response to parent 1 type please provide a response to the parent 1 degree question
8444254 he mr glenn stated his view then that he had contributed money whether it was to new zealand first or to some other fund thats lost in the mists of time but as i say at every time that this issue has arisen i have rung mr peters and asked for his word
8444255 i have not known mr peters to lie to me and i have to take people as i find them he is utterly convinced that he never made that call he and mr henry are utterly convinced that mr henry made the call
8444256 i am really not in a position to adjudicate i am in the position where an honourable members word has been given and its been given in parliament as well as in many other places
8444257 i understand that mr henry will be absolutely clear that he made the phone call
8444258 i am not their advocate i am not their defender i am simply saying that he will be totally clear about that
8444259 i think the handling obviously leaves a great deal to be desired and perhaps the legacy of that is mr peters relationship with the news media is a very confrontational one and one that he almost delights in having but it doesnt make for good handling of difficult issues
8444260 i dont think anything mr key does ties two other parties together
8444261 who we work with after the next election will entirely depend on what deck of cards the electorate send us

8444276 why does our system work and by the looks of it far better
8444277 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time last week there were some really good players that got hurt around the nfl and you just hope it doesnt happen to you
8444278 oh i was surprised i didnt know what was going on
8444279 have chosen to arrange it like a mutant square dance
8444280 generally across the board weve had a strong us dollar in the past month he said from auckland this morning
8444281 there comes a time when the market takes a breather and takes a position
8444282 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8444283 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8444284 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8444285 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8444286 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8444287 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8444288 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8444289 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8444290 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8444291 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8444292 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8444293 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8444294 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8444295 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8444296 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8444297 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8444298 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8444299 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8444300 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8444301 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8444302 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8444303 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8444304 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8444305 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8444306 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8444307 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8444308 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8444309 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8444310 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8444311 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8444312 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8444313 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8444314 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8444315 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8444316 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8444317 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8444318 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8444319 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
8444320 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
8444321 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
8444322 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8444323 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8444324 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8444325 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8444326 we believe that the justice system will prevail and that our client will be found innocent
8444327 this case has no weight its a web of lies
8444328 were not tackling an entire issue where there are shades of gray were taking one comment one fact and getting to the bottom of it
8444329 what people will continue to want is some assistance in wading through all the information of the information age people want to know whats true and whats false and they want some help doing that and thats what we can do

8444337 our version of star trek is not exactly a prequel
8444338 it is in some ways and you will have to see it to label it exactly canon that is a word that was invented for star trek meaning does it fall within the continuity of this forty year puzzle but it was amazing when we went back to look at star trek no one had ever done the story about how the original crew came together
8444339 theres five thousand hours of star trek and no one ever covered how they all met laughs
8444340 so in a way that was liberating in that no one had stated how that happened exactly and because we had been fans truly who knew all those years sitting in front of the tv watching

8444344 new zealand is facing a serious economic challenge generated by the global credit crunch and steep rises in global commodity prices
8444345 these are the most complex and challenging set of economic forces we have confronted in at least two decades
8444346 the populist economic message and peoples anxieties and struggles really do trump the social issues that they might be a little more conservative on

8444369 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8444370 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8444371 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8444372 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8444373 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8444380 these comparisons are totally unacceptable and take credibility away from the very real objections made about these cuts
8444381 civilized political discourse as canadians gear up for what is expected to be a fall election
8444382 the comparison of canadas prime minister to nazi leader adolf hitler is obscene and offensive
8444383 such statements trivialize the holocaust and inject ugly rhetoric in what ought to be reasoned debate on real and pressing political issues
8444384 we must wonder about the sincerity of a government that recognizes the people of quebec as a nation when it does not hesitate to cut into the very heart of its existence culture

8444428 i knew clark was unethical but i never quite realised quite how unethical she is this is really disgusting she sat there while winston peters defamed audrey young and said nothing she knew that e mail from owen glenn was not fake and said nothing she thinks her only responsibility to the public of nz is to ask winston and accept without question anything he says that is not leadership that is not integrity that is a sad desperate attempt to remain in power no matter what
8444429 i have seen that statement and i have also seen the refutation of it by mr peters the matter is before the privileges committee there is clearly a conflict of evidence and i await the outcome of the committee
8444430 anyone looked at the top two stories on the stranded

8444445 i certainly think parents have the choice to opt out of an inclusive public system but they should pay for that schooling themselves
8444446 if they want their children to be in an exclusive religious school segregated by religion then i think thats where parents have to put up the money for that

8444464 ebay has often talked about the changes taking place in the marketplace and the younger demographic thats now using our website
8444465 we thought lets check in with some younger people give them a completely clean slate and see what they come up with in this way we could see what we need to do to address the needs of that audience
8444466 when we heard that saratoga high school had 21 students interested we were really excited
8444467 we knew students who were involved in the media arts had a whole host of skills and were looking for multimedia projects to work on
8444468 we came up with a list of students who might be interested and ended up with three great teams
8444469 ebay doesnt decide what the user wants the community does that
8444470 this is a great example of that interaction we got some wonderful suggestions with all of these designs
8444471 the use of fonts and graphics was fun and also very practical
8444472 their presentation was very well done thoroughly rehearsed and suggested elements that arent currently a part of our site
8444473 this group really captured all aspects of whats important to ebay and the viability of its web site
8444474 i can take what ive learned at ebay and apply it at school
8444475 it will really help me out when im looking for a job as well normally im not much of a team player but now i know what to expect and how i can manage people better if i become part of a team
8444476 what was unique about the project was that it had no limitations the question was simply what will ebay be like in 2015 it allowed us to stretch our imaginations and come up with some out there stuff
8444477 in only eight weeks we brainstormed created our prototype and planned and practiced our presentation the experience will help our group with future projects both in and out of school
8444478 baracks candidacy would not have been conceivable 50 years ago
8444479 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a trans racial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8444480 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8444481 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8444482 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8444483 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8444484 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8444485 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8444486 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did
8444487 to do what only great orators can do offer a compelling vision of the future thats what great oratory is its not just putting words together its putting the right words to match the historical moment
8444488 eu questiono a imparcialidade e a integridade jornal stica desta pizza
8444489 just like we saw many years ago a rise in teenage tooth erosion caused by the consumption of sugary fizzy drinks we are starting to see different causes presenting themselves now and one of those is wine
8444490 drinking and tasting wine is a large part of australian lifestyle and it is the high acidic rate of wine that causes that damage to teeth and can erode the enamel
8444491 when you consume anything that is acidic like these sugary drinks it is important to remember you should wait anywhere up to two hours before brushing your teeth
8444492 the acid will almost immediately start to eat away at your teeth and brushing can in fact scrape a lot of the enamel off your teeth
8444493 you should rinse with water and another good idea is to drink wine with cheese because it will neutralise the effect
8444494 saya kecewa sebab gerrard akan menjalani operasi besok 28 08 ia mendapat masalah pada pangkal pahanya kami tahu ini akan terjadi dan saya sangat terkejut saat membaca beberapa surat kabar yang menyebutkan bahwa ia akan bermain secepatnya kini kami baca gerrard akan menjalani operasi dan harus absen selama 10 15 hari
8444495 operasi itu tidak memakan waktu lama namun ia harus menjalaninya sebab ia menderita sakit di bagian itu pangkal paha ketika ia pergi bersama timnas kami mengetahui bahwa kami akan mendapat masalah ini begitu pula di pertandingan leg pertama

8444504 i think were more likely to be running away from you
8444505 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8444506 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8444507 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
8444508 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
8444509 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
8444510 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
8444511 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8444512 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities
8444513 even if your manager has the sense to tell you to use your discretion and judgment if you think you want to take a quick stroll through the plant youre often not going to have the time to do it anyway
8444514 there was information gathered through either staff or inmates that there was an escape plan
8444515 but they couldnt determine what unit was involved which inmates whether it was from inside the unit or outside the prison on maybe an escort or something so they were just trying to glean some of that information
8444516 the hole was big enough for a person to fit through thats pretty obvious
8444517 they were a lot bigger than i thought being raised in captivity
8444518 by the time theyre older than two they have absorbed everything learned everything but we dont try to teach an old bear new tricks

8444556 after all respect for property rights is really in most cases shorthand for respect by the have nots for the property rights of the haves
8444557 author also fails to acknowledge what economic libertarians really say that it s immoral to take what is not yours whether it belongs to someone in the 001 percentile or in the 90th percentile
8444558 the fallacy of this argument is that human beings do not measure their well being by absolute real income or longevity
8444559 why should i work my butt off when i see my paycheck shrinking in terms of what i can afford to feed my family pay my mortgage and pay my ever increasing insurance premiums and uncovered medical expenses
8444560 a less educated person would be more prone to many of the problems cited by the author if so should these people be rewarded for the choices they have made
8444561 the paradox of economic growth is that the same mechanisms that create great wealth
8444562 they get richer and more powerful in the usa because they were rich and powerful to begin with i
8444563 those who think that these problems are primarily the result of voluntary lifestyle choices should reflect on the difficulty of providing a family of four with fresh fruits and vegetables on a minimum wage salary
8444564 the determining factor is not in most cases luck you don t get a hired based on luck you don t get a promotion because you win the promotion lottery at your job
8444565 if individuals cannot keep enough of what they earn then they will not produce
8444566 this is likely the reason why supply side economics fails in the real world
8444567 corporate taxes are found to be most harmful for growth followed by personal income taxes and then consumption taxes
8444568 since when good education is available to everyone in usa regardless of income and social status of their family
8444569 the last quarter century has witnessed remarkable progress of mankind the world s per capita inflation adjusted income rose from 5400 in 1980 to 8500 in 2005 schooling and life expectancy grew rapidly while infant mortality and poverty fell just as fast compared to 1980 many more countries in the world are democratic today the last quarter century also saw wide acceptance of free market policies in both rich and poor countries from private ownership to free trade to responsible budgets to lower taxes three important events mark the beginning of this period in 1979 deng xiao ping started market reforms in china which over the quarter century lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the same year margaret thatcher was elected prime minister in britain and initiated her radical reforms and a long period of growth a year later ronald reagan was elected president of the united states and also embraced free market policies all three of these leaders professed inspiration from the work of milton friedman it is natural then to refer to the last quarter century as the age of milton friedman
8444570 sorry but youre poor and need to be kicked in this life because you did something horrible to someone or something at some point in another life which we cant remember have no evidence of

8444572 the rich are rich because they deserve to be rich
8444573 the current income disparities are nearly identical to those of early 20th century american robber baron capitalism
8444574 it is no accident that the u s with the highest income inequality among the world s developed nations also has the highest incidence of obesity
8444575 do this and see what socialism will do to the next generations so sad

8444577 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8444578 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8444579 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8444580 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8444581 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8444582 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8444583 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up
8444584 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8444588 checking in from denver colorado i can report that contemporary art is alive and well out here during the height of campaign frenzy
8444589 i was reading my book the driver honked the horn slammed on the brakes and the train goes squish
8444590 not much was going through my head stuff happens i used to be with search and rescue and ive seen this from the other side often enough
8444591 everyone basically just grabbed their cellphones called 911 and made sure everybody was ok
8444592 considering the train did derail and depending on the volume of passengers that could have been on the train and if it were a different time of day things could have been substantially worse
8444593 the driver as well as a patient we took sustained the brunt of the collision because it was at the front of the train but even he is in stable condition at this point in time
8444594 all i can say at this point is there was a miscommunication as to whether or not the boom was supposed to be over the track when the train hit it
8444595 i would say its unlikely that there will be any criminal charges from the police end i imagine it would be something that occupational health and safety and their own departments look at as far as the people involved will be dealt with
8444596 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time

8444604 i still have the memory of him giving it to me
8444605 the sport has been mixed up in politics and that has put even more pressure on the athletes especially our baseball players they are athletes not soldiers
8444606 auf diesem niveau machen kleinigkeiten den unterschied aus atletico hat heute seine m glichkeiten genutzt wir leider nicht
8444607 du musst in so einem gro en spiel ausw rts ein tor erzielen das ist uns nicht gelungen
8444608 nach dem 0 2 kurz nach der halbzeit mussten wir nun einmal risiko gehen
8444609 in der phase haben wir kaum chancen zugelassen das 0 2 kurz nach der pause hingegen ist zu einem f r uns sehr ung nstigen zeitpunkt gefallen
8444610 nat rlich tut diese niederlage den fans und der mannschaft weh
8444611 same as it ever was better than yours at least
8444612 this is the best level we have achieved since the asian financial crisis when npls stood at 13 6 per cent on december 1998
8444613 wir haben alle zu wenig gemacht um weiter zu kommen
8444614 das 0 2 hat uns kurz nach der pause zwar einen d mpfer gegeben aber danach sind wir wieder gut ins spiel gekommen
8444615 in der phase m ssen wir ein tor machen ich selbst habe eine gro e chance die muss ich nutzen
8444616 wir sind erst wach geworden als es schon zu sp t war
8444617 aber wir sind nicht vor das tor von atletico gekommen wir hatten uns mehr vorgenommen sind aber nicht an unsere leistungsgrenze gekommen das war zu wenig
8444618 wir sind mit einer 1 0 f hrung in das spiel gegangen haben diesen vorteil aber nicht genutzt daf r wurden wir bitter bestraft
8444619 even if it is passed today we still need to wait for the senate to pass the bill which will only happen in december it is clear this is a ploy to ensure anwar will not take part in the debate
8444620 this is the first time im hearing this why should we worry a person is just a person
8444621 it is up to the mps whether they want the session to be extended i dont know
8444622 he should have done this immediately after i had finished tabling the bill not after so many members had debated it

8444627 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8444628 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8444629 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8444630 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8444631 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8444632 i believe that caracas will become a first world city in 20 years i have a very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally which i will be calling on to assist in this

8444636 ive always felt more much comfortable you know on the outside lobbing musical molotov cocktails over the barbed wire fence and you know i believe that both political parties are severely flawed and neither one of them really represents the true needs of the vast majority of americans
8444637 but theres clearly differences as well and it can definitely mean life or death to tens of thousands if not more people whos elected this next election
8444638 half of the people in the arena clueless on the war issue
8444639 about 8 000 free tickets were handed out by lottery for the show sponsored by tent state university and iraq veterans against the war

8444658 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8444659 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8444660 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8444661 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8444662 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8444663 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand

8444666 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8444667 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8444668 we did not match up well with them at all
8444669 we were not able to score enough goals to win until alex took over in goal
8444670 everybody seems to have a good goalie no matter who you play
8444671 we will be very well balanced there will not be a lot of difference between our first and third lines
8444672 stoa will be a good captain i hope this year will be a lot like 2005 we are fired up for the season
8444673 the application was made by eusoff on grounds that i had paid for and brought eye expert dr albert edwards from the mayo clinic united states to treat mahadev
8444674 he could have been called as a witness in the inquiry
8444675 shim was unhappy and dissatisfied with the rejection of chew shim in a dec 14 2001 letter decided to appeal the rejection
8444676 it is obvious that shim had concealed these crucial facts and did not disclose them at the commencement of the inquiry
8444677 we are proud to be drawn with thailand last time around we were third this time we aspire to do better
8444678 the national team will be going to slovakia sept 13 25 and later play in the merdeka tournament oct 15 25th as part of their preparations
8444679 the national team have ample time to prepare and fam will provide all the required support in order for them to do well
8444680 it is important that we do better then the previous edition we will be working closely with the national team management to achieve that
8444681 we have won the cup three times and we surely want to do it once again
8444682 we have recalled our foreign based players for training and we hope under the guidance of new manager peter reid thailand will do well again
8444683 you broke the bonds and you loosed the chains carried the cross of my shame you know i believe it but i still havent found what im looking for
8444684 danny is a very strong player well suited for the russian leagues style
8444685 you will see him against manchester i believe he will seriously strengthen us
8444686 our domestic calendar was really busy but we have had time to prepare for the match in monaco
8444687 arshavins transfer story is taking too long it has already lasted six weeks and i wont deny it has had a negative impact on our team and our results as well
8444688 i hope we will all be able to play in good style against manchester and achieve positive result
8444689 it will be an unforgettable match not only for me but for all of us
8444690 i want to win i remember the last time we went there i only played half a team because we had a monday league game against newcastle
8444691 thaksin is happy to sell off a chunk but wants to retain the majority
8444692 but they potential investors want all of it everybody wants all of it they all want a football club
8444693 i have had representatives of companies from dubai saudi arabia and kuwait on to me
8444694 some of them have phoned the supporters club because they couldnt find the club number so i get the supporters club asking me if the club is for sale so ive got to deal with all that
8444695 we tell them that the club isnt for sale we are looking for new investment
8444696 it might not be the selling of a stake and weve got five or six options
8444697 they are like cowboys who feel they can do anything as and when they please
8444698 the state assembly is not a place for people to shout and misbehave there are proper channels for us to air and resolve our grievances without resorting to such behaviour
8444699 the speaker should allow us to take turns between the bn and opposition in raising questions he cannot give preference to the bn representatives alone
8444700 if they opposition had been victimised in any way then it would be fair for them to walk out
8444701 in this case the speaker did what was best for the proceedings and the opposition should have waited for the assembly to end and later raise the issue to the committee
8444702 their boycott has unduly disrupted the proceedings and i am afraid it will create a precedent
8444703 just because there are 15 of them does not mean they have a right to do as they please what are they really trying to prove
8444704 it was not the first painful clash with a hurdle in my career
8444705 but to trip at the ninth hurdle in the olympic final broke my heart rather than any bones

8444709 meanwhile we are helping to raise rm100 000 needed for jia xins treatment
8444710 her family cannot afford the expensive treatment as her father woon kim leong 37 is a welder and her mother is a clerk
8444711 we sent a memorandum to the speaker datuk razak mansor asking him why our questions had been put at the end of the order paper and that we be allowed to raise our supplementary questions in turn with the bn assemblymen
8444712 however at the assembly yesterday it was evident that our requests had fallen on deaf ears
8444713 we personally handed him the speaker our memorandum and were hopeful that there would be some kind of follow up action
8444714 we just want equal treatment in the assembly there are many issues which we need to highlight too
8444715 it is clear that the speaker is biased and has no courage to make a decision on the matter

8444720 what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8444721 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english

8444766 i thought we ran to the ball still not as well as we need to but better than we have in the past we had some assignment errors but we did it full speed but the one thing that did shine was our tackling i thought middle linebacker jerry franklin had an exceptional day tackling and free safety elton ford is going to be a wonderful player we are going to have growing pains with him but he sees things and he breaks well hes another guy who stood out that day
8444767 our experience is up front but we have all new starters at linebacker and all new starters in the secondary
8444768 thats kind of scary going into the first game you arent so much scared but aware of what your opponent can bring to the table thats a fine football team were playing on saturday
8444769 according to the newspaper clippings hes one of the top five at his position
8444770 and when you watch him on film this one personnel group we saw you would draft that kid off that one clip the guy is an outstanding football player he runs with his pads down and a forward lean very few times can the first guy tackle him and he doesnt fumble the football they had 11 turnovers last year thats it for the whole season and hes not only a fine football player carrying the ball but hes an exceptional receiver and sets up their screens very well
8444771 i cant wait to feel the crowd and see what this place is all about
8444772 i mean shoot were taking a young football team on the field were going to sit down there and get after peoples butts there is an excitement obviously it builds and builds and its one of the few times in a long time that i feel an emotion about me about the game of football once again

8444816 there wasnt any particular thing that sparked my interest in drums it was always there as if god gave me the talent and urge to play drums
8444817 he begged me to buy him a drum kit when he was two most music schools were reluctant to teach him at such a young age fortunately we found two teachers who successfully coached him
8444818 after his grade 2 examination we rewarded him with his own tama drum kit the same brand played by his idol kenny aronoff a studio musician who played with the rolling stones bob dylan and the smashing pumpkins
8444819 i would love to have him win a music scholarship to study overseas we are prepared to make sacrifices and travel with him for competitions

8444828 appreciation of art and beautiful things are very important in life i cant imagine going into ones house without art or beautiful things
8444829 when you travel a lot you see a lot of things in some countries the people do not have water and there are different classes with their different levels of living if you see these things for yourself then your eyes are opened to the reality of the world
8444830 i know the quality i want in my watches i have the right team i see my role as that of a music conductor i can play it many different ways the conductor determines the quality of the music as he orchestrates the musicians into producing beautiful music in the end the product must look good

8444832 i have been gardening for more than 20 years now i am very much into growing vegetables and other greens it makes sense to have the basics that i use in the kitchen you know the ingredients that i often use in cooking and in food preparation

8444865 however we hope to publish a healthy weight strategy shortly which will include measures like improving public transport because people on shetland are more likely to take the car because the distances are too far to walk and the inclement weather
8444866 one thing i have asked from the lord that i shall seek that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to meditate in his temple

8444873 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him

8444875 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8444876 these kinds of trials are very biased its difficult for someone to be absolved
8444877 a lawyer can do very little because theres no evidence of criminal activity presented only what the police say
8444878 weve finished our new album we dont know if this is because of that or if it could be something thats been cooking for months

8444886 a device that measures cancer specific gases in exhaled breath would change medical research as we know it
8444887 its been wonderful in that last week to see more students here
8444888 my understanding is that the diocese has always intended the high school to go to this model but certainly changes in leadership facilitated that
8444889 the real value of having a president is that it makes a principal more available for students teachers and parents
8444890 there are a lot of people out there who need help
8444891 people come in with no shoes not shirt and give right off the beach
8444892 people dont realize how close on the edge we are

8444902 for 16 days i didnt know what was happening in the world
8444903 could have been a great opportunity to show improvements in human rights and make a better international image for china
8444904 but instead the government stressed security and the old set of control methods such as mobilizing the whole people
8444905 people who want to express their opinions or defend their rights will keep using the few channels they have
8444906 i still dont know when i can next see hu jia in jail i can only keep fighting for it as early as possible
8444907 she could be taken away at any time we will sue the re education through labor committee we cannot protest but we will use other means
8444908 the authorities are too strict is there any principle behind this we will keep fighting
8444909 will continue to pursue comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system
8444910 i had no hope that the olympics would hasten political reform
8444911 look at what happened not a single protest was approved in the three protest parks and while foreign news media had greater freedom than before there was strict control on what the chinese media could write
8444912 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech freedom of religion while the world was watching
8444913 setting up protest areas still represents progress the ordinary people want to express their opinions and the authorities must gradually improve this
8444914 but it needs concrete implementation measures or otherwise its just an empty slogan
8444915 there will be limited experiments like more competition in the official local elections
8444916 we cannot import a political system from anywhere else and expect it to work
8444917 we need more time to understand the western political systems and decide what is best for chinas path of development
8444918 the west does not understand china we need more face to face exchange like the olympics
8444919 once again the presidential nominee has killed any reform of the primary process
8444920 will give some relief to the american people who appear tired of having the campaign go so early
8444921 those who would prefer to go later can go later
8444922 we could nominate a candidate in what amounts to a fluke situation
8444923 based on many phone calls with many of you in this room many of you have felt pressures
8444924 and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8444925 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8444926 the important thing to me is that we solve the problem and stop bickering about it
8444927 as pro life democrats we differ on the legality of abortion in roe v wade but as a democratic organization were looking for ways to work within our party and find a common ground
8444928 we believe that weve found the common ground on this
8444929 ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
8444930 offers an opportunity to put an end to this self destructive cycle of safe legal and rare otherwise known as regret depression and self denigration
8444931 once again the presidential nominee has killed any reform of the primary process
8444932 will give some relief to the american people who appear tired of having the campaign go so early
8444933 those who would prefer to go later can go later
8444934 based on many phone calls with many of you in this room many of you have felt pressures
8444935 president obama and vice president biden will shut down guantanamo respect the constitution and make clear once and for all the united states of america does not torture not now not ever

8444939 geoeyes amazing imagery combined with the intense aerial combat experience in h a w x makes this a perfect partnership for everyone especially gamers
8444940 this notion of if i can just be still enough to listen to you just in that process of listening creates understanding
8444941 this year im in kuala lumpur for two months there are so many talented musicians and im honoured to work with them lewis pragasam michael veerapen jose thomas and zailan razak to name a few
8444942 ive performed in bangkok vietnam singapore hong kong taipei and shanghai staying as long as four months but ive found that in kuala lumpur there are musicians of similar calibre to those in the united states
8444943 i performed with wynton in singapore about five years ago hes one of my all time favourites
8444944 shes a stellar entertainer who is always in her element on stage or in person
8444945 oben meiner bescheidenen meinung nach sollte ein staatsrat b rgermeister senator oder b rgerschaftsabgeordneter genau einer sache loyal sein politik
8444946 i am sure i will be totally a hundred percent criticized
8444947 but im criticized anyways regardless whether its making music or acting theres always people who love what people do and theres always detractors and i think you just have to get to the point where you stop caring what other people think i know that summer is the same that we judge our own performances pretty stridently and were harsh on ourselves i think thats how you have to live life is listening to yourself and listening to your own judgments and try to self regulate it and just try and keep doing a good job
8444948 she is really successful has a singular purpose and she kicks ass in her own way she gets what she wants
8444949 you know shes the ceo of a corporation that develops technology
8444950 as a musician were dealing with technology all the time nowadays so its not such a stretch
8444951 and really sweet and really being very friendly and made me feel really welcome the whole cast has actually which really means a lot when your coming into something like this
8444952 every script is better then i thought it could be
8444953 it was a big deal for me though because i had been waiting for this executive producers josh friedman and james middleton didnt give anything away in the beginning so i had to create my own decisions about where cameron came from and who she was and its the most difficult acting ive ever done its very very demanding and i wanted to do my best because many people dont get a script like that especially in tv its just a really special script and its my favorite definitely my favorite
8444954 i dont want to give too much away but its very dangerous and very scary for john because he needs to be able to trust cameron with his life and he needs to feel he knows where shes going to be all the time and shes struggling to try and pull it back together
8444955 and he kind of turns his back on cameron so shes lost her purpose in life because hes being very rebellious this season so cameron is left to try and pick up the pieces
8444956 i think everybody was like its going to be me
8444957 i dont believe it i think we are all going to be around
8444958 attempting to censor free speech and creating a pathology of oppression that threatens to gut the first amendment
8444959 mr obama has now established an undeniable indelible image of himself as a thin skinned pathological authoritarian
8444960 time and again since he first declared himself a candidate for the presidency he has first denied charges against him and then when the truth came out viciously attacked those who dared to tell the truth he has shown utter contempt both for the facts of the matter and freedom of speech
8444961 call into question his fitness to hold any position where he can suppress dissent and oppress those who dare to offer it
8444962 my job is to make the decisions about the national security issues their job is just to get the job done
8444963 we have obama is once again exhibiting the same chilling cycle of defraud and defame obama knows he has maintained a close friendship with ayers and he knows that ayers remains proud of his terrorist attacks upon the people of the united states so instead of admitting his own frightening lack of good judgment obama once again viciously attacks those who dare to expose the truth
8444964 they were launching him introducing him to the hyde park community as the best thing since sliced bread

8444973 i believe in an america that gives every child the opportunity to fulfill his or her potential
8444974 i believe in an america that paves a broad road for families to thrive
8444975 oregon needs a senator who will fight for affordable health care living wage jobs an end to the war and a smart energy policy not a senator who will give us more of failed policies
8444976 i believe in an america that gives every child the opportunity to fulfill his or her potential
8444977 i believe in an america that paves a broad road for families to thrive
8444978 oregon needs a senator who will fight for affordable health care living wage jobs an end to the war and a smart energy policy not a senator who will give us more of failed policies
8444979 my opponent talks like barack obama but he votes like george bush
8444980 as the national economy slows vermonters are struggling to keep pace with rising fuel and food prices
8444981 i really believe that during the next couple years i can continue to make a difference to assure hope and opportunity and prosperity for the families of vermont
8444982 thats not what it takes to run and win a statewide campaign
8444983 its clear from these reports that theres one viable opponent to jim douglas and thats gaye symington
8444984 i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal
8444985 but in that certain moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle
8444986 the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain i couldnt make another step
8444987 finally i recovered and could go back to the locker room and take a shower
8444988 i feel like i have made it here i really can do it and i have done it here
8444989 i played a good first round im surprised because my confidence is not so great at the start of tournaments
8444990 but i played good all three sets fighting good and with very good concentration
8444991 i have been tired all year but im a player at a big event

8445019 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8445020 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8445021 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8445022 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8445023 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8445024 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8445025 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8445026 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8445033 recently gilchrist has claimed that his defamation suit is only in abeyance and he can bring it back the courts ruling today puts the lie to gilchrists wishful thinking
8445034 sicuramente dovremo capire che cosa venuto a mancare che cosa c da cambiare perch certamente anomalo un calo improvviso di questo tipo dopo una regular season dominata
8445035 bisogna capire se il rendimento mostrato nei playoff il nostro reale valore e pertanto prima la squadra si era espressa al di sopra delle proprie possibilit oppure se la nostra dimensione quella che per mesi abbiamo fatto vedere e che poi non siamo riusciti a mantenere occorrer riflettere a mente fredda con valutazioni profonde sul calo di rendimento che si verificato e trovarne i motivi faremo delle analisi dettagliate su ogni singolo giocatore
8445036 no marco nanni e i suoi collaboratori saranno riconfermati dipende ovviamente anche da loro proseguire o meno ma per quanto riguarda la societ c la massima fiducia in loro
8445037 austin un giocatore della fortitudo e pertanto non giocher in nessunaltra squadra italiana o rimarr con noi oppure star negli stati uniti
8445038 potrebbe anche accadere di trovarsi a disputare un campionato rinunciando ai giocatori stranieri oppure ingaggiarne uno soltanto il lanciatore pu anche succedere di dover mettere degli under 21 in prima squadra se non hai il budget per fare un campionato competitivo
8445039 queste ovviamente sono soltanto ipotesi pensando a situazioni che spero proprio non si verificheranno adesso ancor presto per parlare di quale sar il futuro della fortitudo dobbiamo ancora chiudere il bilancio 2008 dobbiamo verificare quello che potrebbe essere il budget per il 2009 per chi vuole investire nella fortitudo baseball le porte della nostra societ sono aperte
8445040 io non nascondo che il nostro obiettivo alla vigilia del campionato era un piazzamento dentro le prime quattro posizioni della regular season
8445041 ad un posto nei playoff abbiamo sempre creduto racconta antolini personaggio di grande equilibrio e competenza capace di trasmettere serenit allambiente ci abbiamo sempre creduto noi dirigenti ci hanno sempre creduto i giocatori conoscevamo le nostre possibilit sul mercato avevamo agito con lintento di dare pi sostanza e dunque pi tranquillit al monte di lancio la prima fase di stagione servita per capire come si doveva andare per sperimentare e verificare nella seconda parte con un assetto preciso e collaudato la squadra cresciuta sul piano della continuit di rendimento e ha effettivamente prodotto quel baseball che pensavamo sapesse fare
8445042 le tattiche sono tattiche siamo stati criticati per la strategia dei 3 lanciatori stranieri scegliendo di giocare al di fuori del monte di lancio soltanto con vasquez e matamoros ma una scelta che fa parte di una programmazione avremmo voluto cominciare questa strategia lanno scorso quando gi avevamo puntato gli occhi su tiago da silva lui allora era ancora straniero ma a noi non importava lavremmo tesserato comunque e utilizzato come terzo pitcher straniero poi non siamo riusciti ad averlo e arrivato questanno e prima dellinizio del campionato arrivata anche la cittadinanza italiana per matrimonio tiago un ragazzo giovanissimo un autentico talento viene da tre campionati di a2 dove ha giocato bene da interbase e si dimostrato anche efficace battitore per lui si sempre sentito un lanciatore in virt anche del suo status da oriundo fin dallinizio della stagione lo abbiamo messo sul monte nella partita dei lanciatori non asi dapprima per pochi inning come rilievo poi strada facendo cresciuto sempre pi fino a diventare titolare fino a tenere il monte anche per 8 inning questo ventitreenne italobrasiliano non aveva mai giocato in a1 non aveva mai giocato lanciatore a questi livelli lunica sua esperienza da pitcher era stata da giovanissimo un anno a taiwan si rivelato fra i migliori lanciatori della regular season con 1 92 di media pgl e ha fatto buone cose anche nei playoff con 2 51 di pgl nel round robin
8445043 quando si infortunato juan figueroa lo abbiamo sostituito con horacio estrada decidendo di rimanere cos anche quando sarebbe rientrato figueroa la scelta di avere tre lanciatori su cinque giocatori stranieri tesserabili qualcosa di innovativo per il baseball italiano e una scelta che adesso nella fase pi importante della stagione sta pagando
8445044 il 15 agosto scorso il san marino con i suoi lanciatori stranieri ha perso 8 4 qui allo steno borghese i nostri pitchers cruz e florian furono superiori ai loro
8445045 his contributors are saying we think the attorney generals opinion is wrong and we think it violates our federal civil rights
8445046 if the law is challenged the attorney generals office will defend the law
8445047 as a tax payer and resident of vermont i do think this issue should be resolved and the law should be clear so that anyone who is running for any office clearly knows they are operating within the confines of the system
8445048 there should be a level playing field im happy that people are pursuing this
8445049 thats not what it takes to run and win a statewide campaign
8445050 its clear from these reports that theres one viable opponent to jim douglas and thats gaye symington
8445051 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8445052 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8445053 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8445054 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8445055 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8445056 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8445057 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8445058 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8445059 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8445060 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics

8445088 whether a business is being carried on is a question of fact and objective consideration of the extent of the applicants activities relating to the property
8445089 these activities have all the hallmarks of maintaining and deriving income from an investment rather than the carrying on of a business
8445090 the activities such as financing the property dealing with the rating authorities and body corporate are no more than any investor in real estate would do equally the maintenance of accounting and tax records are relevant to any income producing investment
8445091 the consequence of the foregoing is that the objection decision under review should be affirmed on the basis that the holiday unit was not an active asset as it was not used or held ready for use in the course of carrying on a business

8445135 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8445136 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8445137 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life

8445144 econ 100 this is finance not macro or even micro economics
8445145 current fed policy is consistent with an easing in overall inflation given the dynamics of the economy
8445146 i am mindful of todays elevated risks and am prepared at any point to change tactics to ensure inflation expectations do not become unanchored
8445147 monetary policy at the moment is roughly where it should be and i think the discussion about declining rates in europe is premature if the economic outlook brightens somewhat again towards the end of the year and next year which i still expect well have to see if action is necessary
8445148 i dont expect inflation to come down necessarily just with weaker growth inflation is still the no 1 worry for central bankers in the euro region

8445167 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8445168 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8445169 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8445206 if you are ignorant and you dont know when life begins then you go on the side of safety and protecting rights
8445207 if i dont know then ill protect all the more i dont want to act while im ignorant

8445209 higher and rising inflation is having an effect on pay negotiations in the private sector but pressure on profits is also a key part of the picture as the economic outlook worsens
8445210 these contradictory pressures will be foremost in the minds of decision makers as they plan ahead for 2009 pay reviews
8445211 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8445212 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8445213 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8445214 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8445215 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8445216 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8445217 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8445218 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8445219 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8445220 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8445221 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8445222 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8445223 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8445224 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8445225 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8445226 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8445227 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8445228 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8445229 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8445230 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8445231 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8445232 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8445233 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8445234 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8445235 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8445236 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8445237 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8445238 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8445239 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8445240 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8445241 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8445242 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8445243 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8445244 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8445245 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8445246 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8445247 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8445248 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8445249 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8445250 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8445251 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8445252 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8445253 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8445254 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8445255 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8445256 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8445257 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8445258 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8445259 you might do something stupid get yourself killed id like that
8445260 two shots to the head if you ask me it couldnt have happened to a nicer guy
8445261 most startups give away so much for free that users have no reason to upgrade
8445262 there had even been an internal memo about the railings
8445263 you are my lord i have no good apart from you
8445264 the lord is my chosen portion and my cup you hold my lot the lines have fallen for me in pleasant places indeed i have a beautiful inheritance
8445265 for you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear but you received the spirit of sonship
8445266 there are a lot of boring heiresses out there there is no sin worse than being boring
8445267 that night the lord appeared to him and said i am the god of your father abraham
8445268 have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be terrified do not be discouraged for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go
8445269 i will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you i will curse and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you
8445270 i will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed because you have obeyed me
8445271 but as for you the lord took you and brought you out of the iron smelting furnace out of egypt to be the people of his inheritance as you now are
8445272 after this i looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count from every nation tribe people and language standing before the throne and in front of the lamb they were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands
8445273 the lord said to moses the land is to be allotted to them as an inheritance based on the number of names
8445274 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
8445275 being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience and joyfully giving thanks to the father who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light
8445276 the lord is my portion i promise to keep your words
8445277 whom have i in heaven but you and there is nothing on earth that i desire besides you my flesh and my heart may fail but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever
8445278 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints
8445279 all the patients here lead normal lives they dress normally they go about on the streets only they do it all lying down
8445280 the patients lay on their stretcherbeds two at a table it might have resembled a banquet from antiquity if the drained pallid faces of the worst sufferers hadnt shattered any illusions
8445281 she was an animal every bit as splendid as his horse which he adored more than anything
8445282 when someone is all of a sudden removed from life and has the time and the necessary calm to ask himself a single essential question regarding it one single question he is poisoned forever
8445283 this is his legacy both hillary clinton as a plausible candidate for president and barack obama
8445284 i think he and obama have talked more in the last week than theyve probably talked all their lives
8445285 when you have things like this it gets pretty wild theres a healing process my sense is the healing process is accelerating
8445286 this is going to be a much warmer thing than you had with ronald reagan and gerald ford its going to be a much warmer thing than you had with edward kennedy and jimmy carter bill clinton and al gore
8445287 there are a lot of positive things that are happening
8445288 i dont think hes publicly come to grips with the political realities
8445289 its my hope and prayer that over the next few days the campaigns reconcile
8445290 this is his legacy both hillary clinton as a plausible candidate for president and barack obama
8445291 i think he and obama have talked more in the last week than theyve probably talked all their lives
8445292 when you have things like this it gets pretty wild theres a healing process my sense is the healing process is accelerating
8445293 this is going to be a much warmer thing than you had with ronald reagan and gerald ford its going to be a much warmer thing than you had with edward kennedy and jimmy carter bill clinton and al gore
8445294 there are a lot of positive things that are happening
8445295 i dont think hes publicly come to grips with the political realities
8445296 its my hope and prayer that over the next few days the campaigns reconcile
8445297 we were able to flip the cell from one state into another
8445298 any case where theres a cell type missing and there are neighboring cells that are still healthy
8445299 you wouldnt be transplanting cells so you wouldnt be dealing with immune issues
8445300 we just asked sort of like an undergraduate the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning
8445301 i wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells
8445302 a young woman had died in his office and that she had a complicated medical history specifically surrounding stroke and epilepsy
8445303 swings his little club with about as much discrimination as bamm bamm the diaper clad pugilist on the flintstones
8445304 its not really the media so much as it is sort of this political class of people who just go around causing trouble all the time
8445305 for instance it is spread all over the internet right now that my staff member lori klausutis who died tragically a month ago was killed by me i could list a thousand conspiracy theories against me that i rig elections that i have a drug running outfit with the cia that im a murderer that i have 15 illegitimate children
8445306 there is an old saying that warns that if you allow people to assume the worst they will so be it
8445307 dont be afraid to be funny because you are funny i asked you why you arent in congress you said that you had sex with the intern and then you had to kill her
8445308 take the train to pennant hills station on the hornsby via strathfield line cross over railway line and join glenorie bus routes 651 to 655 the bus takes about 10 minutes to koala park
8445309 plus i have to think about the budget as well i dont exactly have unlimited funds
8445310 i would but based on my sched i only have a week or slightly more than a week to spare
8445311 these projects are our way of saying thank you to the people of denver our gracious hosts this week but our work today is also out of support and great admiration for the troops who are serving our country abroad and keeping us safe at home my family is thrilled to be here today to send a few comforts of home to our soldiers overseas
8445312 we hope the more than one thousand delegates taking part in the many service projects across denver today will carry that commitment to service back to help their communities long after our convention is over
8445313 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster
8445314 but i want to emphasize that our citizens have a personal responsibility
8445315 see my telepathic powers are alive and well i predicted this feature several years in advance
8445316 we strongly advise against all travel to high density low income suburban areas at any time and all but essential travel to rural mashonaland rural manicaland and farming areas there have been a number of serious incidents in rural areas and it is dangerous for farmers or agricultural workers to visit former properties or other agricultural areas you should also avoid areas where war veterans are active the situation remains unpredictable and incidents of violence across the country continue it could deteriorate further without warning
8445317 murders and rapes bring a bad name to goa and the home department should take care of this even the much maligned tourist police are not under the control of tourism department
8445318 while our legislators have complained of beggars hawkers and lamanis harassing tourists on goan beaches the home department should tighten its control over the functioning of the tourist police
8445319 tourists do not fly to the beaches they drive on the roads and these should also be cleaned
8445320 but vested interests created confusion in order to cause delays in the issuance of shack licenses last year in the following tourist season shack licences will be alloted by the end of september
8445321 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8445322 merewm uff que complicado poner adsense en mi youtube pvponline do you use feedburner to syndicate your feed
8445323 obama won the nom cause he was more feminine than hrc how often did i say

8445326 a concept vehicle that showcases innovative bmw activehybrid technology in the worlds first sports activity coup on the road the bmw x6 concept activehybrid is as agile and enjoyable as it is efficient leaving conventional hybrids far behind in the driving pleasure stakes
8445327 this next generation xj could also be the first jaguar car ever to be offered with a hybrid engine option to go along with an entry level v 6 mill several v 8s as well as diesel choices
8445328 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8445329 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8445330 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8445331 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8445332 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8445333 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8445334 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8445335 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8445336 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8445337 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8445338 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8445339 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8445340 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8445341 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8445342 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8445343 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8445344 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8445345 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8445346 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8445347 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8445348 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8445349 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8445350 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8445351 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8445352 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8445353 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8445354 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8445355 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8445356 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8445357 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8445358 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8445359 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8445360 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8445361 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8445362 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8445363 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8445364 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8445365 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8445366 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8445367 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8445368 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8445369 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8445370 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8445371 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8445372 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8445373 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8445374 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8445375 this is a game that will deliver a rich fast paced and intense grand theft auto experience that will be truly unique to nintendos handheld platform
8445376 die deutsche kriegsmarine bereitet sich auf ihren ersten kampfeinsatz zur piratenjagd vor noch in diesem jahr wird die eu eine flottille vor die k ste somalias entsenden um dort gegen die kaperung westlicher handelsschiffe einzuschreiten best tigt der verteidigungsminister weil der einsatz im eu rahmen erfolge k nne man ber bestimmungen des grundgesetzes hinwegsehen und soldaten zur verbrechensbek mpfung einsetzen behauptet berlin einen baldigen marineeinsatz zur piratenjagd fordern besonders deutsche reeder denen durch kaperungen wachsende verluste entstehen darunter der chef der bremer reederei beluga
8445377 the rays are the talk of the whole country not just here
8445378 a lot of the talk is will they hold on
8445379 and just watching the nucleus of the club everybody goes through the challenges and injuries and all sorts of things but i think theyre for real theyre gonna be there at the end theyre a great story a great young team
8445380 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8445381 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8445382 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8445383 i dont think this would be much different than a weather delay in another city
8445384 if our politics were even vaguely functional anything that the three of us would have agreed on would have happened long ago
8445385 as boone says this is not rocket science this is pretty simple auto mechanics
8445386 so lets understand we have some deep profound political problems that make us need to have this conversation
8445387 everyone was riding so well especially robbie walker from australia he front boarded through that kink middle rail thats such a gnarly kink
8445388 the level of riding was ridiculous i was trying as hard as i could not to look ridiculous riding with those guys those two are the best two riders around at the moment
8445389 it was fun but cold tonight and it was a crazy level of riding
8445390 i feel like ive been run over by a semi
8445391 the technology made available by kirtas will allow us to reveal the treasures of mcgill library to the world and enable sophisticated means of resource discovery
8445392 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8445393 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8445394 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8445395 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8445396 this has been the most devastating fire weve seen in recent memory
8445397 looks like weve got to do school shopping all over again
8445398 scrawled out on a bar napkin after the fifth cranappletini
8445399 ive been researching the trip and i am familiar with most aspects including the darien gap but i have two specific questions
8445400 its not the first virus weve seen on the station
8445401 constituent service is one of my top priorities i hope that you will let my staff and i assist you in your dealings with federal agencies
8445402 the size and scope of the federal government can sometimes be overwhelming but we are here to make sure that the bureaucracy is accountable to you
8445403 the concerns we have with this contract are the unknown costs and the unintended consequences to our local economy and the unknown costs for medications and medical that we would have to provide its just a bad business contract its written to the advantage of the state
8445404 weve made some significant progress attracting jobs and investment attracting jobs to sedalia and pettis county over the past few years
8445405 we were encouraged to really weigh that very carefully by economic folks and city leaders according to the experts it would definitely have a negative impact
8445406 entering a crucial period for attracting business to the downtown district
8445407 the direction the commission has taken since the beginning when the proposal was submitted to them has leaned in that direction
8445408 there was an amount of what the increase was going to be and those were factored in to the cost of housing these inmates
8445409 certainly the term sex offender those are charged words that raise public opinion and there is no question there has been a lot of public opinion expressed during this process
8445410 now its even harder to get a modification than it was five months ago
8445411 ein geschichtenerz hler der menschen und gegenst nde genau wie ereignisse mit ins extrem getriebener kindlicher naivit t betrachtet wie zuf llig entdeckt er im allt glichen das phantastische mit seiner grotesken weltsicht gelingt es ihm immer wieder die wirklichkeit auszutricksen
8445412 hats off to the mayor for sticking it to these english first clowns
8445413 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married
8445414 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8445415 he was a talented and spirited student who continued to follow his passion for drama after leaving the college
8445416 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
8445417 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8445418 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8445419 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8445420 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8445421 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8445422 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8445423 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8445424 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8445425 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8445426 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8445427 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8445428 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8445429 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8445430 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8445431 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8445432 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8445433 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8445434 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8445435 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8445436 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8445437 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8445438 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8445439 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8445440 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8445441 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8445442 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8445443 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8445444 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8445445 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office

8445458 las diferencias en las remuneraciones en trabajos de igual valor basadas en criterios distintos de las caracter sticas y naturaleza del trabajo que se realiza

8445464 alat yang saya paparkan adalah alat yang mengukur kecepatan angin dengan menggunakan air
8445465 pada awalnya saya menciptakan alat ini karena terinspirasi pada adik saya yang bermain baling baling di situlah saya membuat suatu percobaan dan mengusulkan kepada guru saya ely red untuk mengikuti tes uji karya tulis ilmiah beberapa bulan yang lalu
8445466 karena alatnya sederhana masyarakat juga bisa memanfaatkan alat ini untuk mengunakannya dengan tujuan melihat kekuatan angin tanpa menunggu penelitian dari badan meteorologi dan geofisika bmg

8445565 the question is is the hospital acting as an immigration agent in effect by deporting this patient
8445566 its important to make sure that hospitals arent permitted to dump patients on an international level when they cant do it on a local level
8445567 hospitals dont have the financial resources to meet all of the acute care needs of patients without insurance let alone take on all the chronic care needs that present with patients like this

8445575 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8445576 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8445626 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
8445627 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off
8445628 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
8445629 my understanding is their interpretation of scripture is that to immunize would be to show a lack of faith in gods ability to protect them and therefore they choose not to do that

8445639 sevens director of programming and production tim worner said mark was such a brilliant artist his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8445640 marks first big tv break was when he appeared in the
8445641 she gave him a key role in her mini series
8445642 mark also has some notable theatre credits he worked with the famed bell shakespeare company where he played silvio in
8445643 born in perth he has always wanted to act and from a young age entertained his school friends with his classroom gags mark moved to sydney in 1997 to study at nida and appeared in many student productions before graduating in 1999

8445653 i think the conservatives are facing enough risks in this campaign because basically harpers putting his government on the line with no guarantee of success
8445654 a wild card thats not likely to play in his favour
8445655 there is no valid argument that theres been any cuts whatsoever to the canadian food inspection agency
8445656 whats occurred could lead to a broader discussion on governments role in these kind of things and its pretty clear that the harper government has more of a laissez faire self regulatory view on a lot of these issues
8445657 so it could leave the conservatives vulnerable if a narrative emerges that this is an example of what happens when you dont have actual government inspectors and you cant rely on an industry to police itself
8445658 this issue goes to the heart of what stephen harper is all about
8445659 hes a prime minister in charge of governing who doesnt believe in government
8445660 theyve moved to a paper system whereby industry basically regulates itself so the big loss in terms of front line inspection happened long before the conservatives came on board the conservatives are simply doing another round in the same direction

8445934 the public are entitled to know why she withheld this crucial information for so long
8445935 anyone who says obama is a muslim doesnt know what they are talking about anyone who says obama is not a muslim doesnt know what they are talking about however anyone who says obama attended and supported an america hating church for 20 years has spent just 145 days in the senate and is a far left loon with a socialist agenda is right on
8445936 the events give rise to the likelihood of a need for a further impairment in the carrying value of dorchesters investment in st laurence
8445937 its tour going to be very draining and she needs him around to aid her in her recovery time after each show
8445938 if something were to happen or we wanted to do something he could catch today
8445939 we do need to pay attention to all that stuff
8445940 but i dont know if necessarily that is why the cramping happened
8445941 but its hard to piece it together behind the plate so id rather have an extra guy there for that

8445946 the rules are so in favor of the railroads in this instance
8445947 divide and conquer strategy i question if they are honest brokers
8445948 no one could orchestrate this this does come from their hearts
8445949 maybe im wrong but it doesnt sound like cn is even meeting with people i back right up to the tracks and i feel its going to kill business in barrington hopefully what will come out of this is that cn decides to work with the suburbs but my opinion is that they dont care
8445950 the purpose of the walk to me is that it shows something outside the controlled environment that cn has managed to arrange theyre trying to fine tune everything to make sure its as pretty as can be
8445951 theres a lot of energy to keep barrington the way it is
8445952 i hope that they see its important to stand up for things you believe in or in this case thing you dont believe in
8445953 nobody wants to impede progress but theyre leaving communities to bear the brunt of this

8445955 innovation ecosystem that system of loosely interrelating elements of which universities are a part that has enabled us to make new discoveries capture their value in the marketplace enhance productivity and thereby increase our standard of living where we once optimized our organizations around efficiency and quality today we must optimize our society around innovation
8445956 since universities are arguably are barely getting into the efficiency and quality bandwagons now how can we leap frog into the innovation agenda
8445957 university innovation will not occur in a vacuum it requires a close and deep collaboration between universities and industry and it requires a willingness to experiment with new models and new alliances
8445958 there are thousands of universities employing hundreds of thousands of people educating millions of students and spending billions of dollars all in the urban core and fringe
8445959 so they have special importance to the re making of the city and its future and they have special reason to want to be instrumental in shaping their citys future
8445960 a new version of the three rs to describe the activities of the new metropolitan university revitalization relevance and regionalism
8445961 our vision is to create a vibrant mixed use environment that blurs the boundaries between the university and the community is pedestrian friendly and in which everything that happens is somehow about learning and health and wellness
8445962 a basic infrastructure component and far more important than traditional infrastructures such as canals railroads and freeway systems of past epochs
8445963 engage in relentless innovation in education generally and higher education in particular we must do so because in todays knowledge based economy education is societys infrastructure education unleashes the power of innovation by creating the human capital the talent supply chain that shapes our industries and our society and i think that to meet the challenges of global competitiveness we must continually redefine the nature of our universities

8445967 i remember when i first started to run here i was the high tech guy from northern virginia spending enormous amounts of time in south side and southwest virginia
8445968 there was at first a suspicion hey is this guy the real deal or is it just the equivalent of a political drive by and i think with time people understood this is something im passionate about
8445969 somebody who has already been caricatured by the media so much and misrepresented
8445970 while sen obama may not close the deal with folks its not like sen mccain has either
8445971 if you think back to the clinton 92 campaign you may not have known all of the economic policies but you knew he was going to come out and focus on the economy you knew there were ideas about national service there were a couple of takeaways and i think this notion of driving down gas prices grappling with kids going to college the question of particularly in these communities how do you not have to move away to find a world class job is all the prosperity going to be in our major metropolitan areas i think hes gotta connect that
8445972 one of the things i talk about it trying to build a bipartisan group of radical centrists that could say no to both ends and people say ahhh warner youre crazy that cant happen it just wont happen i dont accept it
8445973 youre basically saying that if you accept that then short of a massive majority from one party or the other youre talking about continuing institutional gridlock and youre basically saying the senates going to be a failed institution thats not where i want to go work

8446000 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8446001 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he said
8446002 we expect margins to contract by 2 to 3 per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said
8446003 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix mr dunn said

8446007 my inexperience pieced holes into my ship like a porcupine in a plastic bag
8446008 in july of last year i was what one might call a struggling soon to be writer i wasnt much of a writer yet as i hadnt ever finished anything the only thing id ever done for non school purposes was a 3 page story about john cages song that was made up of only silence i still think its amazing that i wrote three pages about nothing i had never done anything large scale like writing a novel oh no that was left to the professionals i had a story to tell but had not roughed the seas of attemptive noveling yet i knew my boat of noveling would sink my inexperience pieced holes into my ship like a porcupine in a plastic bag however as i said it was july of last year when i became a soon to be writer i dreamed up this cliched beyond belief story and decided to see if i could write it so i started typing away in the story that i am slightly embarrassed to even mention now only a week after i started writing i found out about nanowrimo from my sister who knew a wrimo i checked it out and fell into the fascinating soul eating adventure that is called nano of all the wonderful things nano 07 gave me a whopping bucket of fun addicting forums cool people to meet and awesome pep talks my two favorite things would have to be 1 the confidence to just get out there and type for the fun of it and not because the story has to be readable and 2 an introduction to a character who is sure to follow me around for the rest of my life showing up at joes crab shack for a dance and meeting me at work yes those are some of the places i have seen him post nano 07 the confidence to write is perhaps the most important item in my doggy bag from nano but i figure everyone will say something just as cliched as i will so i wont attempt to talk too much about it i will only say that nano gave me the confidence and ability to move from being a struggling soon to be writer to an actual honest to goodness writer it was an amazing transition and my life will never be the same again now people can stare at me when i say im a writer like they did when i told them i was a musician i will enjoy the confidence boost quite a bit but i have to admit hanging out with jimmy my mmc from nano 07 is more fun than sitting on a log contemplating my confidence level i loved spending a month with jimmy in the crazy pursuit of a ridiculous robber who stole burritos at gunpoint let me tell you it was the most meaningful attempt at bounty hunting ive experienced yet i plan on running off with jimmy again sometime to do some more criminal hunting unfortunately i have to take his girlfriend with us bummer if she had a little more character development which im trying to edit into my nano right now then maybe i wouldnt be so annoyed at her tagging along i have to admit though when shes with jimmy they click so ill keep her for jimmys sake to sum up nano was tons of fun gave me a confidence that will only be shaken a little by a rejection letter and the knowledge of who to take with me when i go fishing or on some other rollicking romp through a day that needs livening up nano also taught me two things about characters 1 i learned to let a character be who he or she wants to be because s he will tell you how to fit her him into the story later 2 i learned to listen to the characters in my head and let them do what they want because they know the story better than i do even the little blobs of half characters sometimes know more than i do what do you know my boat of noveling was not actually punctured by my inexperience what i thought were holes actually turned out to be little blobby pieces of characters who wanted to go on great journeys with me yay cohorts for my future noveling adventures
8446009 every american who was trying to do the right thing
8446010 john mccain is my friend weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by john still amazes me
8446011 but i profoundly i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
8446012 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8446013 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8446014 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job

8446019 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario

8446027 we identified a real need for a secure and fast source of water in the event of a fire and saw the additional benefit to the community if a permanent water source was available
8446028 the council gave us a 2000 grant to kick start the project without which it would never have come to fruition
8446029 the tank storage and a stock trough will have far less wastage from evaporation and be easier to keep clean and fresh
8446030 thank you to the rlpb and also the harden rfs for their support and the supply of some of the stand pipe fittings
8446031 we really must thank john drum and all of the council for their initial support
8446032 it is great to see some of the local rates coming back into the small villages for something that will be a be a great benefit for years to come
8446033 in dry conditions water is so scarce that finding supplies in a fire event is a real issue
8446034 if any landowners have a water source suitable for a static water supply in a fire emergency could they please contact the harden fire control centre on 6386 3170
8446035 its our way of giving back to local farmers and truck drivers who have supported us and utilised our products over the years

8446037 i am involved in product development for passenger tyres and for many years have been proud to represent a brand i believe in

8446039 it was a very interesting story that in a town of 4 100 the museum attracts some 40 000 visitors a year
8446040 kenny confirmed that people are willing to travel and looking for things to do in their leisure time
8446041 the greatest proportion of these are retirees travelling with their caravans and this is only going to increase as the baby boomers move into retirement themselves
8446042 members of the chamber were discussing how it would be good for young to think about how we might get a year round tourist attraction
8446043 if we could get on their roadmap with an attraction to draw them to the town they would then spend time and money in the retail shops restaurants and motels
8446044 members of the young chamber of commerce have access to these services as reciprocal members of the larger organisation
8446045 there are now 130 chambers across nsw which gives us a strong lobbying voice for small business
8446046 we hope to build up the dinner introducing business and community awards next year as well
8446047 the chamber is going from strength to strength doubling in membership in the last six months
8446048 initially we started with 15 members 18 months ago and now are 68 strong
8446049 were delighted to have apples government organization as part of our team

8446054 it was a wonderful day and everyone including the prisoners had an enjoyable time
8446055 it takes a strong sense of humour to put yourself inside for this sort of event so the attitude and camaraderie of our inmates made for some entertaining banter
8446056 the fundraiser itself was very successful and a truly wonderful effort from everyone who took part

8446065 it is now and it probably always has been the case that hes the best speechwriter in the group
8446066 if anything the fact that officials recognized the concern about the dollars decline seems somewhat supportive for the dollar as maybe benign neglect was not so neglectful
8446067 at the end of the day however president bush is still set to be the first american president since at least the break up of bretton woods who has not authorized intervention in the fx market and given the recent price action the distinction looks relatively safe
8446068 the real malady is fear of life not of death
8446069 yes how did the man coming from the third world find the peace of mind to write stories fortunately art is generous and sympathetic in the same way that it dwells with the happy ones it does not desert the wretched it offers both alike the convenient means for expressing what swells up in their bosom
8446070 in spite of all what goes on around us i am committed to optimism until the end i do not say with kant that good will be victorious in the other world good is achieving victory every day it may even be that evil is weaker than we imagine in front of us is an indelible proof were it not for the fact that victory is always on the side of good hordes of wandering humans would not have been able in the face of beasts and insects natural disasters fear and egotism to grow and multiply they would not have been able to form nations to excel in creativeness and invention to conquer outer space and to declare human rights
8446071 what daily routine will create the most dramatic shift in this persons life

8446075 marcus wareing is emerging from ramsays shadow as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in london and he and his team should be congratulated
8446076 marcus would now appear to be well on the way to his stated intention of equalling the three michelin star rating ramsay currently holds at restaurant gordon ramsay
8446077 restaurant gordon ramsay has had a very good innings eight years at the top and still maintains very high standards
8446078 in the end though it is hardly surprising that an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8446079 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8446080 what you didnt hear is her acclaim for john mccain

8446087 i thought hillary had all the credentials to be the lady to lead america and it just didnt happen
8446088 i say it is about time it is finally going to happen where the average african american is seeing that the dream is becoming a reality
8446089 truthfully no not in my lifetime not in my lifetime

8446091 ahmadinejad is not complying with the will of the people
8446092 with inflation pressures increasing for small business owners this is not the best time to be forcing employers to pay workers higher wages every dollar a minimum wage worker gains must come out of either the income of the business owner so they have less to spend on their business or out of the pockets of customers who will have to pay higher prices e g inflation and will have less money to spend on other goods and services

8446101 i need to show that i can pitch up at this level and go seven innings

8446103 perkins had a good outing he just made a couple mistakes the one to ibanez that he left hanging there and then the one to lopez ended up in the seats as well other than that he threw the ball great gave us a great opportunity to win today

8446106 whilst i understand many bands can self release via digital shops that is not the plan
8446107 in fact we see digital as a far inferior format and the band would never plan to release an album exclusively in a digital format

8446114 in march the sbwma estimated that switching to single stream recycling would cost approximately 20 million
8446115 we didnt submit our own plan at the time because that seemed fairly reasonable but when their estimate grew to 41 5 million in april and finally to 53 9 million in june we became concerned we knew the job could be done for far less and we developed this 11 million plan
8446116 we dont understand why our alternative proposal wasnt considered given that it will save ratepayers millions of dollars
8446117 at the same time our organization has serious concerns regarding the rapidly escalating costs of the proposed construction to the shoreway facility particularly given the current economic climate with millions on the line for ratepayers its important that these decisions are made in the best interest of the residents and businesses of san mateo county

8446123 i know 44 years its a long time i think its going to be a challenge but ive never seen a campaign this early with as much energy and enthusiasm as theres been around senator obamas campaign so i think if senator obama can keep coming back to lynchburg come to roanoke come to southside come to southwest i think his chances are very good

8446190 its very much about getting back to what made it good in the first place thats what both those films have done in casino royale and batman begins they stripped it back down to the beginning and what appealed at the very conception what happens with things that exist for a long time is they become augmented and gimmicky and things change and they kind added to and added to to try and make them better and it ends up just toppling over under the weight of its own sort of self parody

8446257 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
8446258 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose

8446273 i believe that all consumers who have recently purchased a motor vehicle on credit should also get some form of government aid likewise all credit card debtors
8446274 those who over extended themselves should face the consequences and learn for the future i looked at six times salary loans and btl and thought mugs game so ive been renting and saving instead why should my taxes pay for the feckless few who didnt budget properly who naively belived the property porn pushers and bought at the top of the market at silly prices

8446276 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches

8446280 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8446288 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8446292 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8446293 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8446294 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8446295 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8446296 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

8446299 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8446300 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad

8446307 were sending a message that employers or labor contractors who fail to comply with californias heat regulations will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law fined in accordance with the law and face the reality of being shut down
8446308 it was a cracking cup tie but our performance was not that
8446309 volumes will remain thin and investors are likely to stayon the sidelines till a clearer picture emerges on thepolitical front
8446310 i think its based mostly on not knowing the laws and fear
8446311 i cant believe anybody would be working for less than minimum wage
8446312 i dont think its possible because of the competition between us trainers
8446313 they make way more than minimum wage you cant just take someone out of the grandstand and put him on a horse
8446314 i think this is a welcome opportunity for everyone to get it right
8446315 i think thats true for the trainers as well i dont think they should see this as a gotcha i think they should see it as an opportunity to bring the industry into compliance and make it the socially responsible backstretch that we all want to see
8446316 simply put without the backstretch workers there would be no saratoga
8446317 if the shoe were on the other foot and obama were your misguided cause this letter would still read the same
8446318 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8446319 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8446320 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8446321 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8446322 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8446323 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8446324 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8446325 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history

8446490 we plan to work very closely with kenny and the entire pro organization who have accomplished countless numbers of great things for our sport many of which have gone unnoticed
8446491 by coming together as a group really for the first time well be able to focus on what the most immediate and most important issues are and then work closely with pro and nhra to see what we can do about instituting any changes that might be necessary over the years weve always shared our opinions and ideas when were out of our cars but by getting together in a more formal way with three drivers representing the whole contingent we can have that unified voice by working with pro and nhra we can all make the sport better and safer and i know everyone cares deeply about that
8446492 last week you climb into something you dont really know what to expect you know that the team is a good solid young team with good equipment last week worked out ok we just knew there was potential to be better we got done what we needed to get done were excited to go to fontana i like fontana weve won some nascar west races out there its just a fun track nice and wide like michigan you can run all over the thing im looking forward to it
8446493 it makes it a track where you can move around if youre car is doing one thing you arent stuck to that one spot on the race track you can move around and work on making your car react different which is really nice some places have one groove and you run that groove and thats it even bristol now bristol used to be our worst case of one groove and now its a multi groove race track and your can really affect how your cars working
8446494 ive been pretty fortunate that ive been able to do it the last couple of years i didnt do both of them last year because i didnt run fontana tony stewart has been awful good to me after the race ill get on a helicopter with tony and fly to the airport well get on his plane and hell drop me off at the carbondale ill airport ill hop in the rental car grab a shower at the hotel and then meet the boys in the lobby because i think practice is at 9 a m its been fun every year because after we get out the cars tony and i usually talk all the way to illinois which isnt that long of a flight its three and a half hours or something but when youre going through those time zones you get on the plane at 11 p m in fontana and youre all pumped up and then its 5 a m in illinois when you land its kind of like oh shoot this could be a long day weve won duquoin the last two years so were looking forward to going back there
8446495 there are lot of guys in the cup series that would help if i couldnt work that out with tony someone would help out tony going back to indiana as opposed to charlotte makes that a lot easier theres a lot of guys in the cup series that even if they had to fly a little north and go out of their way to illinois i think theyd help because theyre basically all good guys in our sport because you take some much equipment and such a large team to showcase your talent you cant just do it by yourself we tend to have a lot of participants that really appreciate things and have really worked their way up through and are more than glad to pay back
8446496 theres no adjustment on this stuff youve got this circle you sit in a car youve only got a couple of pedals that do anything and you go around the circle as fast as you can when i was coming up through the ranks there was no adjustment there were nights we ran the midget the winged sprint car and the late model all in the same night if youve dealt with enough drivers its not like were rocket scientists which is why theres only two pedals one go one stop pretty simple
8446497 i knew i was going to run duquoin in january i knew that i wasnt quite sure about fontana i knew i was going to race this weekend i knew i was going to race thursday friday saturday sunday and duquoin on monday now instead of racing thursday friday saturday sunday im going to fly thursday qualify friday practice saturday and race sunday i knew i was going to be in a car all weekend now being as that you do this for a living the best car to be in is a sprint cup car plus whats really fun and especially going in as a pitch hitter like we did last week its fun to go in there and get something done last week was 21 st its not like it was eighth but it was in the top half and we knew we should have been better because the car was faster than that so it felt good i sense that the boys were pumped up we could have done better but you feel like youve accomplished something when the odds are stacked against you a little bit
8446498 i was scared i kept thinking about my life is in this house right here
8446499 i had people on this street that ive never even seen before grabbing hoses and people from over there pointing to the next street who came because the fire department was stretch so thin before they even got here
8446500 it is tough economic times i actually run a business that does this type of work and i got three houses that i am doing for free to help people get things taken care of
8446501 it was so devastating what happened up there out on that ridge and so you know anything we can do to make someones life a little easier right now i know it is not long term
8446502 we expect this growth to continue in the current financialyear with a number of projects expected to make initial orsignificantly increased contributions to origins financialperformance
8446503 john mccain doesnt think 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8446504 that bush third term message has to be made very strongly
8446505 hillary spoke eloquently of the struggles and triumphs of the american experience the greatest country in the history of the world

8446537 i was disappointed to hear about the presidents threat to veto the washington dc appropriations bill because of the domestic partner registry
8446538 it is particularly sad that the president would choose to issue this threat during pride month which should be a celebration of glbt americans contributions to our nation as well as a celebration of the strides our nation has made towards full equality
8446539 benefited from our business system and geographic diversity which mitigated the impact of sharp increases in raw material and other input costs
8446540 im excited especially going back home and after watching the last three games from my house
8446541 hes a guy that did well for us as a rookie and we felt like he was really making improvements over the summer its unfortunate that he had a setback but now that hes back hell be a quality guy for us
8446542 sitting here watching the last three games its kind of disheartening it puts things in perspective for you and you realize that at any time it can be taken away from you
8446543 as far as im concerned im ready to go now
8446544 i dont see a great falloff and like he told you that injury is not an issue because its not there anymore
8446545 what better thing than to have whatever ailment you had removed and thats where hes at right now
8446546 we lost a little depth losing jayme mitchell so it has really raised brians stock
8446547 if he can continue to improve hell be a great addition to what we are trying to get accomplished
8446548 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8446549 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8446550 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8446551 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8446552 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8446553 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8446554 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a and an international
8446555 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8446556 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8446557 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8446558 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg
8446559 and you dont know the extent of it so it scares you when the ambulance comes we know hes in good hands
8446560 i dont know mats sundins travel plans but were not signing mats sundin
8446561 this was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8446562 the players association after discussions with the commissioners office players agents and other parties viewed it necessary to file a grievance challenging this plainly unlawful unilateral act by the commissioners office
8446563 and believe me when i tell you i thought i was rich
8446564 scott has a great understanding of the business and i think thats where these other guys fall short
8446565 they dont know the business and they dont know the people in it they come in and they overspend and they upset people they start cliques and antagonize people and get distracted from the business
8446566 scotts secret is that he doesnt get out there fighting with people he sits down with you and says hey lets see if we can do business together and help each other out hes a square dude if he can do something for you or with you he will if he cant hell tell you why
8446567 he puts on a good show and i think if you talked to his fighters about him theyd all have good things to say
8446568 i thought elite xc was the stuff anna nicole smith was taking when she died
8446569 it was a stupid concept that i told you would never work
8446570 i have a long martial arts background and i have relationships with a lot of people in this business that go back many many years and im in an area of the country where martial arts is huge
8446571 there are a lot of gyms with great world class talent here in my area i have relationships with all of those places and the people there and it helps to be able to run a business
8446572 im not surprised by anything scott does because hes that good at this
8446573 hes been around 20 plus years and everyone in the business knows him and respects him he has the ability to go not only national with this thing but international if he wants he knows talent and he knows how to put together a fight
8446574 just throwing a ton of money at it doesnt work just hiring a million people doesnt work people want a good product and they want value for their money and thats what they get from strikeforce thats all because of what scott coker does
8446575 im just trying to come in and learn the playbook as fast as i can pick up some of the offense so i can go out there and try to showcase what i can do
8446576 whether it be punt return or offense i just want to contribute to the team
8446577 theres been a little bit of everything as far as picking a team whether its the last game first game
8446578 ive seen guys who dont really play in the preseason make it but its some kind of past performance that you make the decision on you just hope you make the right decisions
8446579 its the last chance i get to show my talents
8446580 i expect to get a lot of playing time a lot of reps so i have to take advantage of it
8446581 mark was such a brilliant artist his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile

8446641 were extremely excited to be showing off the new paint scheme that will be featured on our mustang funny car this weekend
8446642 we at ford have been very involved in a lot of unique ways of raising money for jdrf over the years so we decided that this was a great opportunity to use a national stage like nhra drag racing to help create awareness for jdrf and the great work they do in trying to find a cure for type 1 diabetes
8446643 our management and people like edsel ford ii have committed a lot of time and effort to help nhra funny car effort at the sports biggest race to raise more than 84 000 for jdrf and just as importantly give the cause national exposure i think everyone is going to be excited when they see the winning design
8446644 when ford motor companys customer service division approached us about donating one of their paint schemes to jdrf earlier this year we were thrilled
8446645 jdrf has had a long relationship with ford motor company and to be able to partner with fcsd in this fun and creative way to help raise funds and awareness for type 1 diabetes and at the same time provide a one of kind opportunity to jdrf families is really exciting for us

8446667 i feel sorry for peter that i must fight him skeptical people say that i wont win because i have been out of the ring for three years but i did not lose the title i am honored to fight for wbc president jos sulaim n who gave me this chance

8446669 i dont underestimate peter he is a good puncher i will give my best to be the winner to take my title back and to make history where two brothers will be champions at the same time its a huge motivation for me

8446678 the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain

8446688 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8446689 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8446690 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8446714 maybe im wrong but it doesnt sound like cn is even meeting with people i back right up to the tracks and i feel its going to kill business in barrington hopefully what will come out of this is that cn decides to work with the suburbs but my opinion is that they dont care
8446715 the purpose of the walk to me is that it shows something outside the controlled environment that cn has managed to arrange theyre trying to fine tune everything to make sure its as pretty as can be
8446716 theres a lot of energy to keep barrington the way it is
8446717 i hope that they see its important to stand up for things you believe in or in this case thing you dont believe in
8446718 nobody wants to impede progress but theyre leaving communities to bear the brunt of this
8446719 its an autonomous board not under the control of congress

8446732 by pouring the liquid light into the glasses the object meaning is given to the light two new lamps have been created however the liquid remaining in the bottle reminds you of its intangible essence there is no need of a lamp in order to have light light remains unattached to an object and able to be placed in any imagined context

8446735 i have a team of experts that has been on site for three days looked at all the data and they have yet to be able to say what they feel is the root cause

8446737 i dont know the exact date but positive results for listeria inside a food plant are common
8446738 they review maple leafs records on a regular basis and they review our remedial plans and actions
8446739 i absolutely do not believe that this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators
8446740 knowing that there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
8446741 im not suggesting that that is an option in this case when product is recalled then a range of options can be employed
8446742 disposal and destruction is one of those options product may go to rendering and through rendering then that product can be reworked the listeria would be destroyed and that product could then be used in the production of animal feed provided that the product meets our requirements
8446743 just because its gone out the door you dont know you simply dont know theres no statistical way to test that product adequately
8446744 to test a product you destroy the product to test 100 per cent of the product means you destroy 100 per cent of your product
8446745 we do plan to change the system to make sure that we have greater responsibility on those who ultimately market the product there has to be shared responsibility
8446746 there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible throughout this particular crisis we will evaluate everything weve learned from it and make sure that the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8446747 we are working with the fbi and international authorities to investigate further
8446748 there is no evidence of any unauthorized access to any other customer data
8446749 while even one compromised record is too much the fact is that our time till purge our hotel anti virus software and our organizational response succeeded in minimizing exposure in this instance
8446750 beyond that if someone wants to target your system and they have the right tools you will be compromised organizations often discount the need to invest in security event management sem solutions and in the people to monitor them

8446776 qgc has the means and the resources to implement its vertical integration strategy to supply a cleaner fuel for qgc owned gas fired power stations in australia and for the qld lng project with bg group
8446777 patients dont generally sit in waiting rooms for 24 hours they sit in corridors
8446778 this is a regular occurrence its been the worst i have seen it in a good number of years
8446779 elective surgery is the only thing we have any control over
8446780 we need something radical like putting elective cancer surgery on hold
8446781 we need to get away from 100 per cent occupancy at hospitals and get it down to 80 per cent to cope during the peak demand
8446782 we need about 20 per cent more beds in hospitals across queensland
8446783 we are building more hospitals we have open 778 new hospital beds over the last couple of years we have opened new emergency departments at prince charles hospital expanded the emergency departments at redcliffe caboolture and i could go on
8446784 we have population growth of about two per cent a year yet our emergency department presentations are increasing by 10 per cent a year and in some parts of the state like the gold coast and townsville over 30 per cent a year
8446785 perhaps you should research mr franks record a little more

8446796 with encouragement for those working in the field to continue the very important work we do for the defence of privacy and individual dignity in our community
8446797 privacy is integral to our personalities and its essential to our homes our families and our very identity
8446798 these changes have produced important new challenges which the alrc has now placed before the parliament and the community
8446799 i noted of course the responses in the local media which have been overwhelmingly negative but we dont normally in our rule of law country leave it to those who are affected to be judges in their own cause
8446800 normally we lay down the principles either in parliament or in the courts and its preferable that they be laid down in parliament
8446801 mrs roosevelt and her committee produced the universal declaration of human rights
8446802 that started the great moves of the international community towards the statement of the fundamental principle of respecting the privacy of individuals
8446803 not only grappled with the thorny issues but communicated those challenges and opportunities to a wider audience
8446804 justice kirby led the development of the 1980 oecd guidelines on the protection of privacy and the trans border flows of personal data
8446805 those guidelines are still the basis for privacy laws not only in australia but in most developed nations
8446806 justice kirby also chaired the oecd expert group on security of information systems whose work produced the 1992 guidelines on information security
8446807 new themes and colors will let you design the look of your inbox so your personality can really shine through
8446808 we believe that the justice system will prevail and that our client will be found innocent
8446809 this case has no weight its a web of lies
8446810 te v a poner haciendo el pino puente en madison
8446811 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8446812 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8446813 we want to know what kind of destruction the dems have in store for our nation should obama be elected
8446814 we have to figure out a way to get them to play better special teams
8446815 some of it is committing resources i e people the other part of that is coaching it better and them playing better were trying to do all three well see
8446816 youre talking about the no 2 unit in the country in kickoff returns and the player who was no 1 it doesnt get a lot more challenging than that
8446817 i think we need to get better at it and then it will have a bigger role
8446818 i have confidence in them so anxiety isnt the word
8446819 when the lights come on i believe they will do it i believe they have the right temperament the right personality the skills they have theres no doubt about that but what happens when they get under pressure
8446820 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8446821 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8446822 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8446823 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8446824 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8446825 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8446826 in 2005 the previous commonwealth government agreed to include the public interest monitor in the application process for preventative detention orders under its terrorism legislation
8446827 but it would not agree to our request to amend commonwealth legislation to include the public interest monitor in the case of phone tap warrant applications
8446828 this is about striking the right balance between important police activities and very legitimate privacy concerns of our citizens
8446829 i thank the prime minister for working with the queensland government to secure an outcome that protects our citizens this is collaborative federalism at work
8446830 every other state in australia has telephone interception powers but queenslands labor government has deliberately resisted for 10 years
8446831 the lnp has maintained its support for telephone interception powers and twice introduced the relevant legislation for it to happen
8446832 both times the beattie bligh government have voted down the legislation denying our states law enforcement officers the valuable resource they deserve

8446836 these discussions will have no impact on the on going management of bbm in the normal course of business nor on bbms ownership of either eircom or golden pages
8446837 although the independent directors are hopeful that the discussions will lead to agreement with babcock amp brown concerning the future management of bbc they are not in a position to provide any assurance that this will be the outcome of the discussions
8446838 the board believes that it is not appropriate to proceed with the buy back whilst these discussions are ongoing
8446839 the board did not take the decision to defer the off market buyback lightly
8446840 the board needs to consider the impact an internalisation of management proposal might have the board believes that shareholders should know the outcome of the discussions with babcock amp brown before having to decide whether they will participate in the off market buyback
8446841 babcock amp brown is committed to having both listed and unlisted managed funds in areas of core focus
8446842 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8446843 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8446844 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8446845 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8446846 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8446847 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8446848 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8446849 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8446850 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8446851 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8446852 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that here
8446853 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts
8446854 anarchy media player wp spam plugin best free stuff computerworld
8446855 it shows that small business confidence in the rudd government has collapsed to the lowest level ever
8446856 the rudd government is now the one government in australia in which small business has the least confidence
8446857 they have relentlessly treasurer mr wayne swan and prime minister mr kevin rudd talked up inflation and talked down the economy
8446858 they have undermined confidence and they have undermined prospects for jobs prospects for business and prosperity
8446859 mr swan wanted to create an inflation crisis he wanted to drive interest rates up so that he could pin the blame on the previous government
8446860 well mr swan succeeded in driving interest rates up he succeeded in driving business confidence down and hes succeeding in driving australians out of jobs

8446864 its one of the many aspects we will be looking at communication covers a wide range of issues such as if there was miscommunication misunderstanding and other issues
8446865 were at a very early stage we have no specific direction we are looking slowly carefully and thoroughly seeking to make sure we know what went on before we analyse or form a conclusion
8446866 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster
8446867 we have supplies pre positioned but people need to make their own plans as well now is the time to make sure you have gas in the car food and prescriptions
8446868 theres buses theres drivers theres planes theres trains theres a whole different strategy for getting people out starting with the people who have special medical needs
8446869 the big question is what shape are our levees in
8446870 the stock route network is very valuable for the conservation of australias biodiversity
8446871 the management in queensland may well be handed over or leased permanently to local landowners who will graze them like they graze the rest of their property which is very different for biodiversity and has a very different impact on species
8446872 in queensland the stock route network is 2 6 million hectares and its a really important corridor or connection across the whole state
8446873 generally the childs fear is real and the symptoms are real
8446874 the more we educate our kids the more awareness we create in them the better off we all are going to be
8446875 i think children who are bullied are often those children who dont succeed those kids who are quite shy a little bit withdrawn in the classroom at times they may be those kids who drop out of school
8446876 i think the most important thing is to read your child know your child sit down daily have that dialogue with your baby how are you doing today whats feeling comfortable is everything ok
8446877 i think sometimes talking about it is difficult but verbalizing it in a different form is much easier for them it almost removes them from the situation
8446878 often they have low self esteem or lack self confidence we need to ask ourselves how are we going to help the child we are working with and help build them up
8446879 and i must say that he is a kinder gentler old man now
8446880 britain looks likely to be the first major economy to fall into recession
8446881 there is a growing danger that the downturn will be exacerbated by a contraction in bank lending to households and companies
8446882 its weird to look down and hey theyre not sweating
8446883 when i was younger growing up i had social anxiety didnt like new situations meeting new people
8446884 most patients go back to work after two or three days
8446885 i can go and meet new people im a happier person
8446886 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
8446887 the worst hit are the people in kandhamal district where more than 400 churches more than 500 houses and many christian institutions have been demolished
8446888 the law enforcing agencies have not been able to contain the violent elements that are still at large
8446889 the violent mobs are destroying churches orphanages hostels of children convents of religious women and houses of christian families there appears a sense of helplessness among the christian community that has borne the brunt of the communal frenzy created by some fundamentalist organizations
8446890 one of them had died on monday and the other on tuesday both died after mobs attacked them
8446891 a third person was rescued in a critical condition but died on tuesday night in the hospital
8446892 we have given orders to shoot at sight anybody defying curfew and indulging in violence
8446893 the situation in orissa is far too worrisome and delicate there has been a total break down of law and order resulting from barbaric communal attacks by anti christian elements on innocent and peace loving christians their priests nuns religious workers their churches and organizations
8446894 efforts must be made to rein in violence and the must intervene effectively to restore peace in the state
8446895 we will also send our own delegation to the state to take stock of ground realities
8446896 we are also deeply shocked and anguished to hear of the atrocities and violence meted out to the innocent christians and churches in orissa as a backlash of the sorrowful event
8446897 we are praying for an immediate halt to the violence
8446898 what is most disturbing is that these attacks seem to be well organized and orchestrated
8446899 we have reports that the vhp have actually held strategy meetings in order to plan and coordinate this campaign of violence against peaceful christian families and churches
8446900 we thank god that the government officials are protecting our bible college campus and trying to protect our people
8446901 and now there is great tension prevailing and christians are running away for their lives
8446902 we must pray with all earnestness for the suffering church in orissa at this time
8446903 work together to re establish between the members of the various communities the peaceful coexistence and the harmony that have always marked indian society
8446904 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8446905 so different now than it used to be do you miss it

8446911 the biggest one is the drop in the legal threshold for intoxication
8446912 our officers will be enforcing that a lot of the other ones there will be a break in period
8446913 you know i just had a quarterback controversy not controversy but competition i just went through this whole thing in three games
8446914 i needed every one of those games and to be honest with you now i need the fourth game to get a few other people some work as we get on in this since ive been in this league there have been four preseason games ive coached offensive linemen that came down to the fourth week i have some decisions that will be made here in the fourth week i dont mind it being the way it is
8446915 thats the tough thing about it nobody knows when youre ready but yourself
8446916 so you dont want to let anybody down and you feel like youre letting guys down by not being back so you try to hurry back but you want to take your time so its tough the guys like vonnie he had a hamstring injury too he just told me take my time and you dont want to rush things back theyve been supporting me
8446917 were just going to take him out there were going to let him go through pregame warm ups and do those kinds of things and get a feel for where he is
8446918 id like to try to play him and get something out of him that way if we can play him well see whether or not we can get some carries
8446919 this week we need to get him involved we are going to try to get him involved earlier and get him a little longer look
8446920 he has practiced much better in the last 10 days ive been really pleased with the way hes practiced it almost looks like hes got a little bit of a second wind right now hes playing a little bit faster with more confidence
8446921 this guy has been playing in games in this league and hes done very well
8446922 we need to take that into consideration when we look at it but i look at the whole body of work in training camp i think thats important for us to look at he is a guy thats getting a lot better right now
8446923 one of the things we did when we started here is we sat in a room and i said look around you theres 80 of you but theres not going to be 80 of you theres going to be 53 when this things ends some people have to go and thats just the way it goes
8446924 its part of the business it doesnt make it any less of a strain one way or another you feel for the guys this is their livelihood too
8446925 they have sweatsuits and cheerleader sweatshirts they can wear with their jeans and if we have a pep rally or something they can go and change
8446926 as we live in the wonderful country that we live in many people have different interpretations of what fits within their community
8446927 we expect them to dress modestly but at the same time we recognize they are wearing cheerleading outfits
8446928 clearly constitutes a threat to the health and safety of students or disrupts the educational process will be prohibited
8446929 so much so that the man confessed to his involvement in a bizarre terror plot
8446930 a one legged individual has been detained under new terror legislation the suspect came quietly without kicking up a fuss although several officers are being treated for wounds inflicted by a greyhounds tail
8446931 its stupid how happy this loaf of bread has made me
8446932 going back to the break even point of the day
8446933 you had a lackluster auction and that is why the price is in line with the market
8446934 we need foreigners to be buying our debt because we dont have enough internal demand to be buying it
8446935 the durable goods orders came out to be much stronger than expected
8446936 the bond market is now thinking that perhaps the economy is not as weak as it had thought
8446937 on the other hand there is the opposing school that higher oil prices are a tax on the consumer
8446938 if oil prices would go up that would mean the consumer would have less money to spend on other items and that would weaken the economy
8446939 the graveyards of the world are full of indispensable people
8446940 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8446941 mentally stable and medically fit to run for political office free of any of his previous symptoms
8446942 obtained illegal gratification and undue pecuniary advantage in the form of commissions and kickbacks in the purchase
8446943 i saw many specialists about my health over two and a half years
8446944 i had mris magnetic resonance imaging done but the doctors found nothing wrong with my heart there was a time when i thought i was dying as i was so weak that i lost control of my bladder and bowel movements and i developed a great fear of death
8446945 it was so bad that in those early years i had to take 16 pills per day for my condition
8446946 the psychological problems masked my menopausal symptoms as the overriding concern was managing my mental health at that time i had frightening hallucinations and there came a point when i almost gave up on my life
8446947 i dont think i would have survived without the loving support of my husband and children and some very dear friends
8446948 in retrospect my neurosis was triggered during my perimenopause which lasted about 10 years
8446949 for the past two years i didnt have my period except for some spotting recently however i am still managing my neurosis
8446950 there was once when the bleeding was so bad that i wet the bed the next morning i could not get up as i felt extremely weak
8446951 so i was not afraid about the huge blood clots and the amount of blood i was losing
8446952 last december the blood clots and flow were particularly heavy i went to see my gynaecologist who did a procedure similar to a d amp c dilation and curettage to flush out the clots
8446953 after the procedure i had regular periods for three months
8446954 my gynae tells me that my perimenopause is likely to continue for the next four to six years
8446955 my mothers perimenopause was so bad that once we had to carry her as she was too weak to get up by herself
8446956 i learnt about my hot flushes and mood swings from health magazines my symptoms were quite mild and though i may have two periods in one month they were diminishing flows and spotting i probably hit menopause in december 2003
8446957 i had gone for my usual medical check up and the result showed a cyst in my womb though it was a non cancerous growth the gynae recommended a hysterectomy
8446958 i went to two other specialists and they too agreed with the first gynae i had my uterus and ovaries removed in december 2002 and have been on hormone replacement therapy since
8446959 whoever looks at such a vivid presentation and is not heartbroken and does not dissolve in tears and ponder the gravity of his sins must be harder than the marble to which this meek humble and most obedient lamb is tied
8446960 in fact the expression on christs face is one of compassion the image works as a vehicle for intimate conversation between the sinner and christ one might even say that the sculpture achieves its potential only when it fulfills this devotional function
8446961 carduchos image perfectly communicates the now accepted belief in the possibility of a private relationship with god
8446962 there can be no question that the duke of lerma was a very pious man
8446963 the inquisition and other institutions promoted social peace by suppressing the religious diversity and dissent that created civil and military conflict elsewhere in western europe
8446964 it is a paradox therefore that while society offered new possibilities to artists in spain artists also suffered under the hierarchical structure of spanish society which according to bernard vincent had never been more exclusive there was an obsession with proving limpieza de sangre clean blood without taint of jewish or moorish ancestry and with no family ties to a new christian a converso or a morisco
8446965 it was definitely the one black mark on the otherwise holy career of juan de ribera beatified in 1796 canonized in 1960 three hundred thousand moriscos were forced to leave for france and north africa 10 000 to 12 000 lost their lives resisting expulsion
8446966 you see and feel it as a cloud or a strong eagle rising upwards and carrying you away on its wings
8446967 perhaps because the mystical movement that spread over the rest of europe in the 13th and 14th centuries bypassed spain that countrys first experience with mysticism was expressed in the emotional intensity often achieved by painters and sculptors of this time
8446968 the system is functioning the way it is supposed to and we are restoring integrity to the zoning process
8446969 the bridgewater loan is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world
8446970 the present initiative is intended to secure the long term future of the loan for the public benefit we are delighted to be working in close collaboration with the duke and our colleagues in london in order to achieve this

8446984 i dont really think that people who play classical music are artists unless they write their own music a virtuoso is a different matter entirely but differs from playing someone elses music beyond that
8446985 ok i need to remove you from my life you are a psycho vampire and my patience with your bullshit has created a lie in which you do not understand that you are about to be stripped of your delusion of control in one sadistic sweep im going to spare you the humiliation

8446997 has traced the origin of the funding of 9 11 back to financial accounts in pakistan where high ranking and well known al qaeda operatives played a major role in moving the money forward eventually into the hands of the hijackers located in the us
8446998 on the eve of the publication of its report the 9 11 commission was given a stunning document from pakistan claiming that pakistani intelligence officers knew in advance of the 9 11 attacks
8446999 pakistan gave tens of thousands of dollars through its lobbyists in the united states to members of the 9 11 inquiry commission to convince them to drop some anti pakistan findings in the report
8447000 pakistan has never indulged in the illegal activity of bribing or buying influence anywhere in the world
8447001 a possible isi role in the 9 11 plot remains unclear

8447023 i dont have any doubt that they are acting out of concern for everyones safety
8447024 bicyclists who do ride through the transit center add an element of unpredictability that compromises any operators power to be careful and prevent a crash on that street
8447025 in neither direction is the existing route acceptable for any but the hardiest bicyclists a major crossroads in the portland bike network should not be challenging and unsafe it should be intuitive easy and low traffic
8447026 confident that this solution will normalize bicyclist behavior and create a more predictable operating environment than operators are currently faced with and will also bridge an unacceptable gap in portlands otherwise good network of bicycle routes by connecting n portland the lloyd district and the river more safely and comfortably than ever before
8447027 what is the existing route from the esplanade to williams anyway
8447028 for northbound bike traffic besides being indirect and uphill which are minor concerns the current route involves multiple acute angle track crossings and requires people to merge across two lanes of car traffic and then wait with their left arm stuck out but not too far or someones side view mirror will hit it in the middle of the intersection to make a left turn off of multnomah and on to wheeler

8447033 this is a democratic county this part of the state so why isnt barack obama an easy sell
8447034 i still think its because people dont know him that well thats what i think

8447036 yes but probably race is an issue for some people still
8447037 we need to put the right person in the white house
8447038 race is its one of the touchiest most sensitive subjects in american culture and life and its going to play a role in this election both to help obama and hurt obama
8447039 there is no question even though racial prejudice has decreased over time there is still some of it out there and it will show up at the polls
8447040 will there be some folks who probably dont vote for me because i am black of course yeah but the question is can we get a majority of the american people to give us a fair hearing

8447079 alice and dick had their own idea of what we were supposed to sound like
8447080 we werent happy with how the record sounded but we had a hell of a time hanging out in the studio with alice and dick it was crazy
8447081 ill tell you one thing i was on coke the whole time i was doing those vocals there was so much coke in the studio and yeah i did coke the whole time
8447082 my voice is a lot different than what it sounds like on that record that was just an embarrassment that ive tried to live down ever since
8447083 there was a lot of heartache there was a lot of f heartache in that band
8447084 there were a lot of people who got strung out on drugs and there was a lot of alcohol

8447086 we were picked by people magazines stars of the future next to tom cruise and glenn close was us you obviously know what happened there
8447087 it was how a rock n roll show should be with the crowd packed up to the front of the stage

8447106 it shows that small business confidence in the rudd government has collapsed to the lowest level ever
8447107 the rudd government is now the one government in australia in which small business has the least confidence
8447108 they have relentlessly treasurer mr wayne swan and prime minister mr kevin rudd talked up inflation and talked down the economy
8447109 they have undermined confidence and they have undermined prospects for jobs prospects for business and prosperity
8447110 mr swan wanted to create an inflation crisis he wanted to drive interest rates up so that he could pin the blame on the previous government
8447111 well mr swan succeeded in driving interest rates up he succeeded in driving business confidence down and hes succeeding in driving australians out of jobs
8447112 if yesterdays statement from mr rudd was about a new direction for the future then australians need to be very very worried about the economic future of this country
8447113 this has been the most devastating fire weve seen in recent memory

8447129 our car shook and our blinds like flew off the window and it felt like the house shook too i thought a car hit our house or something
8447130 once we saw the flames i was trying to help out my dad and like in any way i could
8447131 there was no fire inside the house there was some smoke damage throughout the house and the attic
8447132 i couldnt find justin until he squirted me in the face with the hose when i tucked my head in the garage door and then i knew he was okay
8447133 the smoke was so bad and i couldnt go inside because i couldnt see so i was freaking out and i thought abby was going to pass out in there from the smoke
8447134 this is their passion so its really sad to see this happen to them
8447135 if my dad wasnt here the house probably could have caught on fire

8447139 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8447140 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8447141 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
8447142 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
8447143 its just one of the tactics they use to try to incite a reaction
8447144 we buy overstocks and closeouts from name brand authentic manufacturers sometimes however supplies are limited and stock changes on a daily or hourly basis our website gives people the chance to own high quality merchandise and a discount price

8447147 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8447148 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it

8447154 philip morris documents show the majority of the companys internal reports regarding po 210 polonium 210 were not published one manuscript believed by some philip morris scientists to be favourable to the tobacco industry was withheld from publication for fear of heightening public awareness of po 210
8447155 unlike other smoking and health issues where the industry line was to create doubt in relation to polonium 210 and the radioactivity of cigarettes the companies wanted to hide from that issue publicly they continue to minimise the recognition of radioactivity in their products in smoking and health litigation
8447156 its fairly common knowledge polonium 210 is in cigarette smoke because its present in all such plant types including strawberries
8447157 there was a 1977 study that found of the daily intake of the polonium 210 in a smoker 77 3 per cent came from food and 17 per cent from tobacco the world health organisation is trying to determine which constituents of tobacco smoke are most important in diseases including lung cancer but as yet have not concluded polonium 210 is a priority constituent
8447158 first of all this is a cell phone that costs 600
8447159 personally im wondering whats taking apple so long with the first software update its been almost a month after all and isnt the iphone supposed to be a rapidly evolving platform
8447160 this thread is not an excuse to have a general bitchfest either its counterproductive to whine here about at amp t as a service provider or not being able to get activated unless its the software thats preventing the activation you should be posting actual software bugs you discover and report anything else is a thread hijack attempt
8447161 i dont use custom eq and i dont use the on the go playlist so id be fine anyway

8447164 i cringe when ever i see pictures of these horror stories
8447165 at home the husband is the master and the wife is out of doors
8447166 priscillas background and success in ad sales and marketing in both traditional and online media is a perfect fit for this senior sales management position on the east coast
8447167 she has a track record of exceeding revenue goals at every position shes held and has been a significant contributor to reaching profitability goals for her former employers
8447168 the single biggest thing i learned is that you have to get your ego out of the way to do the job
8447169 to get the best out of people you have to trust them and you have to let them help you do your job
8447170 with a film like this i want to entertain first and if i can smuggle in some of those ideas and if i can smuggle in some of that more thought provoking material so you walk out with that in your head then thats the goal
8447171 if im having to do too much research its usually because theres something missing in the script and in this case the script was really quite detailed and the information that i felt like i need personally to sort of move forward and act was very much there
8447172 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8447173 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8447174 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8447175 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8447176 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8447177 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8447178 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8447179 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8447180 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8447181 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8447182 special projects i really have no wish to ogle at clothes i cant afford and sigh
8447183 democrats nominate most hard core socialist in seventy six years
8447184 the contest in november will be divided among those who believe in the marxist philosophy of government those who believe in jeffersonian republicanism and those who know little or nothing about either
8447185 in 2005 the previous commonwealth government agreed to include the public interest monitor in the application process for preventative detention orders under its terrorism legislation
8447186 but it would not agree to our request to amend commonwealth legislation to include the public interest monitor in the case of phone tap warrant applications
8447187 this is about striking the right balance between important police activities and very legitimate privacy concerns of our citizens
8447188 i thank the prime minister for working with the queensland government to secure an outcome that protects our citizens this is collaborative federalism at work
8447189 every other state in australia has telephone interception powers but queenslands labor government has deliberately resisted for 10 years
8447190 the lnp has maintained its support for telephone interception powers and twice introduced the relevant legislation for it to happen
8447191 both times the beattie bligh government have voted down the legislation denying our states law enforcement officers the valuable resource they deserve
8447192 if i ever meet luke perry i may collapse i dont know what ill do
8447193 you have to catch their eye when you flip channels so its very provocative very racy very sexy
8447194 my birthday is next week and im getting the 380 ruger and a 38 revolver
8447195 get in your i suppose i had nothing to say a year ago today http twitpic com 99ke forget it everyone os standing they sound amazing
8447196 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8447197 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8447198 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8447199 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8447200 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8447201 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8447202 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so
8447203 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8447204 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8447205 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8447206 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8447207 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8447208 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8447209 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8447210 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8447211 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8447212 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8447213 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that here
8447214 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts
8447215 patients dont generally sit in waiting rooms for 24 hours they sit in corridors
8447216 this is a regular occurrence its been the worst i have seen it in a good number of years
8447217 elective surgery is the only thing we have any control over
8447218 we need something radical like putting elective cancer surgery on hold
8447219 we need to get away from 100 per cent occupancy at hospitals and get it down to 80 per cent to cope during the peak demand
8447220 we need about 20 per cent more beds in hospitals across queensland
8447221 we are building more hospitals we have open 778 new hospital beds over the last couple of years we have opened new emergency departments at prince charles hospital expanded the emergency departments at redcliffe caboolture and i could go on
8447222 we have population growth of about two per cent a year yet our emergency department presentations are increasing by 10 per cent a year and in some parts of the state like the gold coast and townsville over 30 per cent a year
8447223 oh i wish id done that or i wish id done that
8447224 little or no effect on the polls in the short run or on the final outcome of the election in the long run
8447225 presidential elections are about the top guy on the ticket
8447226 stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction from the former ussr
8447227 there are two things joe biden brings to the ticket
8447228 ive been doing this just as long as you have and heres where youre wrong
8447229 the ability to speak to the working class voters with whom obama has really struggled
8447230 the obligatory shot to take right after the candidate is announced
8447231 america has made tremendous progress in racial and gender attitudes and rights
8447232 but racial and gender bias are still very real and prevalent with nontrivial proportions of americans indicating explicitly in surveys that they are not prepared to vote for a black or woman candidate having a doubly unconventional ticket may be too much to ask of the current american electorate
8447233 the question of how you could manage a spouse who was also an ex president
8447234 biden does nothing to bring the clinton holdouts back into the fold
8447235 this could prove to be a fatal mistake in the end
8447236 as we face difficult budget times at both state and local levels of government this bill has the potential to help protect us from cuts to important city services such as public safety
8447237 and as a long beach resident im all for that
8447238 its a very good thing for long beach and a very good thing for the state
8447239 youll start seeing some revenue right away but it wont be that much
8447240 these are not revenues we are going to realize overnight this is a long term investment it is something that proved effective 1992 with arco and were hoping will be this time around
8447241 the oil field is in need of investment in order to maintain current oil production levels as well as potentially increase production and revenues on a long term basis
8447242 hed said he had never seen anything like them before
8447243 i think they could be related to komodo dragons only not as big but you know quite large because he has seen goannas in australia but these were horrible and larger and all of a sudden this group of lizards started chasing him
8447244 im looking so forward to tearing down that home base site
8447245 ive lived in north long beach since 1976 and i cannot remember any significant development other than a couple of strip malls since ive lived there
8447246 this is like the iwo jima flag going up in north long beach
8447247 this will be the first real fruits of that labor where were going to see an economic interest move back
8447248 itll have better quality departments a cleaner format and better food service
8447249 ice breaker questions and even what job interviewers are looking for in the fabled
8447250 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8447251 it has the potential to undermine the economies of the internet
8447252 inprivate blocking was never designed to be an ad blocker though there may be ads that get blocked
8447253 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8447254 it has 200 000 miles on it so we need to get a new one
8447255 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8447256 copy the list below mark in bold the movie titles for which you read the book italicize the ones youve watched then tag five people to perpetuate the meme
8447257 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster
8447258 but i want to emphasize that our citizens have a personal responsibility
8447259 caro ges la giraffa la volevi proprio cos o stato un incidente
8447260 querido menino jesus todos os meus colegas da escola escrevem para o papai noel mas eu n o confio naquele l prefiro voc sara

8447270 querido jesus voc invis vel mesmo ou s um truque
8447271 what is the one thing on which you all agree
8447272 that obama should win the election and mccain should lose it
8447273 the date of the calendar year on which the average american worker has earned enough gross income to pay off his or her share of spending and regulatory burdens imposed by government on the federal state and local levels
8447274 working people must toil on average 197 days out of the year just to meet all costs imposed by government
8447275 in other words the cost of government consumes 53 9 percent of national income
8447276 the driving factor for this development is the fact that all components of the cost of government federal spending state and local spending and regulation are now increasing faster than national income
8447277 isnt it ironic that we celebrate independence day on july 4 to recognize our rejection of oppressive british regulation mercantilism and taxation and yet the typical american now works until the middle of july to pay for big government in other words we celebrate our declaration of independence from the british government in early july before we are even free from the burden of our current government
8447278 people dont appear to be panicking they feel that its going to be ok in 2008
8447279 im not bullish but i am satisfied even when you adjust for inflation giving still was on the plus side in 2007
8447280 i brought two bags from home but there was a third that i left behind in this new country apart from the struggles that made me a stranger were your needs of the ones who bid me goodbye those i left behind among the papers i collected you had put a small bag of sweets i left behind there were divisions at home there were other possibilities there were communities in my town there were communities where i came i found a job called it a struggle for survival everything else i left behind i didnt want to forget my traditions the tradition of forgetting i left behind bags passport my shoes crossed the yellow lines something was left behind here i am a sum of different parts travel agents everywhere are selling ads for the parts that were left behind
8447281 the magician you are powerful and wise beyond what anyone can see deeply complex you have the resources to connect to the spiritual and material world you possess the knowledge to manipulate your life and the lives around you you also have a great healing power should you choose to use it your fortune you have unhidden powers that you have yet to tap into soon you will better understand how to use your intellect and intuition believe it or not you will discover how you can manipulate yourself and others for good you are at the beginning of a path of spiritual enlightenment

8447287 to have students moved outside the airport the city boundaries is a question i cant really answer
8447288 airports in built up suburban areas are common moorabbin bankstown in sydney archerfield in brisbane and parafield in adelaide and they are also big training airports
8447289 mid air collisions are extremely rare theres not an issue of safety
8447290 the program has supported the international careers and market development of a number commercially successful western australian bands such as little birdy gyroscope end of fashion the panics and the panda band

8447292 and you dont know the extent of it so it scares you when the ambulance comes we know hes in good hands
8447293 nothing whatsoever has been decided vis a vis the next step because were only in the process of analysis at this stage
8447294 people who are saying another referendum or legislation they are all jumping ahead to an outcome and the government isnt anywhere near that
8447295 a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
8447296 the government has made it clear that no option has been ruled in or out we cannot exclude that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
8447297 there can be no question of simply putting the same proposition to the people once again
8447298 there is no basis for believing that a second referendum would produce a different outcome to the one we got on 12 june
8447299 i think he is jumping the gun i dont think its helpful i dont think its helpful to be coming out in the month of august with proposals or solutions one way or the other
8447300 could have the nature of a precedent and destabilise other regions in the world
8447301 for the first time in a generation we have more democrats than republicans

8447308 as well intended as groups may be they can sometimes make assumptions that individuals who care for them arent putting their best interests at heart its not correct
8447309 he could be picked on if we introduced him into an established group
8447310 he could be kicked out by other members of their mob

8447313 i wasnt doing it specifically to get an older audience
8447314 i was doing college just because it was fun but the kind of movie it is i hope it will bring in that older audience because thats something a bit lacking right now im fine with 6 to 16 i need some 18 to 25
8447315 if youre on a successful show its like good job executive producer and head writer if you sell 2 million records you wrote that album you toured thats your accomplishment i mean if i was winning an oscar but i dont see that happening any time soon
8447316 i didnt go to college so i at least got to experience the party part rather than the academic aspect
8447317 it was fun just to get to hang out and party for two months thats what the movie really was and saying some dialogue in between it was like watching animal house but in real life
8447318 theres a whole movie id like to shoot alongside it that were writing right now
8447319 its a princess bride romeo and juliet type story with monsters and pirates with big beards its very jellyfish and jon brion harry nilssons popeye soundtrack that type of music with a michel gondry look to it

8447326 each time i see and talk with refugees it breaks my heart
8447327 the only place these people want to be is home but they cannot go home because of what happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8447328 my job in all of this is to make sure the international community does not forget what is going on here
8447329 did i do this trip because it is during to democratic national convention
8447330 the answer is no i could not come any quicker the timing just happens to be right now

8447342 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8447343 its not a frequent occurrence but this isnt the first time
8447344 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

8447346 nine years ago we were given a blank sheet of paper and the authors were the men who fought and died here
8447347 and what our responsibility has been is to tell the story and that is what we are trying to do tell the story it is a culmination of nine years of hard work and community involvement and support it is going to be a great asset for years to come
8447348 this battlefield and woods were here for over a century and people paid no attention to it
8447349 its an opportunity to educate young people and others who need to know how important this battle was and the history of our area
8447350 it is an honor to us to be a part of this battlefield

8447361 the theme of the democratic convention is unity unfortunately they cant agree on how that works
8447362 yeah the democratic convention is in denver and security is tight out there it is very tight its tighter than nancy pelosis face
8447363 but heres what they got lined up for the democratic convention there in denver nancy pelosi will give a speech tonight then theres a film about joe biden then theres a introduction to denver by mayor hickenlooper and im telling you break out the dip cmon speakers include senator claire mccaskill senator amy klobuchar and former representative lee hamilton cut me a slice of that
8447364 joe biden is barack obamas running mate yeah nothing says change like a guy whos been in the senate for 35 years
8447365 this thursday barack obama is gonna give his acceptance speech and reportedly its going to include performances by bon jovi and bruce springsteen yeah and they say obamas not black enough
8447366 tomorrow night at the democratic convention to show her support for barack obama hillary clinton is going to give a speech
8447367 the current issue of newsweek magazine has a picture of president bush on the cover with the headline what bush got right yeah its true newsweek says what bush got right is their shortest cover story since januarys issue on famous korean rabbis
8447368 as you all know by now barack obama sent out a cell phone text message at 3 a m on saturday morning to tell everyone he picked joe biden as his vice president how do you think this makes hillary clinton feel huh finally she gets a telephone call at 3 a m its to tell her they picked joe biden
8447369 although joe biden is in great physical condition republicans are raising questions about his health now i guess he had a brain aneurysm a couple of years ago hey you cant expect every vice president to be the picture of health like dick cheney
8447370 as you know john mccain is an older white haired man who has been in the senate for over twenty years voted for the iraq war and said barack obama did not have the experience to be president im sorry thats our intro for next week when joe biden is on i got confused

8447378 cheers to your blog for supporting healthy oceans and the alaskan brewing company
8447379 as equipes de pol tica internacional de clinton e bush agiram com base em duas premissas falsas
8447380 uma que a r ssia naturalmente agressiva e que o fim da guerra fria n o poderia mudar isso ent o tivemos que expandir nossa alian a militar at suas bordas apesar do besteirol ortodoxo sobre usar a otan para promover a democracia a cren a da eterna agressividade da r ssia a nica base na qual a expans o da otan fez algum sentido especialmente quando voc considera que foi dito aos russos que eles n o podiam entrar a outra premissa que a r ssia sempre seria fraca demais para p r em perigo qualquer novo membro da otan ent o nunca ter amos que comprometer tropas para defend los isso n o custaria nada para n s eles estavam enganados em ambos os casos
8447381 foi idiota e possivelmente criminoso mas ao contr rio de putin ele tem comandado o pa s em uma dire o claramente democr tica tem contido a corrup o e esteve frente de um crescimento econ mico r pido que n o depende como a r ssia dos altos pre os do petr leo e do g s

8447388 its a wonderful tribute to athletes who have worked so hard were all pretty tired but this will lift everybody its a neat finish
8447389 the numbers are increasing probably because children are more aware of the service and more able to contact it because they have mobile phones but it also shows a serious underlying problem
8447390 our busiest times are evenings and at weekends when social services are not available we need a proper out of hours support system for children
8447391 n o concorda nem encontra amparo legal para se restringir definitivamente que candidatos invoquem nomes de autoridades p blicas mesmo que filiadas a outros partidos pol ticos
8447392 fazem propagandas ressaltando projetos realizados com o apoio n o pol tico mas institucional das pessoas que det m a representatividade governamental e do povo

8447401 there is a strong probability that it will be a category 3 storm by the time it enters the gulf and it has the potential to strengthen into a category 4 or 5 storm over the gulf
8447402 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8447403 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8447404 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8447405 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8447406 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8447407 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8447408 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8447409 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8447410 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8447411 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8447412 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8447413 my mother was born before women could vote but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up how do we give this country back to them by following the example of a brave new yorker a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the underground railroad and on that path to freedom harriett tubman had one piece of advice if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theyre shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going if you want a taste of freedom keep going even in the darkest of moments ordinary americans have found the faith to keep going
8447414 i want to be very clear since the united states is a permanent member of the un security council this simply will be dead on arrival
8447415 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8447416 this contradicts the basic principles of territorial integrity and is therefore absolutely unacceptable
8447417 this is a test for the entire world and a test for our collective solidarity today the fate of europe and the free world is unfortunately being played out in my small country

8447530 i think the regulatory process on airport systems need to be revisited in the coming weeks i am going to ask to meet with the members of our congressional delegation to see if something can be done
8447531 i do not believe under our circumstances that experimental and high risk aircraft operations such as training and solo flights belong in an urban airport
8447532 to propose that eliminating all experimental aircraft from the airport would enhance its safety record is unjustified
8447533 the answer does not lie in restricting entire segments of aviation in response to any single accident or incident rather we must continually learn from experience and continue to advance the safety of flight
8447534 no velocity accidents that have been attributable to the design of the aircraft
8447535 theres no economic model that justifies setting up a support team to support just five planes in the field
8447536 we look forward to expanding the flight envelope for this demonstrator and will continue to conduct market analysis to determine the next steps for this important program
8447537 if the proposal by the port authority is in fact discouraging open access to the airports the port authority may no longer be eligible for faa grants or payments under existing grants until the matter is resolved
8447538 the auctions will preserve competitive airline service help lower fares for service to and from the region and give new carriers an opportunity to enter the market
8447539 would result in higher costs for airlines increased ticket prices for airline passengers and fewer flights to small communities
8447540 hours they will be overwritten by the logfile of the next day
8447541 you didnt edit your config file completely like you were told did you
8447542 this new requirement only makes it more difficult for legitimate amateur builders to document compliance
8447543 it would have no effect on those who may currently fraudulently declare that their aircraft was constructed by amateurs which is what the faa wants to eliminate
8447544 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record

8447583 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8447584 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8447585 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8447586 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8447646 he has great soaring rhetoric but as the substance has come out his numbers have started coming down

8447664 when we heard that saratoga high school had 21 students interested we were really excited
8447665 we knew students who were involved in the media arts had a whole host of skills and were looking for multimedia projects to work on
8447666 we came up with a list of students who might be interested and ended up with three great teams
8447667 ebay doesnt decide what the user wants the community does that
8447668 this is a great example of that interaction we got some wonderful suggestions with all of these designs
8447669 the use of fonts and graphics was fun and also very practical
8447670 their presentation was very well done thoroughly rehearsed and suggested elements that arent currently a part of our site
8447671 this group really captured all aspects of whats important to ebay and the viability of its web site
8447672 i can take what ive learned at ebay and apply it at school
8447673 it will really help me out when im looking for a job as well normally im not much of a team player but now i know what to expect and how i can manage people better if i become part of a team
8447674 what was unique about the project was that it had no limitations the question was simply what will ebay be like in 2015 it allowed us to stretch our imaginations and come up with some out there stuff
8447675 in only eight weeks we brainstormed created our prototype and planned and practiced our presentation the experience will help our group with future projects both in and out of school
8447676 did you prepare this report or did cn prepare this report
8447677 the rules are so in favor of the railroads in this instance
8447678 divide and conquer strategy i question if they are honest brokers
8447679 no one could orchestrate this this does come from their hearts
8447680 maybe im wrong but it doesnt sound like cn is even meeting with people i back right up to the tracks and i feel its going to kill business in barrington hopefully what will come out of this is that cn decides to work with the suburbs but my opinion is that they dont care
8447681 the purpose of the walk to me is that it shows something outside the controlled environment that cn has managed to arrange theyre trying to fine tune everything to make sure its as pretty as can be
8447682 theres a lot of energy to keep barrington the way it is
8447683 i hope that they see its important to stand up for things you believe in or in this case thing you dont believe in
8447684 nobody wants to impede progress but theyre leaving communities to bear the brunt of this
8447685 its an autonomous board not under the control of congress
8447686 who can bear the thought of the perfect soft centred chip without a generous splash of malt vinegar to provide an extra burst of flavour no self respecting chippy is without the obligatory bottle of malt vinegar on the counter along with salt and perhaps tomato ketchup
8447687 hey the water is going to be sporadic this week sorry
8447688 with the internet with cable with the 15 000 journalists that we have here so many more people can experience it
8447689 being here on the ground to be part of that kind of change is something im glad is televised
8447690 its about developing the skills and developing the intellect and it teaches you how to be competitive
8447691 its being among all these democrats you know everybody thinks the way you think you can get into a conversation about things that are important for you and know youre not going to get into a confrontation
8447692 i dont know of anybody in the new york delegation who hasnt been interviewed at least once
8447693 we have already been sold so our focus is to tell the world what we believe
8447694 if youre a guest you cant sit in these seats
8447695 however it turns out and however you feel about his candidacy
8447696 about america finally beginning to come to grips with the complexity of the racial issues that have bedeviled us for so long
8447697 this is a huge step this is a generational step
8447698 the word history gets thrown around and its used rather loosely
8447699 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight
8447700 it was like watching muhammad ali come out of retirement
8447701 it is considered one of the highest honors to serve as a sentinel at the tomb of the unknown soldier
8447702 he can be a great orator said lafauci in an interview today
8447703 joe biden is very very good when he speaks from the heart says lafauci who will watch the speech on tv
8447704 i think that is what you are going to see tonight
8447705 in faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and will be the next president of the united states
8447706 pourquoi ne pourrai je pas faire des remplacements comme vendeuse ou occuper tout autre emploi
8447707 we kept saying we do not consent to any search
8447708 they refused to give us a receipt for our belongings this is completely outside what i would call a law and order society
8447709 s1 s2 and s3 were observed walking out of the railroad yard at 26th av and 6th st ne
8447710 they said they would repel the howard governments regressive waste dumping legislation in the territory and they had some very very strong things to say when they were opposing the bill on the way through the senate
8447711 nou misschien word ik directeur bij een mooie maatschappelijke organisatie of presentatrice van
8447712 leave verizon alone and partner with cingular tmobile and metropcs using gsm technology
8447713 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8447714 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8447715 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8447716 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medicine needs
8447717 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision
8447718 did you prepare this report or did cn prepare this report
8447719 the rules are so in favor of the railroads in this instance
8447720 divide and conquer strategy i question if they are honest brokers
8447721 no one could orchestrate this this does come from their hearts
8447722 maybe im wrong but it doesnt sound like cn is even meeting with people i back right up to the tracks and i feel its going to kill business in barrington hopefully what will come out of this is that cn decides to work with the suburbs but my opinion is that they dont care
8447723 the purpose of the walk to me is that it shows something outside the controlled environment that cn has managed to arrange theyre trying to fine tune everything to make sure its as pretty as can be
8447724 theres a lot of energy to keep barrington the way it is
8447725 i hope that they see its important to stand up for things you believe in or in this case thing you dont believe in
8447726 nobody wants to impede progress but theyre leaving communities to bear the brunt of this
8447727 its an autonomous board not under the control of congress
8447728 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8447729 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues correlation to relapse
8447730 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8447731 a number of of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8447732 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families
8447733 you take care of my kenkichi on the job alright
8447734 yeah because we fuckin stink cant live like this without startin to smell sooner or later
8447735 shit man four months on the open sea didnt think i could do this any more

8447745 company bigwigs the captain the supervisor and also the boss of the destroyer thatd guard the ship in kamchatka the chief of the coast guard and some briefcases from the seamens union
8447746 as some of you may know it goes without saying that this crab ships operations are not just about one company making a profit
8447747 to continue there is more to our kamchatka fishing industry than crab canning it is also important for salmon trout speaking internationally the maintenance of territories so rich that no other countrys can even compare it is a mission vital to the domestic problems of population and food that have japan up against the wall i dont expect any of you to understand a word of this but nevertheless know that this is a serious mission for the japanese empire for which we put ourselves on the line and brave the choppy northern seas that after all is why one of the emperors warships will be protecting us at all times while we are out there now i know that copying the russkies has become a bit of a trend these days but if anyone pulls anything like that out there if anyone feels like instigating something he will have done the unforgivable sold out the japanese empire itself i dont expect this to happen but i will have you remember what i have said
8447748 i mean you got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
8447749 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is its awful hard with only a little bit of experience to have a clear sense of what you would do on the most critical issues facing us today
8447750 with the internet with cable with the 15 000 journalists that we have here so many more people can experience it
8447751 being here on the ground to be part of that kind of change is something im glad is televised
8447752 its about developing the skills and developing the intellect and it teaches you how to be competitive
8447753 its being among all these democrats you know everybody thinks the way you think you can get into a conversation about things that are important for you and know youre not going to get into a confrontation
8447754 i dont know of anybody in the new york delegation who hasnt been interviewed at least once
8447755 we have already been sold so our focus is to tell the world what we believe
8447756 if youre a guest you cant sit in these seats
8447757 orange is the symbolic color of the ukrainian revolutionaries who protested the
8447758 you can dress up a pig but its still a pig
8447759 north and south are like poles apart on a compass
8447760 those scientists dont know a cows ass from its antlers
8447761 it is good for us to be here do you think hed mind if i swam out your way
8447762 we dare not forget today that we are the heirs of the first revolution let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and to which we are committed today at home and around the world
8447763 you wanna get capone heres how you get him he pulls a knife you pull a gun he sends one of yours to the hospital you send one of his to the morgue thats the chicago way
8447764 but will obama amid the pulsating theatrics also attempt the less glamorous and more difficult task of explaining specifically where he wants to move the country and how he proposes to move it above and beyond reciting his policy positions
8447765 continuing a tradition of asking world class actresses to come join us on medium i am thrilled to announce that blythe danner will appear in one of the early episodes of season 5
8447766 i have seen her work at williamstown on the broadway stage as well as on film and television and to finally have the opportunity to actually work with her is a real honor for me and an exhilarating treat for the cast
8447767 i will give thanks to the lord with my whole heart
8447768 i will sing praise to your name o most high
8447769 there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved
8447770 when my enemies turn back they stumble and perish before your presence
8447771 you have rebuked the nations you have made the wicked perish
8447772 we take this to be more suitable said to the lord jesus christ than said by him for who else hath rebuked the heathen and the ungodly perished save he who after that he ascended up into heaven sent the holy ghost that filled by him the apostles should preach the word of god with boldness and freely reprove mens sins at which rebuke the ungodly perished because the ungodly was justified and was made godly
8447773 those who know your name put their trust in you
8447774 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe
8447775 you are the god who lift s me up from the gates of death
8447776 the program has supported the international careers and market development of a number commercially successful western australian bands such as little birdy gyroscope end of fashion the panics and the panda band
8447777 ive spoken to two or three members who i know will support it because theyve supported it in the past
8447778 ive had a discussion with family first and theyre keen to talk to me about the detail
8447779 clearly its not something that theyve supported in the past but i hold out hope
8447780 the act does have need for a protection where passionate people speak out against planning and we should be able to do that without concern that we will end up in a court facing huge costs that will silence us
8447781 we are showing the way again to other states and hopefully the commonwealth so that people will have the right to speak out on issues that theyre passionate about
8447782 patients dont generally sit in waiting rooms for 24 hours they sit in corridors
8447783 this is a regular occurrence its been the worst i have seen it in a good number of years
8447784 elective surgery is the only thing we have any control over
8447785 we need something radical like putting elective cancer surgery on hold
8447786 we need to get away from 100 per cent occupancy at hospitals and get it down to 80 per cent to cope during the peak demand
8447787 we need about 20 per cent more beds in hospitals across queensland
8447788 we are building more hospitals we have open 778 new hospital beds over the last couple of years we have opened new emergency departments at prince charles hospital expanded the emergency departments at redcliffe caboolture and i could go on
8447789 we have population growth of about two per cent a year yet our emergency department presentations are increasing by 10 per cent a year and in some parts of the state like the gold coast and townsville over 30 per cent a year
8447790 it shows that small business confidence in the rudd government has collapsed to the lowest level ever
8447791 the rudd government is now the one government in australia in which small business has the least confidence
8447792 they have relentlessly treasurer mr wayne swan and prime minister mr kevin rudd talked up inflation and talked down the economy
8447793 they have undermined confidence and they have undermined prospects for jobs prospects for business and prosperity
8447794 mr swan wanted to create an inflation crisis he wanted to drive interest rates up so that he could pin the blame on the previous government
8447795 well mr swan succeeded in driving interest rates up he succeeded in driving business confidence down and hes succeeding in driving australians out of jobs
8447796 it wont only have an effect on cloncurry itll have an effect on the whole of the outback
8447797 itll just basically leave us without confidence there will be no confidence left in the bush
8447798 the sexual harassment office has been detailed back to the department of human resources pending a review by the inspector general of a dispute regarding the handling of a sexual harassment complaint
8447799 ive spoken to two or three members who i know will support it because theyve supported it in the past
8447800 ive had a discussion with family first and theyre keen to talk to me about the detail
8447801 clearly its not something that theyve supported in the past but i hold out hope
8447802 lets be clear if this law passes what happens is were making it legal for the first time to actively and deliberately kill human beings
8447803 this is something our society moved on from many many years ago and to go back is a retrograde and cynical step by the greens and they deserve to be condemned for it
8447804 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart
8447805 since ive been playing i dont think half of us have played that last preseason game
8447806 a lot is said about how preseason doesnt necessarily count but in a sense it does
8447807 not in the matter of wins or losses but in the matter of preparation and its our last game to get preparation its big for us and its another opportunity to gain some consistency within the offensive unit
8447808 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8447809 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8447810 theyre just coming in to finish off their preseason and we are going out to do the same
8447811 we are going out to win that is the only difference
8447812 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8447813 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8447814 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that michelle obama watching from her seat in the balcony stood and applauded as the former president praised her man and obama delighting the crowd with his appearance on stage praised both clintons as well as his wife for their prime time speeches this week hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8447815 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8447816 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8447817 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8447818 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8447819 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8447820 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8447821 with the internet with cable with the 15 000 journalists that we have here so many more people can experience it
8447822 being here on the ground to be part of that kind of change is something im glad is televised
8447823 its about developing the skills and developing the intellect and it teaches you how to be competitive
8447824 its being among all these democrats you know everybody thinks the way you think you can get into a conversation about things that are important for you and know youre not going to get into a confrontation
8447825 i dont know of anybody in the new york delegation who hasnt been interviewed at least once
8447826 we have already been sold so our focus is to tell the world what we believe
8447827 if youre a guest you cant sit in these seats
8447828 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8447829 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the we need
8447830 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8447831 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8447832 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8447833 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8447834 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8447835 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8447836 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8447837 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8447838 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8447839 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8447840 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8447841 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8447842 the northern territory emergency response has got a timetable in place
8447843 that timetable has demonstrated to us of course that income management as it was structured under the previous howard government was time consuming and difficult and thats in fact why we have moved towards a basics card to try to assist
8447844 its a case of meeting the requirements in the merchant agreement
8447845 im positive most of the businesses who want to participate should be able to meet those requirements the requirements arent onerous theyre about joining in the system
8447846 terst lla tron p den amerikanska dr mmen och teruppr tta usa s ledarskap i v rlden

8447849 im going to call your editor now and strongly recommend he slam your dick in a car door if you follow through on your thin skulled threat
8447850 when you go to school when the wheelchair is not good any more and its not cool its just so ewww you feel like oh god here comes another horrible day what are they going to say now
8447851 the only thing thats left in it are the screws
8447852 i can duct tape this and duct tape that but only so much you can do
8447853 i dont have to go to school in this thing
8447854 todos los detalles de los conciertos de queen y paul rodgers
8447855 go home and listen to music and then take a nap or watch tv
8447856 go for a long walk or a run on the track
8447857 demand answers from the canadian government on the maple leaf tainted meat
8447858 with sales greatly increasing in the commuting category and other categories as well we are looking forward to introducing several new products at the show
8447859 as qbp has grown with the market interbike has been and will continue to be the best venue for us to launch new products
8447860 consumers are looking for ways to save money and they are looking to bikes to help them do that both in their daily life and for recreation interbike is a direct reflection of the marketplace and the increase in the number of exhibiting companies both international and domestic suggests the industry is very healthy and has opportunities for growth
8447861 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
8447862 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
8447863 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
8447864 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
8447865 whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him
8447866 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous
8447867 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god
8447868 should i try again or is this just one of those pleasant his amp goodbyes
8447869 it would indeed be very nice if we could convert any one cell type into a different one
8447870 a very elegant and important contribution to the reprogramming field
8447871 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8447872 why did that veteran slide so far in our draft who got him anyway
8447873 exciting its my first convention and its great to be around so many people that are so enthusiastic our prospects of winning this fall and changing the direction of our country
8447874 certainly michele obamas speech was very moving especially when she was joined on stage by her daughters and then the video linked to obama
8447875 two i was really impressed about hillary speech especially when she talked about harriet tubman and her efforts on behalf of freed slaves and the underground railroad but i have to say my favorite speech at this point was remarks by montana gov brian schweitzer because he spoke the issue of energy policy and he focused on difference between sen obama and mccains plans as chairman of the energy and technology committee in the connecticut legislature i understood exactly what gov schweitzer was saying and how he said it
8447876 those are in no particular order insuring every american with decent quality affordable healthcare we also have to deal with climate change and global warming and creating energy independence we also have to deal with terrorism and restoring international relations and our standing in the world it seems to me that we cannot deal effectively with any of these challenges unless we embrace obamas call for meaningful change and a different way forward from where we are and have been for the past eight years
8447877 i think i would just like to say that the ct delegation gets along extremely well
8447878 you fall in love during the primaries but fall in line after
8447879 lot of speeches some are good and some are not so good its also interesting to see that you are part of something a lot bigger than just yourself or just connecticut
8447880 bike ride denver i saw that the city has made a lot of effort to be bike friendly and that speaks to the quality of life of the place
8447881 convention is part of the campaign campaign is about what kind of country we want to live what we want for ourselves our families and our neighbors and there are lots of ways to get involved in that campaign back home
8447882 i think we of two minds its been painful in some ways to see someone who is so much part of the democratic party for so many years to travel this different path i supposed like a lot of divorces there are different points of view on who left who at the end of the day its a reality of what his politics are right now its not unusual in politics that people finds themselves on different teams in different places its not because people change but because circumstances change what is important so someone when they are younger may be different than what is important to them when they are older
8447883 im all in favour of any democratic process that involves ratepayers and to have a community advisory board or committee is a good idea
8447884 but i would caution that if the sole purpose of this advisory board is to embark on a process of de amalgamation its just not going to happen and people basically are wasting their time because theyre missing the opportunity to influence how the council operates
8447885 i think shes been placed between a rock and a hard place in this whole process
8447886 she has a responsibility as a regional councillor to think of the whole region but shes also got responsibilities to her division
8447887 even top notch medical care cant compensate for the multiple effects of smoking on a developing baby first and foremost smoking cuts down a babys supply of oxygen a lack of oxygen hampers a fetuss growth and development setting the stage for low birth weight stillbirth miscarriage and many other potential complications
8447888 we dont like their sound and guitar music is on the way out
8447889 there wasnt anything that he was proposing that i disagree with
8447890 i think the act has been poorly served in the last four years at least by its current administration that theyve let canberra stagnate
8447891 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8447892 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8447893 support the actions of what i believe to be a failed administration and no longer desire to return to a position where i will again be forced to serve as a scapegoat for the inappropriate affairs and activities of others
8447894 believed that by working together we could have a positive impact on this city embracing all that it has to offer
8447895 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity

8447929 this speech will give him the opportunity to reach the biggest audience hes ever had
8447930 the hope is that after watching this speech people will know a little bit more about who barack obama is where he comes from and where he wants to take this country
8447931 he has great soaring rhetoric but as the substance has come out his numbers have started coming down
8447932 the media is setting lofty expectations but the reality is that obama has some hard work to do in explaining what he wants to accomplish
8447933 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment

8447935 his energy appeal to other young world leaders calm under pressure and openness to new thinking well served our nation
8447936 it was much like barack obama has done in many of his speeches and what i think hes going to do in denver
8447937 obama even though hes accomplished so much and arrived at this extraordinary position still has people out there who are not persuaded

8447946 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants

8447989 just what is so damning about obamas relationship with william ayers that he would threaten the free speech of others to prevent it from airing
8447990 i just dont think the label that i dont like foreigners applies im just saying it just feels like were held hostage and this is nutty
8447991 if they have enough money to do this then please could we expand it to the legal students and could we expand it to the other american citizens and the ugly truth i suspect is that we dont have the money and we just dont know what to do
8447992 getting an education is tougher for everyone these days because of the financial cost and fewer loans being available and in fact students of undocumented parents have very few financial options theyre not eligible for federal grants or loans nor grants from universities

8448072 pochi giorni fa siamo stati a casa di catherine hardwicke la regista per provare le nuove scene stato molto divertente

8448134 we cannot avoid bringing our culture to the church with us it is a part of our very being but in the light of tradition we need to sort out those cultural influences that contribute to the integrity of christian worship from those that detract from it
8448135 the fact is that we do many things in our culture that have pagan roots our accepted calendar the days of our week and the months of our year are named after pagan gods
8448136 it does not lead to the spiritual growth god intended

8448153 ketika anak itu masih hidup kita telah berbicara kepadanya tetapi ia tidak menghiraukan perkataan kita bagaimana kita dapat mengatakan kepadanya anak itu sudah mati jangan jangan ia mencelakakan diri

8448166 every single study you look up on wind turbines talks about the very serious issue of ice throw
8448167 a one kilogram piece of ice can be thrown a half mile from a turbine the size the school district is looking to build
8448168 blade flicker is another significant risk that has not been evaluated by the school district which is not an issue in rural areas where you generally see wind turbines
8448169 my client has spoken with a national property developer who is extremely interested in developing his site south of the school
8448170 they said we will not proceed with under any circumstances with the development if there is a turbine developers with national experience say its going to hurt property values in residential areas
8448171 we urge the city to create an ordinance that promotes the use of renewable energy sources and is consistent with its own sustainability objectives
8448172 a modern ordinance for a wind turbine in a suburban community does not exist but the city of woodbury has a unique opportunity to be a leader in minnesota in setting policies that will result in a more sustainable community
8448173 im thinking about safety issues and im thinking about aesthetics issues
8448174 when it comes to concerns about property value i can understand owners concerns in that regard but weve been here before with water towers and cell towers that dont generally win beauty awards
8448175 we look at those structures as providing a public good wind turbines in my view are the same as we move away from a fossil fuel based economy we need to think about how else are we going to do it we need to start thinking in our community about how can we plan to do that responsibly and appropriately
8448176 im very concerned about a wind turbine near my home because theyre ugly they make noise
8448177 at this point were not asking for a formal adoption of a new ordinance
8448178 weve got a lot of work do in this process its a big issue and it will take a while to develop a new ordinance if we decide an ordinance is something we want to pursue
8448179 the most difficult part of this whole thing is the eating every three hours sometimes i just plain dont want to eat
8448180 well you could always eat smaller things even a half or a quarter of a banana is still eating
8448181 i already make my portions smaller sometimes im just not hungry anyway and sometimes its a mental thing i dont want to see smell or even think about food
8448182 you could skip a meal spread the rest out a bit
8448183 i need to stick with what she says at least for the six weeks the whole point of eating so often is to steady out my blood sugar

8448190 the main bratz brand will always remain with mga and we are going full blast forward and nothing will stop us
8448191 the jury made a determination about damages but it didnt make a determination about the connection between the drawings and the damages
8448192 the stakes still remain very very high for mga theyre not out of the woods yet at all
8448193 the real prize is going to be can mattel convince the judge to grant an injunction that would prevent mga from ever producing another bratz product
8448194 we believe that the justice system will prevail and that our client will be found innocent

8448211 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
8448212 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport at approximately 2330 local french time
8448213 suddenly there was a roar of wind a rush of cold air the oxygen masks dropped you didnt know what was going on
8448214 no oxygen was delivered through the oxygen masks and i was surprised there seemed to be no communication between the pilot and the flight attendants because they didnt seem to know what to say and do
8448215 there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear
8448216 passengers sometimes misunderstand they expect a surge of oxygen when in actual fact there is a steady stream of oxygen
8448217 the oxygen masks were working and the correct procedures were followed

8448253 there were significantly more crabgrass weeds in the high temperature plots
8448254 some of the weeds including crabgrass are better adapted for higher temperatures than fescue the most common lawn grass because they use a different type of photosynthesis
8448255 our results suggest that these weeds may become more of a problem as the temperature gets warmer
8448256 warming may exacerbate weed invasions which may require more intensive management e g herbicide application to manage species composition

8448312 in particular personal income tax revenues continue to advance strongly
8448313 for every one per cent of economic growth weve seen a 1 6 per cent increase in revenues which is a little bit higher than historic trends and that is one of the reasons why the surplus has been so strong in recent years
8448314 theyve been getting a lot of unexpected cash from personal income tax revenues and a little bit from corporate tax revenues
8448315 the finance guys are being ever cautious and treating this as a blip
8448316 i dont think its going to go back to normal
8448317 the upward shift has occurred primarily because higher income earners who are taxed at higher marginal rates are capturing a larger share of national income
8448318 much the same process is at work on parts of business income tax revenue thanks to the commodity price boom
8448319 in turn this will create scope to pay down debt reduce taxes and or introduce targeted increases in spending

8448339 most company directors are blissfully unaware of the administrative or privileged passwords that their it guys have access to which allows them to see everything that is going on within the company these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as its often considered too much hassle
8448340 our advice is secure the most privileged data and routinely change and manage them so that if an employees contract is terminated whether sacked or made redundant they cant maliciously play havoc inside the network or vindictively steal data for competitive or financial gain

8448362 the biggest defense is to have any keys especially those used to authenticate to remote machines and certainly internet facing ones require a passphrase to use

8448370 i dont count fl and mi as victories for clinton
8448371 forever she will be able to make the argument that it is she who should have been nominated because she had the most delegates at the convention delegates who nevertheless supported obama
8448372 both morally superior and a victim at the same time sounds like a feminist to me
8448373 that is a strong proud competent woman who understood both the importance of having her name on the role call and understood the importance of bridging the two candidates into a full throated support for obama
8448374 the people who matter which is the democrats do not care about your fictional drama

8448378 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8448379 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8448380 right now the behavior focus is on saving money and getting more bang for the buck
8448381 there is a question of character temperament you need to be very careful about the people you choose

8448397 let your light shine that good deeds might be noticed
8448398 light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil
8448399 the lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you
8448400 no one whose hope is in you will ever be put to shame
8448401 thanks to all what are you up to today whens the next blog coming out whats it going to be about
8448402 im working on it now its about systems how traditional functional systems dont fit with the business process view of an organisation
8448403 really i was just in a meeting about that very subject we take a look from the business process perspective and it always spans lots of it systems the boundaries round processes are completely different to the demarcation between it systems so why are you doing that one
8448404 ive long held the view that operating in functional siloes is not the best way to extract business value and hinders the ability to achieve transparency another currently popular mantra in my view process solutions provide a better template for business
8448405 these assumptions also make plain that the enron inflicted blow on andersen was mortal the firms 2001 worldwide revenue was 9 3 billion it confronted plaintiffs lawyers claiming that the case would be the first against accountants to reach 1 billion the crippled firm was already dealing with claims involving baptist hospital waste management and sunbeam and it was about to receive the incoming bombardment of worldcom and qwest among others so to blame andersens death on the enron indictment misses the point the firm was like a terminal patient on late stage life support who happened to succumb to a fast moving staph infection its demise was imminent and inevitable
8448406 represents that a service organization has been through an in depth audit of their control objectives and control activities which often include controls over information technology and related processes

8448408 over the weekend i had a conversation with dennis howlett and francine mckenna about whether auditors are keeping up with newer issues coming up with saas and cloud computing are the sas 70 audits keeping up with unique multi tenancy virtualization shared across customer asset issues
8448409 sas70 issues are not getting resolved in the world of saas multi tenancy and virtualized shared compute resources
8448410 which parts of the business will be directly affected should this it system or part thereof fail
8448411 what would be the financial impact should an it system or component thereof fail
8448412 which parts of the business will be indirectly affected should this it asset fail
8448413 hey miss do you need help or what we dont have all day
8448414 mommy millie certainly heard him and she even told the guy that
8448415 you know what sir you too have a mother or grandmother im sure i just hope she wont ever get disrespected or treated horribly like you did to this lady
8448416 we appreciate hall of fame racing helping us get joey ready for 2009
8448417 they came to us with the idea before the august michigan race and we think its a great win win for all of us

8448425 we do not accept that israel can stop these boats palestinians have the same rights as all other peoples why is it that the only people in the mediterranean without access to their own waters are the palestinians
8448426 cryotherapy is a significant alternative to traditional treatments for prostate cancer such as radical prostatectomy and external beam radiation treatment patient satisfaction with cryotherapy is high due to its minimally invasive approach which allows returning to active life quicker than with alternative treatments
8448427 our findings suggest that anti pc can be used as a complement to the traditional risk factors to improve diagnosis and treatment in addition we are currently developing anti pc as a vaccine for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease
8448428 we are very pleased with the final results of the double blind clinical trial and are excited to have our first revenue producing molecular diagnostic test ready for commercialization
8448429 we are very impressed with the results from these validation studies and i applaud the development teams from both clarient and hdc for their diligent efforts in bringing this new test through the validation phase significantly ahead of schedule the early results from these studies confirm our belief that this powerful genomics based test may provide physicians with useful information to ensure that men with prostate cancer get a more accurate diagnosis sooner and minimize the need for unnecessary biopsies
8448430 in a lot of fields there can be significant scientific advances made using microfluidic devices and i think that has been hindered because it does take some degree of skill and equipment to make these devices
8448431 this new system is almost like lego blocks you dont need any fabrication skills to put them together
8448432 thirty or 40 years ago computing was done on large scale systems now everyone has many computers on their person in their house its my vision that in another few decades youll see this trend in microfluidics
8448433 youll be analyzing chicken to see if it has salmonella youll be analyzing yourself to see if you have influenza or analyzing the air to see if it has noxious elements in it
8448434 we are excited to team up with philips a company with a globally recognized consumer brand and a commitment to offer consumers advanced easy to use products
8448435 this exclusive partnership will allow us to leverage reliants unique fractional laser technology and enter the growing home use aesthetic market with innovative products that use the philips and fraxel brands
8448436 the partnership with philips continues the strong reliant tradition of research and development that results in safe and effective products that fit our patients lifestyles whether in a physicians office or in the home
8448437 development of a home use device will complement the current portfolio of fraxel laser systems by allowing consumers an introduction to fraxel treatments and by offering a convenient touch up solution between professional fraxel treatments
8448438 this acquisition is consistent with ges strategy to invest in high technology innovative businesses that deliver top line growth earnings expansion and expanded margins
8448439 vital signs has consistently grown at double digit rates while generating strong operating margins its products are a great complement to our existing anaesthesia monitoring and respiratory offerings
8448440 its a precious moment when a child comes out of surgery with a new smile so you dont want to miss it and you want to get it right
8448441 we are so grateful to sony electronics for this significant financial support and commitment to our cause
8448442 with this relationship sony is not only helping operation smile provide new smiles to children born with facial deformities but with their donation of cameras they are also helping us capture images of these priceless moments during our medical missions
8448443 even though we are succeeding in preventing organ rejection we haven t made much progress to improve long term survival
8448444 unfortunately most kidney transplant patients will go back on dialysis in eight to ten years in part because the anti rejection drugs can be toxic to the kidneys
8448445 successful low dose regimens of tacrolimus and other anti rejection medications require highly precise ultra sensitive drug monitoring assays
8448446 at low doses even the slightest variation in blood level readings could be devastating to transplant patients the consequence for the laboratory is twofold it must have accurate precise testing for immunosuppressive drugs and tacrolimus tests that are accurate to 4 ng ml are no longer adequate
8448447 the challenge for the laboratory therefore is to assure with the utmost confidence to the physician that a tacrolimus blood level of 3 ng ml is exactly right and not 5
8448448 the functional sensitivity in our hands was 0 9 ng ml exceeding the package insert claim of 2 ng ml we are fully confident the architect tacrolimus assay meets our requirement for low level tacrolimus monitoring
8448449 the architect tacrolimus assay is the only automated transplant monitoring test that meets international standards for low level monitoring
8448450 with its patented features and unique capabilities we believe flochannel is a significant advance in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders and may become an invaluable tool in attended sleep laboratories
8448451 we have simplified remote follow ups to the extent that they are now something that can be performed seamlessly without interrupting the patients day patients simply set up the merlin home transmitter after that the system handles all aspects of patient follow up including daily monitoring
8448452 the simplicity of the system reduces the chance of patients missing follow up transmissions
8448453 by directly alerting physicians the merlin home transmitter and merlin net pcn can help reduce risks associated with cardiac episodes that physicians would want to know about right away
8448454 without this notification these events might go undetected for significant amounts of time direct notification is one more way to give physicians more control over their patients critical health care
8448455 we are very excited about this acquisition because we see a strong potential for revenue growth using bruker axs global distribution capabilities being part of the international bruker axs organization will enable us to grow our customer base around the globe and offer our existing customers enhanced applications support and service capabilities for our innovative high quality afm products
8448456 in 2005 the previous commonwealth government agreed to include the public interest monitor in the application process for preventative detention orders under its terrorism legislation
8448457 but it would not agree to our request to amend commonwealth legislation to include the public interest monitor in the case of phone tap warrant applications
8448458 this is about striking the right balance between important police activities and very legitimate privacy concerns of our citizens
8448459 i thank the prime minister for working with the queensland government to secure an outcome that protects our citizens this is collaborative federalism at work
8448460 every other state in australia has telephone interception powers but queenslands labor government has deliberately resisted for 10 years
8448461 the lnp has maintained its support for telephone interception powers and twice introduced the relevant legislation for it to happen
8448462 both times the beattie bligh government have voted down the legislation denying our states law enforcement officers the valuable resource they deserve
8448463 eu acho que o campeonato ainda tem muita coisa para acontecer vai subir muita gente e descer muita gente temos que fazer o nosso dever de casa e buscar pontos fora com mais duas vit rias estaremos definitivamente na briga
8448464 em 2007 foi assim engrenamos uma seq ncia de vit rias e conseguimos nos classificar para as finais vamos trabalhar porque temos condi es de fazer isso acontecer novamente
8448465 o diferencial que a equipe vem com humildade comendo muito pelas beradas a manuten o deve ser da mesma maneira poucos colocaram o santo andr como um dos favoritos e assim que estamos chegando
8448466 todo o campeonato equilibrado s o corinthians ficou no g 4 por muito tempo n o d para definir o que vai acontecer sabemos que dif cil se manter em cima quatro ou cinco times fora do g 4 podem chegar ent o temos que ficar atentos
8448467 today is life the only life you are sure of make the most of today get interested in something shake yourself awake develop a hobby let the winds of enthusiasm sweep through you live today with gusto

8448470 they say im crazy but i have a good time im just looking for clues at the scene of the crime lifes been good to me so far
8448471 life loves to be taken by the lapel and told im with you kid lets go maya angelou
8448472 thomas jefferson once said we should never judge a president by his age only by his works and ever since he told me that i stopped worrying
8448473 larrabee hasnt shipped so you dont know what it is and i dont know what it is
8448474 by the time it does ship nvidias technology will be so far advanced it wont matter
8448475 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
8448476 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
8448477 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
8448478 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
8448479 heres what you can do so no one gets pregnant but you can still get some sexual kicks

8448482 interviews with several muslims reveal a mixed view on additional marriages under islamic law some said it is not allowed under united states law and therefore is forbidden others said it can be permissible under islamic law anyway we have seen this
8448483 principal of islamic school in buffalo ousted over sex allegations
8448484 i want families to know these people are not following islamic laws they are not following american laws they claim they are serving islam but they are just serving themselves
8448485 in our culture we dont even let girls sit with their male cousins and this guy is a teacher why is this man who has said we are not even allowed to chat with a boy doing this
8448486 often said women were on earth only to satisfy men
8448487 the woman no longer believes she was married to memon and is bitter toward the school and its teachings

8448494 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8448495 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8448496 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8448497 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8448498 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8448499 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8448500 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8448501 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the
8448502 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8448503 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8448504 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8448505 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8448506 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8448507 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8448508 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8448509 the home testing market has significantly expanded in recent years as more consumers seek to control their healthcare costs
8448510 this is a natural area of opportunity for us as we operate one of the most efficient high quality labs in the country that is also an fda approved manufacturer of collection kits
8448511 sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the united states particularly alarming is that it disproportionately affects african americans
8448512 disparities in care for patients that are at risk for sca as indicated in the rates found among african american women are unacceptable
8448513 our goal is to raise awareness of the risk of sca and galvanize healthcare professionals researchers patient advocates policy makers and payors into action to reduce disparities in both primary and secondary prevention of the disease
8448514 the anti ageing protocol originated from a totally unexpected finding in our scientific study cr diets are known to greatly extend the life spans of mammals including humans such as those in okinawa japan
8448515 our experiments with rodents found that after a short period of cr dieting the animals could be allowed to feed freely and still show extended life if their food was supplemented with ala what was equally surprising was that a prolonged anti obesity effect also occurred these observations provide exciting opportunities for anyone who wants a longer healthier life
8448516 memang tidak sedemikian sakitnya untuk meneruskan pertandingan itu tapi saya berharap bisa pulih
8448517 saya sempat tidak benar benar ingin bermain tenis tak mau mempersiapkan diri untuk mengikuti turnamen turnamen itu sebabnya saya tidak main bagus di toronto dan cincinnati
8448518 itu pula sebabnya saya berusaha untuk balik lagi ada beberapa turnamen sebelum musim ini berakhir dan sangatlah penting buat saya bermain bagus di sini apalagi ini turnamen grand slam terakhir di tahun ini
8448519 ada kebersamaan dan fokus itulah yang kami mau setelah menelan sebuah hasil seperti sabtu lalu ketika kami kalah di fulham
8448520 kami harus terorganisir karena mereka cukup menguji kesabaran kami kami bermain disiplin dan fokus dan kami tak pernah menghadapi tekanan berarti

8448523 we can confirm that on 21 august a single hotel in germany was compromised by a virus the compromise permitted access to reservations data for that property only
8448524 this has affected only ten customers who are currently being contacted to offer our assistance none of these were gb customers there is no evidence of any unauthorised access to any other customer data
8448525 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8448526 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8448527 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8448528 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8448529 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8448530 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8448531 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a and an international
8448532 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8448533 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8448534 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8448535 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that here
8448536 the pioneering work in rnai delivery by the scientists at mirus together with our centre of excellence for rnai research in kulmbach puts roche at the forefront of bringing this whole new class of treatment to patients who suffer from difficult to treat diseases
8448537 our global research team has made great strides in advancing rnai therapeutics and with our new colleagues in madison we will now bolster those efforts the technology brought by mirus together with additional technologies will bring us closer to creating fully enabled rnai therapeutics
8448538 the expertise resources and commitment that roche brings to the rnai field make roche an ideal partner for mirus
8448539 together we will be able to greatly accelerate the progress we would have accomplished independently
8448540 in russia as everywhere else there is capitalism it is stupid to think that the latter can exist without being defended by a government even if in russia this government is referred to as proletarian
8448541 the priests and sergeants major be expelled from schools and universities and taxes abolished
8448542 situated between hammer and anvil they courageously fought against fascism and paid dearly for it
8448543 sterile and ineffective unable to respond to the goals and the immediate tasks and to the interests of the workers

8448546 if you want to be an nfl football player this is your chance
8448547 you get ready to play and you go out there and play and show us you can play and help our team
8448548 i want to have those guys walk out of here and say hey i had the opportunity because thats what im telling them
8448549 when you do that and then dont let them play i dont think its fair and its not fair to our team either because some of them can play
8448550 why all of the passing why not just let x player take over theyre taking too long to take a shot dont listen to the coach son listen to me i know better
8448551 wallets and waists are getting thinner as consumers tighten their belts and prioritise what they spend their dwindling disposable income on
8448552 footfall will drop for restaurants across the uk but spend per head should be less affected
8448553 lower socio demographic groups are more likely to stop eating out altogether and families with high mortgage repayments will also be reluctant to eat out
8448554 there is a wider range of restaurants this time around and much wider choice of casual dining options for consumers eating out used to be a more formal three course meal but is now a habit for many consumers enjoying affordable choice
8448555 the credit crunch will not change the course of this cultural behaviour
8448556 the challenge for restaurants is to try and keep the same customers through promotions discounts and good set menus but more importantly through excellent customer service
8448557 customers need to walk away with more than a full stomach they will be looking for a good experience that provides value for money if they are dropping visits patrons must make sure they drop them from other restaurants
8448558 acmas draft standards are informed by a significant body of commissioned research review and analysis of available data detailed economic modelling and its consideration of public submissions
8448559 the draft standards are designed to ensure that australian children continue to be catered for in free to air television programming and to protect children from material that may be harmful to them this is a particularly important high profile issue and we would expect and welcome robust commentary
8448560 acma is not a health advisory body therefore in assessing whether or not a ban on food and beverage advertising would have an impact on childhood obesity acma commissioned an independent review of research on the issue
8448561 childhood obesity is a highly complex issue and the review found that there was not a sufficient consensus on the impact of banning food and beverage advertising on obesity levels
8448562 however existing research does not clearly demonstrate a causal relationship between any of these factors and obesity indeed only a modest association is apparent acma has formed the view that restricting food and beverage advertising particularly without a tool to identify high fat salt sugar hfss products would be a blunt form of regulatory intervention with significant cost to the commercial television sector and uncertain national benefits such restrictions would also prevent healthy food and beverage products from being advertised
8448563 whilst a well informed debate about the potential impact of food advertising during childrens programming is important evidence to support advertising bans as a solution to childhood obesity does not stack up acmas report reflects this
8448564 childhood obesity is not unique to australia and governments around the world that have tried to restrict advertising to children have found that it does little to solve the problem
8448565 the food industry is responding positively to public health concerns regarding childhood obesity by working with government and other stakeholders to promote a balanced approach to nutrition
8448566 three out of every four food ads on childrens tv now promote junk foods or drinks its increased from two out of three food ads in two years
8448567 and its abundantly clear that fast food chains confectionery and soft drink companies target our children through television
8448568 the proposed silver bullet solution of a blanket ban on advertising offered up by some state governments and consumer groups is an over simplistic approach to the very serious issue of childhood obesity
8448569 the reality is that the important issue of childhood obesity requires a multi pronged public health approach in which government industry and other stakeholders work together to achieve good health outcomes for our children

8448602 this goes much further than pat ford pittsburgh is no longer a city that is open for business pittsburgh is a city for sale
8448603 while predictable this most recent ravenstahl administration personnel incident is disturbing and calls for further investigation before mayor oconnors death luke ravenstahl had no management experience and it shows i am worried the continuing personnel drama surrounding this administration will negatively impact the lives of pittsburghs citizens

8448615 what can i do about it apart from win games and keep going
8448616 ive had this now for a little while ill get on with it im a big boy as ive said before
8448617 the disappointing thing is the players are the ones that have to go out and perform the fans are brilliant when they are behind us and they have to realise the effect it has when they are not behind us football is a bit like this you go through periods like this it has happened to other managers and happened a bit last year
8448618 the only thing that is unfair is that we stayed up and finished tenth with all sorts of problems
8448619 i understand the responsibility of being west ham manager ive watched games at upton park and other managers here have had similar criticism its part and parcel that fans let you know when they are not happy
8448620 the young lads pulled us out of it they came on with fresh legs and fresh minds and i was pleased with them getting their goals
8448621 insite is an abomination and you can put that on youtube
8448622 do you know what that is watching someone die slowly
8448623 sticking a needle in your veins is not harm reduction
8448624 were proof zero tolerance works because weve survived harm minimisation
8448625 one illustration of this is the fact that injecting drug use and related harms such as hiv and hepatitis c infection are entirely omitted from the states report to the committee as are any references to measures taken to address drug use and reduce drug related harms
8448626 there were twenty four new cases of hiv among injecting drug users in stockholm in the first half of 2007 compared with zero in sk ne where the needle exchange programmes operate

8448672 romney is the greatest thing that has happened to the gop for 100 years
8448673 its statements like this that make us non rombots think you guys are a little nuts
8448674 now theres this really big push for modest clothing and so youre seeing new websites springing up and these young designers coming out trying to cater to this market
8448675 i think also there has been this trend in fashion of really over sexualizing clothing for young women that maybe wasnt as prevalent 20 years ago i dont remember seeing anyone with a bare midriff 20 years ago
8448676 because they all have different ideas about what modesty requires of them
8448677 some of them are not going to wear a head scarf or a robe for example
8448678 some girls are looking for clothes that will have a high neckline full sleeves and either trousers or skirts that go down to the ankle when youre looking to dress in that kind of vein its much more difficult
8448679 we hear from readers all the time asking for websites asking for stores where they can shop asking for products they estimate that the muslim population in the united states is between six to eight million so thats a huge underserved market if people were to design clothes for them i think that theyd be really quick to snap them up
8448680 the big demand here is for clothing that looks like everybody elses clothing but isnt as skin baring
8448681 you had these big puffy flared skirts that dont trace the shape of the body so that suited a lot of girls
8448682 everybody wanted to wear those fabrics but wed say here you wear it with two or three different shirts well show you the look and then you can still be as contemporary as any other girl but youre also meeting your own requirements of being modest so layering takes care of those things like gaps in your neckline and short sleeves
8448683 mental health outcomes were not assessed by mental health professionals or standardized surveys but rather by reports to general practitioners
8448684 well over half of the women dropped out of the study and were not available for follow up
8448685 what the committee has in effect said is that until there is compelling evidence to the contrary people should act as though abortion has no harmful effects this is not a defensible position in a situation in which there is evidence pointing in the direction of harmful effects the moral of all of this is very simple in science drawing strong conclusions on the basis of weak evidence is bad practice the apa report on abortion and mental health falls into this error
8448686 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8448687 you will never know which parts of the internet youll need
8448688 because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8448689 each language expresses the history culture society and identity of the people who speak it and each is a unique way of talking about the world
8448690 and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech
8448691 ket is the only siberian language with a tone system where the pitch of the voice can give what sound like identical words quite different meanings
8448692 the biggest defense is to have any keys especially those used to authenticate to remote machines and certainly internet facing ones require a passphrase to use
8448693 check your logs especially if you use ssh key based auth to identify accesses from remote machines that have no business accessing you
8448694 this is a frightening revelation of the thinking that motivates michelle and barack
8448695 barack obama says he will work to overturn the defense of marriage act which protects states from having to recognize homosexual marriages but also says he thinks marriage is a union of one man and one woman
8448696 i realized what position they were in when i had to go through it myself i never imagined putting somebody in shoes like that that ive actually caused someone to be scared or threatened for their life or their families
8448697 they could have let bobby go on probation take care of his family he have a family to raise what he did was wrong everybody makes mistakes
8448698 its scary and it changes your life when someone tells you theyre going to kill you and you dont know who it is it makes you think and look over your shoulder every second
8448699 plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence at this stage for their allegations of serious abuse

8448707 i had seen mark not all that long ago in newtown he looked really happy and he was eating at my favourite pasta bar

8448715 a bad episode of 24 he has also commented about how fox went and cut the movies production budget and removing 15 minutes of the films length consisting mostly of dialogue points
8448716 last night we went to sleep beside each other as we have for the last twelve years
8448717 as far as i know he hasnt read the book
8448718 he told me he didnt want to i tried to show some of the really good parts of him like his desire to be a good father i did not have any desire to write a story in which he was the villain i wanted to write about my experience with divorce and how i got through the first couple of years
8448719 one of my daughters would like to read it right now
8448720 its definitely an issue ive asked her to wait and im trusting her that she will there are multiple copies in the house and shes thirteen so it is a matter of trust someday she will read the book and i have to have faith that she will be able to tolerate the knowledge that her mother is human
8448721 to restore americas standing to what it was eight years ago
8448722 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8448723 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8448724 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8448725 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8448726 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8448727 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8448728 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8448729 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms

8448731 the definition of adulthood is that you want to sleep
8448732 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
8448733 we affirm the priesthood of all believers laypersons have the same right as ordained ministers to communicate with god interpret scripture and minister in christs name that is why the convention requires strong lay involvement on its boards this doctrine is first and foremost a matter of responsibility and servanthood not privilege and license
8448734 you also like living stones are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation a people belonging to god that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light

8448752 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8448753 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8448754 there are certainly more obese people than their need be
8448755 but i dont see any more fat people walking around here than i would when i visit aberdeen
8448756 the rates of obesity in england are very worrying as an obese patient is highly likely to impair their longevity and quality of life
8448757 there is convincing scientific evidence that excess body fat increases risk of six types of cancer including post menopausal breast cancer and bowel cancer

8448769 hillary will do everything to get barack obama elected and i will do everything in my power to get barack obama elected big pause and 18 million of you will help get him elected too
8448770 barack has the remarkable ability to rally people to high hopes
8448771 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8448772 people around the world have always been more impessed with the power of our example than the example of our power
8448773 in this case the third time is not the charm
8448774 if like me you believe that america should be a place called hope then elect barack obama
8448775 it is possible to be disappointed and think that it was time for a woman to be president and still work hard for obama
8448776 senator clinton has been moving us through the steps to support obama she is a real leader she is bringing us together to support obama he is very lucky that she was his opponent
8448777 the media likes conflict a victory by john mccain would go against everything hillary clinton has fought for her entire life

8448782 a lot of jewish democrats are saying theyre not going to vote
8448783 a lot of these people dont know enough about him
8448784 obama needs to come down and get in to some of these older communities
8448785 when the future of the jewish people is at stake you want to be really careful
8448786 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
8448787 when i was a little boy i went to eastern europe with my father and we were met everywhere by hundreds of thousands of people
8448788 and that wasnt just reserved for democrats when president dwight eisenhower went to iran muslims went out in millions to see him
8448789 and they named their streets after our leaders washington jefferson lincoln and so many others
8448790 when i was a little kid we and the soviets had nukes aimed at each other
8448791 but we didnt torture people we didnt suspend habeas corpus and we didnt bug 300 000 people
8448792 to show the world that we went down the wrong path with bush
8448793 he brought up some very salient points regarding the failures of the current administration
8448794 however you have to emphasize that we are still a great nation we just need to move away from an ideology that has taken our country away from what it means to be an american
8448795 he sang another song before they called me in but they only aired the silly song we sang together this could affect his career
8448796 ten has a long association with vesna and we have the utmost respect for her
8448797 i believe that caracas will become a first world city in 20 years i have a very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally which i will be calling on to assist in this
8448798 it depends to what extent we will be tapping into our individual resources the whole cost of this trip has been paid for by the government of venezuela and as an unemployed citizen i would not be able to pay for my own fare otherwise
8448799 we have discussed with the candidates a programme they will take forward after the november elections
8448800 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses
8448801 as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities
8448802 the reality is that this management and this board have failed investors and failed their public mission
8448803 why should we have great confidence that they have finally made the right choice after stumbling
8448804 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8448805 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8448806 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8448807 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8448808 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8448809 it was so super comfy and i was so super huge it was like the only thing that fit
8448810 the small explosion revealed a fruity creation that required the precision of a surgeon conducting a circumsion to cut
8448811 just one more cut honey amp that mean ol alien will be dead
8448812 i am so glad that i finally convinced my parents to get married

8448884 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8448885 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8448886 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8448887 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8448888 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8448889 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8448912 duplicated source code can be an indicator for quality problems
8448913 having the same algorithm spread across the whole application in slightly different variations will lead to increased maintenance effort which ultimately may result in inconsistencies
8448914 clone detective makes it easy for developers to perform a clone detection and visualize the existing clones however in some cases the source duplication cannot be easily removed e g the cost of removing the clones outweighs the costs of keeping them due to heavy design change requirements
8448915 in this case clone detective helps by reminding you that a given portion of code is duplicated by a purple bar in the code editor so if you make changes to it you should review the other occurrences and make sure you keep your application consistent
8448916 fuzzy clones are clones that are almost identical but not token by token this will allow you to find existing inconsistencies in your code base

8448994 pain after surgery continues to be a problem because many of the commonly used drugs are either ineffective or have too many side effects these results show that cannabinoids are effective and may lead to the development of a wider range of drugs to manage postoperative pain

8449004 russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8449005 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8449006 we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by president sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8449007 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8449008 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war

8449018 we cannot afford to simply cut and run in iraq

8449020 giving peace a chance only gives saddam hussein more time to prepare for war on his terms at a time of his choosing in pursuit of ambitions that will only grow as his power to achieve them grows
8449021 i came to see all the vendors to see if i want to book any of them for my wedding

8449023 the lake superior theatre of course because this is their home
8449024 and then the ymca of marquette county because they have a program called fit to be wed and we thought it would be appropriate that the strong kids fund could benefit from any donations people would care to share with us
8449025 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers

8449030 like other organizations we are feeling the economic pinch this year and are really looking to the community to help make this auction a tremendous success for our students
8449031 we can tell that theres a real economic change this year we dont have as much from merchants
8449032 this auction is important because without it we arent able to keep up with current technology and provide our teachers and students with the exceptional equipment that theyve come to rely on to meet their educational needs
8449033 but not as deceitful as a low down dirty deceiver
8449034 ebay has often talked about the changes taking place in the marketplace and the younger demographic thats now using our website
8449035 we thought lets check in with some younger people give them a completely clean slate and see what they come up with in this way we could see what we need to do to address the needs of that audience
8449036 when we heard that saratoga high school had 21 students interested we were really excited
8449037 we knew students who were involved in the media arts had a whole host of skills and were looking for multimedia projects to work on
8449038 we came up with a list of students who might be interested and ended up with three great teams
8449039 ebay doesnt decide what the user wants the community does that
8449040 this is a great example of that interaction we got some wonderful suggestions with all of these designs
8449041 the use of fonts and graphics was fun and also very practical
8449042 their presentation was very well done thoroughly rehearsed and suggested elements that arent currently a part of our site

8449057 and asking consumers to spend a premium on a green product is the most hassle filled commitment at all
8449058 ive seen how we can make some changes through the appropriations process
8449059 this bill is an attempt for us to address issues you face on a daily basis
8449060 it is difficult to come forward and say you need help but were perfectly set up with people who can counsel and help you
8449061 if you support this bill you need to have folks keep on top of us to make sure this passes
8449062 we want a national standard of excellence and performance for our students
8449063 we are trying to fill in the gaps so there isnt any leakage when we need to come together
8449064 the answer is to have congress put together bills to address how we can give people more choices on energy
8449065 if we do that home by home well start to impact our carbon footprint
8449066 we need to spend time on research for energy thats cleaner
8449067 when we can move big corporations through grassroots well see some big more permanent changes
8449068 a child growing up today needs to learn about their impact on the carbon footprint

8449088 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8449089 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8449090 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8449091 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance

8449101 more often than not roi felt the music in the episcopal church left a lot to be desired roi knew where his heart was and it was on the score that was written for him by his god
8449102 death is just the beginning the beginning of life in christ
8449103 hed be sitting in this chair sleeping it must have been a comfortable chair while were discussing something and hed wake up and say i think that and explain what he thought
8449104 he was so good at telling stories he could have made a living at it although it would have been less lucrative
8449105 he had this sort of explosive laugh that would just come out of him and it came from deep inside and you couldnt help but laugh along with him
8449106 we want to make our nation a place where everyone gets a shot regardless of race gender or sexual orientation
8449107 you in this room are setting the tone for everything were doing this week
8449108 its been five years since lawrence v texas and 39 since stonewall and weve still got work to do before we achieve equality
8449109 we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and we have to close those gaps until the world as it is and the world as it should be are one and the same
8449110 discrimination has no place in a nation founded on the promise of equality
8449111 you at the beginning o lord laid the foundations of the earth itself and the heavens are the works of your hands 11 they themselves will perish but you yourself are to remain continually and just like an outer garment they will all grow old 12 and you will wrap them up just as a cloak as an outer garment and they will be changed but you are the same and your years will never run out

8449113 oh shannon is drunk right now so she must be drinking with kyle
8449114 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8449115 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8449116 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8449117 theres no doubt in my mind that we will prevail and theres no doubt in my mind once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
8449118 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8449119 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8449120 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
8449121 twilight was about finding true love new moon was loosing true love and eclipse was choosing true love
8449122 in the first six months of 2008 we reported healthy growth in revenue and profitability despite a weakening global economy
8449123 with a slowing global economy high commodity prices and policies by the chinese government towards the export manufacturing sector we are beginning to feel the impact on our customers businesses as well as on our own
8449124 despite the impact the current climate is having on gold supplier members in our international marketplace our china marketplace grew very quickly in the first half of 2008 this growth is a result of efforts taken over the past few years to expand the network effect of our marketplace and maintain high customer satisfaction levels which are bearing fruit in the face of a strong domestic economy going forward we expect the robust growth of our china marketplace to continue the recent launches of a series of new products and services including winport china trustpass for individuals and export to china will further expand our china marketplace and we are encouraged by the positive response these initiatives have received so far

8449127 these discussions will have no impact on the on going management of bbm in the normal course of business nor on bbms ownership of either eircom or golden pages
8449128 although the independent directors are hopeful that the discussions will lead to agreement with babcock amp brown concerning the future management of bbc they are not in a position to provide any assurance that this will be the outcome of the discussions
8449129 the board believes that it is not appropriate to proceed with the buy back whilst these discussions are ongoing
8449130 the board did not take the decision to defer the off market buyback lightly
8449131 the board needs to consider the impact an internalisation of management proposal might have the board believes that shareholders should know the outcome of the discussions with babcock amp brown before having to decide whether they will participate in the off market buyback
8449132 babcock amp brown is committed to having both listed and unlisted managed funds in areas of core focus
8449133 saya kira biar bank yang menentukan kalau terlalu tinggi kurang baik tapi kalau tidak disesuaikan likuiditas ya macet

8449135 kondisi likuiditas suatu negara dalam lingkup globalisasi ini tergantung dari masing masing termasuk aliran modal yang keluar masuk dan sekarang ini banyak likuiditas yang keluar masuk tapi kalau keluar akan makin ketat ini tergantung pada situasi finansial global jadi kita tidak bisa lepas dari hal semacam itu kita harus waspadai kita jangan lalu melawan arus terlalu banyak dengan perkembangan global

8449157 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8449158 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8449159 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8449160 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8449161 honoring the past but living in the present is important
8449162 i would hire myself to work for food doing whatever i could on the farms
8449163 there were no men around the area because of the war
8449164 i would make a pot out of parts of tin cans the germans had discarded but was always afraid to use a big fire in case i would be discovered
8449165 i felt i had a drive to survive it was almost like a game to prove i could outsmart the soldiers and their dogs
8449166 i learned that no matter what anyone does to you or what your circumstances are you can survive if you have the bigger goal in mind that was something that always kept me going that ability to think ahead is something that was there all my life
8449167 the pavement is made out of gold in america i kept on hearing during the war
8449168 i still look down at the pavement today and see no gold but at least i know i can make it
8449169 i always had it in my mind that i would be able to be successful and get to the top i had a vision of what i was supposed to be doing
8449170 theyre louder more powerful and definitely more efficient than any other sub weve designed these subs are pinnacle of home audio
8449171 if you screw things up in tennis its 15 love if you screw up in boxing its your ass
8449172 i am very grateful to be here today i want to clear up one thing i am the true heavyweight champion
8449173 i have fought 31 fights and never ducked anyone i fought with my eardrum broken and lost 25 pounds that night but i still fought
8449174 i am making one promise today i will knock vitali out trust me i will knock out vitali and then i will beat his brother ibf wbo heavyweight champion wladimir klitschko there is no doubt about that
8449175 thank you to everyone who put energy into making this fight happen
8449176 i am pleased to say that i am back i am happy to be back in the ring happy to fight for my title i gave away my title freely because of my knee injury
8449177 i feel sorry for peter that i must fight him skeptical people say that i wont win because i have been out of the ring for three years but i did not lose the title i am honored to fight for wbc president jos sulaim n who gave me this chance
8449178 i have big respect for mr lou duva but his fighters always say they will knock me out and it never happens mr duva is preparing peter to knock me out but this will never happen
8449179 i dont underestimate peter he is a good puncher i will give my best to be the winner to take my title back and to make history where two brothers will be champions at the same time its a huge motivation for me
8449180 i promise the fight will not be easy and it wont go to the scorecards it will probably end between rounds four six i have a lot of presents ready for peter for october 11
8449181 this fight was a fight that a lot of people never thought would happen
8449182 we are so happy to work with showtime showtime is pound for pound the best network in boxing we are proud to have this fight on showtime
8449183 this will be a great fight between two great punchers i doubt however that this fight goes 12 rounds
8449184 we are looking to see where we are and where we need to get better
8449185 we have a young team with three freshmen and a number of players who havent played quality minutes or are coming back from injury they need to get a look and gain a feel for what were trying to do perhaps most importantly we need to change our personality as a team as we look toward october and preseason practice
8449186 i think both the practices in preparation for the trip and the games we will play are important but i think the practices are supremely important
8449187 there are roles that we want to try and define whos going to play this position or that position i dont think well answer all of those questions but well start to take a real hard look at what thats going to look like
8449188 the practice sessions have been good i dont have a problem at all with how hard theyve worked with what weve asked them to do i think its been a little slow transitioning ourselves mentally to injecting ones personality or personalities on this team so we start to look drastically different than we did last year because we are different
8449189 theyll have a great opportunity and well throw them in there
8449190 because they werent here last year and they missed several days of practice theyre behind a little which is to be expected well try to do a good job of getting them caught up but they wont be completely caught up from a cardio standpoint or a knowledge standpoint well just throw them in the water and see if they can swim
8449191 the veterans as well as our newcomers are well deserving of this championship a lot of hard work has gone into reaching this goal
8449192 i love the hopes and dreams this league brings to young girls across the world
8449193 i tell our team all the time that they will always be remembered as the foundation of this incredible dream
8449194 a c ashley carlson did not order a senior ring in hopes of getting a big south ring but she will now get a world championship ring
8449195 it was great to see how a team with several new faces can come together in such a short time and work together and win a championship
8449196 it was neat to play with and learn from players who come from different successful programs around the country it was truly a great experience

8449244 we are going to talk to him later this week just to get an update from him but right now we are not putting any pressure on him because he has to get that feeling that he wants to play
8449245 its not something thats preferable even to him mats has said in the past its not something he is totally comfortable with but at the same time you cant say that until youre in that position yourself niedermayer went through this and needed time and perhaps mats is in the same situation
8449246 its difficult to react to speculation and im not going to
8449247 i think that our position has been pretty clear we made a significant offer and we are prepared to be patient nothing much has happened in the hockey world over the past 30 days and on a moving forward basis we are going to try and remain as patient as we can
8449248 i didnt anticipate it taking this long but this isnt a simple situation its more complicated than most and we have to accept that
8449249 we have prevented her from looking at the comments that have been posted on her website there are many people who have attacked her and the family for being fake and having no sense of shame
8449250 im worried that she does understand a little of this my greatest worry is that when she starts school after the summer holidays all her school friends will ask about it and it will break miaokes young heart
8449251 she is a beautiful singer but her voice is soft i dont know exactly what happened
8449252 we needed to transform what had become a broken holding company in the late 90s into an integrated operating company

8449261 is having a final meeting on the vice presidential issue its not entirely clear whether it is to go through the choices again and reach a final decision or whether it is for mccain to inform his inner circle of his choice in any event it looks like the decision will be set in stone today
8449262 many of you feel a responsibility to the voters in your state others want the choice to vote whats in your heart i am not telling you what to do
8449263 long shot prospect for vice president is getting a push from conservative and other pundits in the lead up to next weeks republican national convention
8449264 reports of strong support within john mccains presidential campaign for independent democratic sen joseph lieberman as the republican candidate for vice president are not a fairy tale influential mccain backers plus mccain himself would pick the pro choice liberal from connecticut if they thought they could get away with it
8449265 but they cant get away with it and this has been made clear to mccain by none other than joe lieberman himself
8449266 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8449267 for all of barack obamas eloquence for all of the quiet confidence of michelle obama it may well be bidens own star turn on wednesday night that provides the mile high lift to the democratic prospects in november
8449268 biden is the only big name speaker whose primary mission is to pin the tail on john mccain all signs including guidance from the obama and biden camps suggest that the six term delaware senator will not back away from combat in the erroneous zone portraying mccain as a good man who has fallen into bad company with conservative republicans
8449269 whose three and a half decade hold on alaskas sole house seat was imperiled by political ethics controversies trailed lt gov sean parnell in a protracted vote count in tuesdays primary that appeared headed for a cliffhanger finale
8449270 easily fended off challengers in his tuesday contest even though he faces more immediate legal problems than young
8449271 has been struggling to maintain his democratic base thus far in august
8449272 the 63 of conservative democrats supporting obama over mccain in aug 18 24 polling is the lowest obama has earned since he clinched the democratic nomination in june at the same time there have been no similar drops in support for obama in the preferences of liberal or moderate democrats
8449273 has mainly seen his support eroding among moderate and liberal republicans from 19 to 13 during august
8449274 is planning to rollout his vice presidential nominee in three battleground states this weekend with large scale rallies planned for ohio pennsylvania and missouri
8449275 the gop nominee in waiting will move to immediately change the campaign conversation from barack obamas football stadium acceptance speech thursday to the new republican ticket to be revealed at a noontime friday rally in a dayton ohio basketball arena
8449276 look i owe the american people an apology if i had beaten the old man youd of never heard of the kid and you wouldnt be in this mess so its all my fault and i feel that very very strongly so this is an important election for us let me tell ya
8449277 hillarys speech a success in the hall was a study in the virtue of low expectations
8449278 id say that sen clinton has had the best performance so far by a wide margin both in terms of attacking john mccain and the republicans head on and defining a nauseatingly comprehensive set of plans for raising taxes getting mad at companies for shipping job overseas and pushing universal health care or more accurately even more expensive and less effective health care
8449279 she started out a little dull and a little self obsessed but then she rallied a little no way no how no mccain was a good line and the twin cities analogy was a great little riff on bush and mccain but i have to say her speaking style although much improved over even a year ago is still a little flat when shes passionate she has little inflection when shes quieter shes a little drony the keep going theme moreover was a little unnerving a thinly veiled threat
8449280 stunning hillary rodham clintons convention speech on tuesday was so not what barack obama needed
8449281 she gracefully marked her place as one of americas premiere politicians with a firm commanding gracious argument on behalf of barack obama
8449282 his efforts at bi partisanship were confusing his specifics irritatingly vague his style bland and his speech meandering
8449283 so where do the three contenders stand after one match a piece
8449284 was hillary clintons speech more diss than endorsement for sen barack obama
8449285 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8449286 i thought she hit it out of the park clear home run she was unequivocal she said obama is my candidate and as you pointed out it was no way no how no mccain
8449287 did delegates leave that hall last night saying she shouldve been the one josh
8449288 t here are always a couple of people who are questioning but i think overall
8449289 taken a day and a half of the oxygen from this convention in denver
8449290 i dont think thats an issue at all i mean i think hillary clinton last night was there for barack obama hitting his messages do you want more of the same or do you want to stand behind somebody whos ready for change on the economy on health care on foreign policy there was no question about that and hillary clinton was there to stand up for barack obama and thats exactly what she did
8449291 your home would need to be zoned for part time business use may require zoning change which includes hearing before local boards depending on the current class
8449292 we are the least worried about the box office because we have already entered into tie ups in the west a chain of theatres has already decided to screen this film in north america likewise we have taken over a film distribution company in europe moreover we will be getting subsidies also
8449293 yes i have never ever been so relaxed all these years because this film is an event and has been accepted and i am satisfied
8449294 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate and future performance will inevitably be linked to the eco nomies of the uk and to a lesser extent the republic of ireland
8449295 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time
8449296 were announcing the launch of ubiquity a mozilla labs experiment into connecting the web with language in an attempt to find new user interfaces that could make it possible for everyone to do common web tasks more quickly and easily
8449297 the problem with the way the web stands now is that i have to go to services to use them
8449298 what id really like to do is have user generated mashups mashups that i care about where i care about them
8449299 we have the situation now where any remote worker can use any windows pc with the usb client which allows secure access to applications
8449300 customers can choose to halt the connection if the pc has no antivirus protection or put the user into a sandbox from where they can download one if necessary
8449301 we would go in and find out about the customers needs and advise on how to architect a solution around their existing domain we use as much as possible of their existing infrastructure
8449302 nokia has the best portfolio in the market to deal with the slowing economy
8449303 this will help drive sales assuming it has the right look specification and usability
8449304 lack of 3g and hot applications such as gps and good quality internet browsing
8449305 the debate over cost keeps getting forgotten but government should remember that the goal is to prevent climate change and we need to ask what is the cheapest way of doing that
8449306 in that light it is clear first generation biofuels are far too expensive
8449307 we cant tackle climate change in a world where tropical deforestation continues and there is now plenty of evidence that demand for energy crops is exacerbating that problem
8449308 pushing for effective sustainability standards for biofuels and for eu policy to be reviewed in light of any emerging evidence
8449309 i would rather pay 5 to a forestry project in borneo than around 200 to a farmer in the us producing biofuels
8449310 we are paying lots of different groups to change the way they behave and the products they produce so we might as well target the most cost effective

8449314 nun ja eine beschreibung die auch auf jeden blog passen k nnte ausgew hlt wird schlie lich auch da und auch nicht nur die verlobte von boris becker ganz im gegenteil solche klatschgeschichten kommen dort ganz im gegensatz zu den etablierten medien eher selten vor
8449315 nie waren handwerklich und ethisch gut ausgebildete journalisten notwendiger als heute um das berleben des qualit tsjournalismus in der digitalen welt zu sichern
8449316 enth lt wenig was neu oder berpr fbar w re
8449317 drohen die medien zum surrealen kettenbrief digitaler illusionen und t uschungen zu werden wo die fakten durch meinungen und die professionellen nachrichtensammeler von durchgeknallten kommentatoren ersetzt werden
8449318 tidak ada desakan siapa yang boleh desak saya saya dengan kuasa saya ketua pembangkang dengan kuasanya perdana menteri dengan kuasanya masing masing dengan kuasa masing masing
8449319 tidak ada sebab mengapa tidak boleh angkat sumpah esok apabila sudah diberitahu
8449320 hanya seorang yang datang angkat sumpah tidak perlu datang semua
8449321 ini persidangan biasa cuma kita ada satu kekosongan bagi permatang pauh
8449322 anggapan saya mesti ada tata tertib mungkin anwar boleh mengawal ahli ahli parlimen daripada pembangkang supaya tidak keterlaluan melanggar peraturan mesyuarat
8449323 walaupun ada pihak yang mengatakan adanya ketua pembangkang yang punya status seperti anwar akan menyebabkan dewan bergolak tetapi saya tidak melihat begitu
8449324 politik hari ini mungkin berbeza dengan esok mungkin mereka buat usul tidak percaya mungkin tidak buat
8449325 i placed a suit of armor in this general area

8449327 experimenting on this corpse here on the altar just like yesterday wanna see a decaying spleen
8449328 laughs nah im just trying to find a new amp evil way to torture innocent citizens you know to advance the art of necromancy
8449329 good question you know those werewolves dont really talk too much shed like you wouldnt believe though disgusting
8449330 yeah i know hey thanks for letting us use your crib as a base of operations for our evil necromancy experimentations
8449331 oh dont worry about it you guys are so much better then those stupid goblins we had in here about a decade or so ago ugh skulls amp rats everywhere it was unbelievable and the smell
8449332 you mean you dont mind our zombies because they you know smell kind of horrible
8449333 decaying flesh i can handle goblins who havent bathed in over a month im a ghost amp i nearly vomited whenever i walked near them it was that bad
8449334 we couldnt be more excited with the creative direction josh schwartz and his team are executing on chuck
8449335 this show has really hit its stride and deserves a full season commitment to carry out the producers vision for this unique series
8449336 if the hype around privacy gains more credibility more people will hit the private button there is a potential threat here to click through advertising

8449339 rgz tv is broadcasting interviews with rachel cohn jay asher sonya sones and paula yoo the uploaded videos have been shot and edited by the readergirlz founders and members of the postergirlz
8449340 our activities are very new and very interesting to cluj
8449341 there is a great demand for knowledge about improving life in this country how to communicate better how to improve the education of children how to raise living standards and this is exactly what people find in the 19 courses at the yellow tent
8449342 i came here very skeptical but at the same time attracted by something when i heard your announcement on tv i felt that this was just for me and just at the right time i was looking for something that i was missing
8449343 i came here and of all the brochures i picked up the one about communication was what i wanted this was what i was missing
8449344 i made friends very quickly with the team they were very eager to help me and after just the first hour i understood many things i understood how simple relationships between people are and how easy it can be to communicate
8449345 after two hours i postponed all my meetings for the next week because for me what i found here was urgent and a total priority
8449346 i read the booklet page by page like a person who was thirsty for information i got my answers
8449347 what impressed me was the applicability of what i learned that i could use it practically every day
8449348 children will certainly benefit from a more attentive orientation to their needs just like the orthodox religion recommends as well listening to the one sitting in front of you and loving him or her is the most important thing in order to have him or her as a trustworthy communication partner
8449349 the technology of study course not only changed my perception about learning but more importantly it gave me a perception because school did not
8449350 i can say that now i am more aware when i read learn my reading is much more efficient because i no longer need to read a sentence several times also by concentrating more on words my memory is more profound
8449351 understanding the barriers of study and the ways of avoiding them opened up new horizons for me in my professional and spiritual evolution
8449352 as a freshman therese had one of the best years of any player we have had at unlv
8449353 she is very mature and besides her talent her biggest strength may be her consistency from tournament to tournament she had a great summer and i look for her to carry that over to this season
8449354 the times reports on the problems of adding wind farms to the power grid because of the grids old design it
8449355 yet more confirmation of my theory that this was all a brilliant scam
8449356 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8449357 joe biden is being dishonest on energy either that or he does not understand the problem the democratic platform he forwarded is biofuel a net energy user and wind solar wind solar can only power 25 of the electric grid because of its intermittent nature we need to generate more steady state electricity and pursue methods to apply it to our transportation needs this should include new coal and nuclear power plants to generate the electricity electric railroads and fuel cells need to be pursued to transform electricity to motive force this is the only realistic way to divorce ourselves from oil i feel no need to send more troops to afghanistan or rebuild georgia i believe that our only presence in that part of the world should be an isolated military footprint in iraq this would protect the iraqis from the russians as well as protect our access to a large oil reserve
8449358 i should also note that i got a peek at john kerrys speech and it looks like its going to be a real stemwinder dont miss it
8449359 we made this show to show you what the clone wars are

8449380 the sentence now in the draft which ties the creation to the experimentation is exactly right
8449381 under the current language in this document does this mean that you can experiment on human embryos that are frozen in ivf clinics
8449382 the way i read this sentence is that it does have limited application it does not call for a ban on everything that i might support the amendment that has been put forward would ban not only the type of research that i oppose but also the types of therapeutic research i have described
8449383 we should not be in the business of prohibiting therapeutic research
8449384 i certainly would accept the amendment but the former prosecutor in me would like mr bopp to answer my question
8449385 the defense attorney in me would say i have answered her question

8449510 the boks wouldnt be in this position if there was a director of coaching who helped map out a style of play

8449574 so what are your expectations for this years u s open
8449575 well i just come in and try to prepare the best i can and be ready for anything because i never try to set expectations in terms of getting to a certain round because i feel like sometimes thats out of my control if a guy comes out and plays the best match of his life you know theres not much you can do so i try to do my best and be ready for anything that comes my way
8449576 how are you feeling personally though are you at the top of your game healthy everything
8449577 yeah i feel confident im trying to take some positives out of the olympics and the fact that i beat roger federer for the first time and won a few other pretty close matches so im excited about that and ive definitely had some success this summer so im definitely looking forward to this u s open every time i get to the open its a whole new shot of adrenaline for me and the excitement of having my home fans here is just great
8449578 its an obvious question but being from new york can you talk a little more about how special the u s open is to you
8449579 yeah for me its the one i circle on the calendar at the beginning of every year its the biggest event in tennis in my mind and ive been a fan of this tournament since i was a kid so to come out here being a player as well as a fan is just incredible it still gives me goose bumps walking out on to arthur ashe stadium and to get to play there and know that theres so many kids traveling down from connecticut up from new jersey pennsylvania just to see this event and how many of them want to be pro tennis players or want to be like their idols and im one of the people theyre watching its just thrilling to me
8449580 always yeah every year id come down here when i was young id come with my parents and as i got older some of my friends started getting their licenses id come with them and i would just come down here every year night matches night sessions at the open theres just really nothing else like it
8449581 i used to root for stefan edberg i liked watching him and i liked watching jim courier a lot as well he had just that mentality of a worker a guy that knew how hard he had worked and knew he was going to out work his opponent
8449582 you touched upon this but how much of a highlight was beating federer in the olympics
8449583 in my mind theres a good chance hell go down as the greatest player of all time hed beaten me eight times in a row so to go out there and just keep persevering and make sure every time you go in you have the confidence that you can win that match even though hes beaten you so many times in a row hes obviously got tons of talent and ability and confidence and to go out there and just play as well as i had to to win and serve really well when i needed to at big times it was just something that boosts your confidence because i can go out and say as many times as i want to that i have confidence and feel like i can beat him but until you go out there and do it i dont think anyone really believes you
8449584 so its a victory youll carry with you for a long time
8449585 yeah its something ill remember for a long time really at the end of my career i feel like thatll be one of the matches that to say that on an olympic stage i beat possibly the greatest player of all time thats something that ill be pretty proud of for a long time i think
8449586 and where other pro athletes might be a little more indifferent it was something that federer wanted very badly to win an olympic gold medal
8449587 yeah i saw an interview with the ioc president jacques rogge and he said that thatll be his enduring memory of this olympics to see roger federer crying on the olympic medal stand hes arguably one of the best known athletes internationally and was one of the most accomplished athletes at the olympics and for him to win the doubles gold medal which people might think is a consolation prize compared to the singles gold but for him to win that and show the kind of emotion he did for his country and for his team its something thats really special and it makes me know that he really did want to win badly in the quarterfinals of the olympics singles tournament and that he definitely gave it his all in terms of his competition with me
8449588 what do you think of the federer vs rafael nadal argument nadals ranked no 1 but is he truly the best
8449589 nadals had a much better year this year than anyone else so youve got to just tip your cap to him and say that hes improved and hes definitely shown incredible improvement from just a few years ago when i played him here at the open hes really improved his game on other surfaces besides clay cause hes always had tons and tons of ability on clay but hes really been able to adjust his game to the hard courts and to the grass courts
8449590 does nadal have the kind of talent to approach a federer type career
8449591 its possible hes so young and theres so many things that could happen he could just continue to improve at the rate hes improving at and then he could make this conversation about roger kind of futile if he goes and surpasses it by a great margin but he could also hit a plateau and not improve and have the rest of the tour catch up to him so its so hard to say when someones that young theres a million things that could happen injuries just getting kind of bored with the situation losing your confidence theres so many things that could happen negatively that if he keeps moving in a positive direction then he could eclipse all of those records
8449592 so is it fair to say that focus might be more crucial in tennis than in other sports
8449593 yeah definitely we play 20 some odd tournaments a year and then youve got davis cup the olympics every four years and theres just so many things that go into it your calendar is going from january to november and if you lose focus for just a couple of months it can really affect you negatively and theres really no time to rest and just kind of relax and get that focus back so youve got to kind of do it on the run and thats something that tennis players if theyre going to be successful theyve got to be pretty good at it obviously rafael has done a great job so far and roger has done an unbelievable job being kind of the target for the last four years so to deal with that is amazing
8449594 more about the olympics i read on your blog that you were surprised at how much mcdonalds all of the athletes ate i was wondering if there was anything else about the olympics village that surprised you
8449595 well that surprised me because theres a huge dining hall and theres a mcdonalds right next to it and i was surprised at how packed the mcdonalds always was and these athletes were always eating that but overall it was awesome to see just to see how many people were just willing to sit down and chat with anyone on their team or on another team and how different all these people could be what different cultures they come from and how they trained how they got there and all that kind of stuff was really a thrill for me to be a part of and as a tennis player we always seem to have next week any time you lose a match you can always say well ill do better next week ill practice for next week but so many of these olympic athletes dont have that they say were going to practice for four years from now and thats a ton of pressure for them to deal with i was proud to be a part of a u s team with so many athletes that competed at their highest levels and they really only get one shot at it or two shots at it in their career
8449596 i loved your line about how you would go to the d hall and see a gymnast next to a weightlifter and be blown away by it
8449597 laughs yeah it was great people watching to see the different shapes and sizes of human beings
8449598 what about the reports of a party atmosphere at the olympics village did you see much as far as that goes
8449599 yeah i think those people like i said they train so hard to get there for four years that once theyre done they deserve to go out and enjoy themselves a little bit unfortunately i didnt get to really partake in that because as soon as i was done i knew i had the u s open to get ready for so i got to hear about it which was kind of par for the course im used to not partying as much in terms of playing matches especially late here in the u s open and then other people tell me stories about how much fun new york city is at night here and i dont get to be a part of it here or at the olympics i didnt get a real chance to but i got enough partying out of my system when i was in college so im getting old now im a veteran on tour so i dont need that as much anymore but i heard about it in beijing and i think they deserve that and anyone who thinks differently i think is a little foolish because i really believe they deserve everything they can and every bit of celebration even if they didnt get a medal if they did their best there then they deserve to go out and enjoy themselves
8449600 yeah either way its four years in the making of either extreme disappointment or extreme elation
8449601 exactly so either way theyve worked so hard and to deal with that kind of pressure people in most situations even in most pro sports in most jobs they dont deal with that kind of pressure your whole career coming down to 10 seconds on the track or 30 seconds in a swimming pool once youve set aside so much of your life to get ready for that once its all over you might want to enjoy yourself for a night or two
8449602 or at least have a drink or two to take the edge off

8449605 a vision of foreign policy that has ranged far beyond iraq
8449606 there is a clear choice in this election for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies
8449607 barack obama has proven he has the judgment to deliver the change we need
8449608 while sen mccain was a cheerleader for the bush administrations rush to a war against a nation that posed no imminent threat barack obama and i opposed the war in iraq from day one
8449609 sen mccain wants to stay in iraq indefinitely spending 10 billion a month while iraqi politicians sit atop a 79 billion surplus
8449610 before he ever debates barack obama johh mccain should finish the debate with himself
8449611 and whats more sen mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear
8449612 its going really well there are several hours of fairly polished game to play were actively testing parts of the game and getting feedback from play testers and things are coming together its fun its in focus we know what bits are fun and which are not and its just a matter of time now ive probably never been as happy or excited about the game as i am these days

8449653 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8449654 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8449655 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8449656 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8449657 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8449678 i have always wanted to teach and i am a failure at the only thing i wanted to be good at because of choices i made

8449692 if desired the cabinet can keep a vacant seat vacant until the next general election
8449693 the voters in jurong grc had voted us as a team and not as individuals
8449694 it is baseless to say with the absence of one or more members that the rest of us have lost our electoral mandate and have to resign
8449695 do we really want to risk overburdening the minister for finance in these trying economic times
8449696 practicality demands a by election and certainly in jurong grc
8449697 that voting and elections are luxuries and unnecessary in bad times
8449698 it means that the fundemental priniples of democracy can be waived by the government of the day when deemed inexpedient that cannot be right

8449701 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday
8449702 out of our first unit i thought we tackled better
8449703 still not as well as we need to but better than we have in the past we had some assignment errors but they did it full speed
8449704 i thought one thing that did shine was our tackle
8449705 i thought jerry franklin had an exceptional day at tackle
8449706 elton ford is going to be a wonderful football player
8449707 we are going to have growing pains with him but he sees things breaks well and hes starting to play the game pretty good so hes another guy that stood out that day
8449708 our experience is up front with our older players but we have all new starters at our secondary positions and inexperience at the linebacker position thats kind of scary going into the first game so you have to be not so much scared but aware of what your opponent can bring to the table western illinois is a fine football team were playing on saturday
8449709 according to all the newspaper clippings hes one of the top five at his position
8449710 that says enough in itself but when you watch him on film we sit down there and breakdown plays by personnel and this basic personnel group we call regular you basically recruit that kid or draft that kid off that one clip the guy is an outstanding football player
8449711 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8449712 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8449713 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition of when life begins
8449714 there are plenty of catholics living a life rife with sin that seek to justify their behavior by saying they disagree with the church on the source of their delinquency
8449715 maybe thats the source of pelosis confusion she really doesnt understand the difference between the teaching authority of the catholic church and the dnc
8449716 have the stage an attentive audience and a winning position
8449717 we clearly recognize that we have responsibility and liability for this but we have been unable in the short term that weve been talking to reach agreement as to what the value of the case is
8449718 this is one of the inevitable consequences of a tragedy like this
8449719 is completely false our camp never approached the obama camp the obama and clinton camps were calling our office before the puerto rican primary trying to get yankee to endorse them the mccain camp approached us as well
8449720 you know their behavior alone oftentimes excludes them from participation in this program because theyre not under our guidelines innocent victims of crime they participated in the crime on some level
8449721 being violently assaulted by someone inebriated or not is a violation of your personhood
8449722 the idea that you are going to sit around and figure out what percentage of the blame you are going to ascribe to the victim themselves is just completely misguided and improper
8449723 a case by case review is only as good as the rules that govern that review discretion vested in officials should not turn into a character assassination of the victim or be used to play out archaic gender stereotypes
8449724 just would not look at drugs and alcohol on sexual assault cases
8449725 due to limited crime compensation funding it appears that compensation officers are forced to look for reasons not to provide funds rather than reasons to provide funds
8449726 the elephant in the room is not the issue of denial because of contributory conduct
8449727 when you start putting blame on other people without looking at your own internal procedures there is a problem
8449728 advocates are just as busy as victims of crime compensation we all need to work together to make sure victims are getting the help they need
8449729 cause i used meth its ok for someone to rape me

8449744 mido enjoys it here the only thing he wants is to play football and he wants to be first choice but hes also aware no club can guarantee him that
8449745 i work with him and all the players the reason he joined is he believes in what were trying to do here and i think he can still play a big part in that hes a big crowd favourite despite all the difficulties he had last season
8449746 hes a good player and we want those here hes a talent and you want all your players to fulfil their talent its time he had a more settled period in his career and was at a club for a bit longer
8449747 his attitude to not starting has been first class and hes had a big impact from the bench
8449748 all the forwards have got different attributes and skills his ability to win headers and his physical presence is something our other strikers dont have so it gives me great options
8449749 allah menjanjikan orang orang yang beriman dan beramal soleh dari kalangan kamu wahai umat muhammad bahwa dia akan menjadikan mereka khalifah khalifah yang memegang kuasa pemerintahan di bumi sebagaimana dia telah menjadikan orang orang yang sebelum mereka khalifah khalifah yang berkuasa dan dia akan menguatkan dan mengembangkan agama mereka agama islam yang telah diredhainya untuk mereka dan dia juga akan menggantikan bagi mereka keamanan setelah mereka mengalami ketakutan dari ancaman musuh mereka terus beribadat kepadaku dengan tidak mempersekutukan sesuatu yang lain denganku dan ingatlah sesiapa yang kufur ingkar sesudah itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang durhaka

8449757 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic

8449761 ive lived in a state that has been blighted by racial discrimination
8449762 since then the deep south has been dominated by the republican party using the race issue as a subtle and sometimes overt racial appeal
8449763 im more than happy to see the large number of young people
8449764 barack obama is not an african american nominee he is the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8449765 t hats what this struggle was all about to create one america one house and that is what barack obama represents
8449766 we must make the dream real we must make it real i think it will be real

8449768 many other people who sign their ballots will make a different choice
8449769 and you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates for the democratic party
8449770 in 2001 the oil companies the war contractors and the neocon artists seized the economy and added 4 trillion of unproductive spending to the national debt trillions of dollars for an unnecessary war paid for with borrowed money
8449771 wake up america the insurance companies took over health care wake up america the pharmaceutical companies took over drug pricing wake up america the speculators took over wall street wake up america we went into iraq for oil
8449772 this administration can tap our phones but they can t tamper our creative spirit
8449773 they can open our mail but the can t open economic opportunities they can track our every move but they lost track of the economy while the cost of food gasoline and electricity skyrockets now they have skillfully played our post 9 11 fears and theyve allowed the few to profit at the expense of the many
8449774 a lot of these people may be lost they may not be familiar with milwaukee they may be looking for the hotel block party or restaurant they may make a sudden lane change and may stop or slow suddenly in traffic and by just giving the motorcycyle enthusiasts in town this week a little extra space we can prevent a lot of accidents from occurring
8449775 welcome riders thanks for the rumble not the roar throttle down in town
8449776 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8449777 the person that brought it to my attention did ask does that mean if youre mute you cant play golf on the lpga tour
8449778 do you have to pass an exam who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8449779 what if you have a person who genuinely struggles with learning a new language they have a learning disability
8449780 there are people out there who dont naturally pick up second languages
8449781 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring
8449782 its definitely created some excitement among the players brett quigley said on wednesday at the tpc boston site of the second round of the u s pga tour playoffs
8449783 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem
8449784 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut harrington said
8449785 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8449786 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8449787 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back laird said
8449788 and im sure theres a few guys that dont love it but you know its the playoffs its like any sport you play to get there and when you get there its whoever is playing best at that time that comes out on top
8449789 i really didnt see that jankovic said wednesday after her 6 3 6 7 5 7 5 win
8449790 maybe she lifted her arm up but i didnt see it i was so tired and it doesnt mean its bad sportsmanship it was not my intention
8449791 also the receiver should always follow the server when im ready to serve she should be ready to receive those are the rules
8449792 right away lets cut to the chase djokovic said with a grin
8449793 its going to be good in two days im sure
8449794 its like this tournament it supports me in some kind of way she said
8449795 i dont know how to explain i just play much more confident im enjoying this city so much the crowd when you play here its a different atmosphere and you just have so much fun being on the court
8449796 i dont think you should be coming into a grand slam and playing first matches with the best game youve got she said
8449797 i want to grow every match playing better and better today i played much better than my first match so its looking good for me
8449798 when they named this 46 1 2 acre corona park which is a public park after me i thought ive got to do something within a year i want to do some initiative something that will make a difference she said
8449799 believe it or not the hats you see are made from plastic bottles said danny zausner the managing director of the tennis center

8449815 i wanted to try a robot waiter made of bread
8449816 we wanted to put technology into the hands of as many people as possible
8449817 there is a tendency for those who saw queensland in the 1970s and 80s from a distance as an embarrassing national joke simply the product of police corruption tawdry sex draconian regulations and incompetent politicians
8449818 were going to have 25 varieties of heirloom tomatoes coming up and 30 varieties of hot peppers and eggplant and potatoes
8449819 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8449820 hey buddy in life it really doesnt matter what you do just that you do it wholly with your entire being fully in no whining allowed
8449821 not sure how smart of an idea this is picking the only straight guy left going into drag queen week
8449822 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8449823 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8449824 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8449825 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8449826 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8449827 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8449828 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8449829 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8449830 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8449831 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8449832 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8449833 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8449834 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8449835 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8449836 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8449837 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8449838 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8449839 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8449840 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8449841 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8449842 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8449843 who are open to doing something on the production side
8449844 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8449845 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8449846 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8449847 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8449848 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8449849 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8449850 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8449851 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8449852 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8449853 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8449854 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8449855 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8449856 am very interested to also learn how to stop my chihuahuas from running up down the stairs i have tried to walk up the stairs first blocking them on every third step or so sometimes it works other times the three little brats run past me and believe it or not these brats do not respond to treats
8449857 we can confirm that on 21 august a single hotel in germany was compromised by a virus the compromise permitted access to reservations data for that property only
8449858 this has affected only ten customers who are currently being contacted to offer our assistance none of these were gb customers there is no evidence of any unauthorised access to any other customer data
8449859 we think hes one of the best young defensemen in the game and he plays in all situations general manager doug wilson said wednesday
8449860 and we think hell only get better playing with some of the players weve added this summer
8449861 thatd be nice because then id know id be in a top pair vlasic said recognizing that with a new coach todd mclellan behind the bench forward lines defense pairings and ice time are all undetermined
8449862 i like the place a lot and i wanted to stay
8449863 the idea that the cosmos itself undergoes an immense indeed an infinite number of deaths and rebirths it is only in the vedas in which the time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology age is billions of years a millennium before europeans were willing to divest themselves of the biblical idea that the world was a few thousand years old the mayans were thinking of millions and the indians billions
8449864 when i read the bhagavad gita and reflect about how god created this universe everything else seems so superfluous
8449865 the sacred books the vedas claim truth is one but sages call it by different names if only all the rest of the monotheistic book religions had learned that lesson all the horror of historys religious wars could have been avoided which

8449868 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit
8449869 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8449870 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica

8449872 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama

8449874 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8449875 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti
8449876 were going to turn him lose and hes going to play
8449877 it took about three days in camp to say that this kid is going to play this year hell help our team somewhere
8449878 hes not going to go in there and bull rush 310 pounders but he practices smart and hes got quickness and speed
8449879 ce prosti am fost puteam sa le dam 500 0

8449883 ce mai conteaza am batut asta este norocu nostru suntem cei tari
8449884 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8449885 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8449886 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8449887 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8449888 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8449889 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8449890 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8449891 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8449892 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato
8449893 for 16 days i didnt know what was happening in the world
8449894 could have been a great opportunity to show improvements in human rights and make a better international image for china
8449895 but instead the government stressed security and the old set of control methods such as mobilizing the whole people
8449896 people who want to express their opinions or defend their rights will keep using the few channels they have
8449897 i still dont know when i can next see hu jia in jail i can only keep fighting for it as early as possible
8449898 she could be taken away at any time we will sue the re education through labor committee we cannot protest but we will use other means
8449899 the authorities are too strict is there any principle behind this we will keep fighting
8449900 will continue to pursue comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system
8449901 i had no hope that the olympics would hasten political reform
8449902 look at what happened not a single protest was approved in the three protest parks and while foreign news media had greater freedom than before there was strict control on what the chinese media could write
8449903 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech freedom of religion while the world was watching
8449904 setting up protest areas still represents progress the ordinary people want to express their opinions and the authorities must gradually improve this
8449905 but it needs concrete implementation measures or otherwise its just an empty slogan
8449906 there will be limited experiments like more competition in the official local elections
8449907 we cannot import a political system from anywhere else and expect it to work
8449908 we need more time to understand the western political systems and decide what is best for chinas path of development
8449909 the west does not understand china we need more face to face exchange like the olympics
8449910 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8449911 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8449912 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8449913 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8449914 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8449915 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8449916 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia
8449917 il primo impegno della futura amministrazione americana devessere quello di un lavoro comune
8449918 mettiamoci nei panni russi conclude casini ma anche nei nostri
8449919 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8449920 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8449921 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8449922 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8449923 no one works for someone we all just work together
8449924 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8449925 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8449926 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8449927 people will be looking to understand the rationale besides party loyalty and party unity what is the specific rationale behind his support of barack obama
8449928 its weird i never watched lost until just last weekend but ive totally had dreams about being stranded on an island before and theyre bizarrely similar to what happens in lost
8449929 isnt it confusing to start watching it in a later season
8449930 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8449931 while the numbers have not been rising every suicide is regrettable
8449932 despite these efforts to prevent suicides a few cases still occur each year
8449933 they showed no early warning signals or sign of trouble which alerted teachers and other school staff to act
8449934 mantendr mi completo apoyo al consejo de seguridad y a sus miembros en su incansable tarea de hacer que este indispensable rgano sea m s eficiente transparente e inclusivo
8449935 cada vez m s complejas responsabilidades del consejo de seguridad en el mantenimiento de la paz y la seguridad internacionales
8449936 esto hace que para el consejo sea fundamental seguir estudiando sus m todos de trabajo
8449937 eficiente y responsable de cara al creciente conjunto de retos
8449938 ganar transparencia inclusi n y apertura en la toma de decisiones
8449939 me comprometo a que permanezca la fil pero no me comprometo a que permanezca ra l padilla al frente
8449940 la universidad de guadalajara no est en condiciones de seguir aportando recursos para algo que no representa beneficio para la universidad
8449941 voy a revisar el asunto voy a preguntar a la directora de la fil
8449942 i do about 110 full color pages a year but doing 200 black and white graytoned in a matter of months
8449943 i do about 110 full color pages a year but doing 200 black and white graytoned in a matter of months
8449944 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8449945 what did you say and i said it was a miracle
8449946 it is hard to envision a catalyst that will drive these bonds higher
8449947 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8449948 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8449949 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8449950 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8449951 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8449952 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8449953 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8449954 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8449955 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8449956 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8449957 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8449958 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8449959 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8449960 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8449961 while i regret my three years of incarceration i have no bitterness and now understand how it could happen
8449962 most valuable and economical defector this agency has ever had
8449963 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8449964 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8449965 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8449966 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8449967 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8449968 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8449969 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8449970 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8449971 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8449972 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8449973 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8449974 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8449975 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8449976 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8449977 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8449978 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8449979 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8449980 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8449981 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8449982 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8449983 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8449984 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8449985 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8449986 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8449987 com os olhos fixos no futuro em nome da uni o com o objetivo da vit ria com f em nosso partido e em nosso pa s vamos declarar com uma s voz aqui e agora que barack obama o nosso candidato e ele ser o nosso presidente
8449988 is added to the n series you can keep the exposure in a dark situation night time or indoor as long as you wish it gives the picture a sense of motion the holga is now sort of a pinhole camera detailed instruction is in the menu
8449989 the entire project is expected to include up to 50 additional locations yard management plus a variety of asset tracking classes which may include passive and active rfid plus gps tracking of vehicles on the same platform
8449990 our carrier grade mobilefusion platform links location sensitive data from networks to erp applications such as inventory billing and order entry
8449991 in this application the critical business requirement is to ensure cable reels are in the correct yard at the right time to guarantee service delivery
8449992 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition
8449993 we will see 21 films and i hope and i have a lot of confidence in marco that we will see 21 films that will give us the state of art of what is cinema today
8449994 to find films that are truly contemporary and have finger on the pulse of the times
8449995 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford
8449996 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8449997 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8449998 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8449999 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
