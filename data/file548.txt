5480001 the situation had all of the ingredients for a perfect storm i needed to get out from under a long term deal that had no guarantees left they needed a commitment from their quarterback to get to town and learn their new system the fact that i was injured and it was recommended that i rehab in a warm climate only complicated the matter
5480002 youre donating something thats going to be thrown in the garbage
5480003 childrens lives can be saved by something that can get thrown away
5480004 i would never ever consent a patient while in labor

5480007 mates and he suggests that obama identifies more with his
5480008 did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois
5480009 obama has yet to answer questions about whether he ever dealt drugs
5480010 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

5480012 he was genuine and you could feel the love and concern he had
5480013 i was thinking why do both of them have to be running together

5480015 he was concerned about me and he wanted to know step by step what i did

5480017 we are aware of the ruling and will take some time to determine how we will proceed
5480018 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5480019 these seven verses have caused more unhappiness and misery in the christian east and west than any other seven verses in the new testament by the license they have given to tyrants and the support for tyrants the church has felt called on to offer as a result of the presence of romans 13 in the bible
5480020 is the christian under obligation to support whatever policies the governing authorities may deem appropriate whether those policies are for the good of the people or simply for the purpose of keeping those governing authorities in power is that what this verse means does paul place on christians the obligation to obey all edicts of whatever government happens to hold civil power over them does every government however established and however maintained have equal claim to the divine sanction these verses confer on governing authorities such are the kind questions this passage poses for us how are we to answer them
5480021 romans 13 carries a hidden nevertheless at its heart jesus is lord nevertheless his followers must obey their earthly rulers this is not because the rulers have somehow in theory already submitted to christs lordship but despite the fact that they have not done so
5480022 to assert that god created the powers does not imply that god endorses any particular power at any given time romans 13 1 7 does not legitimate blind obedience to an oppressive system it says rather that governments are indispensable for the preservation of social order and protection against criminals and invaders they are supposed to be a terror not to good conduct but to bad oppressive regimes however are just the reverse they reward bad conduct and are a terror to those who do good
5480023 you see tony that got the ball rolling and pretty soon we had a coup on our hands new elections were called and a two party system was inaugurated today because of the churchs obedience to christ malawi is a free nation
5480024 the west gharib acquisition established transglobe as a producing operator in the middle east and we are very pleased to increase our interest
5480025 the early drilling successes have proved the value of the assets we believe there are more production and reserve gains to come from the west gharib lands
5480026 with this successful drilling and completion of the horizontal well fairborne has significantly increased both the flow rate and flowing pressures from the nordegg formation in the harlech area by 10 times over the average vertical producer

5480030 we do not need a stimulus plan which would be an artificial plan
5480031 we are not in a recession but we are feeling the effects of a brutal difficult crisis
5480032 the problem is that we have extremely limited room to manoeuvre because we have wasted quite a bit over the past year so maybe we should have the courage to put the fiscal package back on the table
5480033 this would asphyxiate the economy at a time when it frankly doesnt need this
5480034 its a dangerous plan and its just another ticket clipper for pgw

5480053 the one down year the 2000 games in sydney was probably a result of the collapsing internet sector which even the most positive investor moods wouldnt have been able to overcome

5480056 if hes on the ticket he will help every democrat in the state of indiana just as he always has
5480057 if you look back to 1988 when dan quayle was on the ticket you know a familiar name a guy named evan bayh you know won the governors office as a democrat so you know its not unheard of and its not an automatic that a hoosier vice presidential candidate will mean big things for the rest of the slate
5480058 it may affect the kind of support and the kind of energy that the left has in going out to work for the ticket
5480059 now having said that the left is probably so ready for a change in washington that it probably would not adversely affect things that badly
5480060 i know that the extent of the changes under the way forward reform strategies may cause some staff uncertainty as to their future within the department

5480064 abolishing operational agreements and casualisation is a serious health and safety concern for corrective services staff and for inmates
5480065 in corrective services we need permanent skilled staff trained for the dangers and challenges of the job not backpackers looking for a quick buck

5480180 for many veterans the closest va facility isnt close enough
5480181 this is a year that ive been looking forward to as far as getting my chance to be in that first group
5480182 ive really taken the challenge of being the player that i want to be and helping these guys to a bowl game ive finally gotten a chance to be where i want to be at as a starter at left guard
5480183 bryons a really good player and hes really stepped up this year ive been playing between left and right guard too but either way well both hopefully going to be playing its still back and forth
5480184 weve split the reps with the first and the second unit with both of those guys to see how they play
5480185 i love the competition and i love the fact that they both want to be the guy they both understand that when theyre not in the game and the other guy is in hes going to play well they trust each other hopefully between now and the next two weeks well sort it out as to exactly who is the starter and if it is still this close i suspect that youll see both of them play in the game
5480186 so whether im starting every day or not im still going to compete like im fighting for that job ill just keep working hard and keep believing in myself like i have and well just see how things turn out for the season opener
5480187 the best one ive had in all of my years here
5480188 theyre always around and theyre always there to help so its a good situation with them being in front of me
5480189 most of us revel in the fact that we dont know
5480190 when you came out against the war early we celebrated you
5480191 when you talked about bringing the troops home we backed you and then you have back peddled and compromised a little bit on were going to send the troops to afghanistan instead of bringing them home and then there was the fisa bill that you compromised on
5480192 are you going to set an agenda of change or one of compromise with what the republican minority is going to allow you to do in the congress
5480193 i guess this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to people making more than 2 5 million because i guess theyre middle class

5480195 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now
5480196 he obviously doesnt do his own shopping hes obviously not paying his own bills the economic disaster is here right now and the choice we have in this election is are we going to keep on doing the same things as john mccain is promoting or are we going to bring about a fundamental change in this country
5480197 after being upstaged at the saddleback compassion forum barack obama has adjusted his stump remarks into a hysterical litany of political attacks
5480198 whether he is opposing additional drilling during an energy crisis proposing job killing tax increases on small businesses during a weak economy or fussing about the rigors of campaigning barack obama has not shown the judgment experience or strength needed in our next president
5480199 just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics
5480200 the same people that brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain
5480201 youd think given how badly bush and his folks have performed over the last eight years and considering the fact that john mccain has facilitated and worked with the bush administration on this disaster youd like to think that folks would just say well you know we dont even have to run tv ads you just open up the newspapers and say were going to throw the bums out
5480202 but you know american politics is never that easy weve got to work hard weve got to earn this election

5480216 justins involvement will bring an unprecedented amount of attention and interest to the justin timberlake shriners hospitals for children open which will assist us in our work to help young people receive the quality medical treatment they deserve at no cost we look forward to the bright future of this event
5480217 it sounds like fun we will all be the orchestra members for you to conduct tell us what instruments we should each pretend to play and then later someone else will have a turn to pick a game

5480231 wants to raise the tax rate on the top income bracket from 35 percent to 39 6 percent talk about a recipe for economic disaster
5480232 i believe the fundamentals of this economy are strong and i believe they will remain strong this is a rough patch
5480233 you could make an argument that theres been great progress economically while bush was in office thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic difficulties
5480234 americans are not better off than they were eight years ago
5480235 things are tough right now weve got to address the housing subprime housing problem
5480236 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language
5480237 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5480238 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture
5480239 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
5480240 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and muskoxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard
5480241 this discovery is quite surprising considering that muskoxen occur at such a low density at our site
5480242 careful management and conservation of existing populations of muskoxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5480243 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
5480244 in an age when genetic engineering of the human person is a distinct possibility the challenges our society faces in bioethics have never been more pressing
5480245 the medical school and i have long recognized the importance of bioethics for patient centered care responsible research and technological progress im very pleased that with the generous support of wally and mona wu and the university were now in a position to become nationally prominent in this field
5480246 developments in medicine and biotechnology create an acute need for more advanced education in bioethics
5480247 wake forest is perfectly suited to filling this need with our unique combination of strengths in life sciences the professions and the humanities
5480248 the course of study is designed to assist professionals in deepening their knowledge and understanding of bioethics in order to enhance practice in a variety of fields related to health care delivery and biomedical research
5480249 in adults there has been evidence that less than six hours of sleep a night was associated with high blood pressure levels
5480250 that was one of the more unique findings that poor sleep quality is associated with high blood pressure
5480251 to see how their blood pressure is developing over time
5480252 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
5480253 but the changes in the diurnal patterns for adolescents make it harder for them to get up in the morning and to get to sleep at night if we reorganize the day night schedule for adolescents that could make life easier for them and their parents
5480254 we do know that in adults poor sleep and a diminished amount of sleep are associated with obesity and hormone intolerance
5480255 changes occur in the sympathetic nervous system also fragmentary sleep activates inflammatory pathways
5480256 optimizing sleep hygiene following regular sleep habits turning the light off approximately the same time every night keeping the bedroom quieter and avoiding substances that may disturb sleep such as caffeine
5480257 kids as well as adults need to be allowed to sleep enough
5480258 we say eight hours of sleep a night but it takes an hour to wind down its very very hard to allow enough time to sleep
5480259 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class
5480260 i dont think people would be willing to risk side effects if they knew that the aim of a clinical trial was to boost profits for a pharmaceutical company
5480261 i would think that at some level this is standard practice
5480262 simply shining a bright light on their existence may have already sown the seeds of their destruction
5480263 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5480264 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do scape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5480265 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5480266 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5480267 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5480268 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5480269 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5480270 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5480271 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5480272 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5480273 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it nd perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb

5480283 when you came out against the war early we celebrated you
5480284 when you talked about bringing the troops home we backed you and then you have back peddled and compromised a little bit on were going to send the troops to afghanistan instead of bringing them home and then there was the fisa bill that you compromised on
5480285 are you going to set an agenda of change or one of compromise with what the republican minority is going to allow you to do in the congress
5480286 i guess this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to people making more than 2 5 million because i guess theyre middle class
5480287 hes going to be looking out for them but hes not looking out for most of the people in this auditorium
5480288 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now
5480289 he obviously doesnt do his own shopping hes obviously not paying his own bills the economic disaster is here right now and the choice we have in this election is are we going to keep on doing the same things as john mccain is promoting or are we going to bring about a fundamental change in this country
5480290 after being upstaged at the saddleback compassion forum barack obama has adjusted his stump remarks into a hysterical litany of political attacks
5480291 whether he is opposing additional drilling during an energy crisis proposing job killing tax increases on small businesses during a weak economy or fussing about the rigors of campaigning barack obama has not shown the judgment experience or strength needed in our next president
5480292 just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics
5480293 the same people that brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain
5480294 youd think given how badly bush and his folks have performed over the last eight years and considering the fact that john mccain has facilitated and worked with the bush administration on this disaster youd like to think that folks would just say well you know we dont even have to run tv ads you just open up the newspapers and say were going to throw the bums out
5480295 but you know american politics is never that easy weve got to work hard weve got to earn this election
5480296 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
5480297 was in a panel the other day with rick warren some of you may have seen it and rick warren asked him how do you define rich
5480298 he said maybe he was joking he said 5 million
5480299 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5480300 m sure that comment will be distorted mccain quickly added
5480301 involves the entire magazine category including hundreds of titles across all subject categories
5480302 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5480303 this was not only a grievous injustice but a shame on the state of iowa and the federal government
5480304 these were good decent people who were also the most defenseless
5480305 the difference between them and anybody who is in jail is that in jail the government pays for them but if theyre on the streets we pay for them
5480306 what kind of a government makes prisoners of 43 mothers who all have children and then says you cant work you cant leave and cant stay that boggles the imagination
5480307 it is the most difficult most challenging situation i have ever faced and yet strangely the incident that has been most strengthening of my faith it shows there are a lot of compassionate people because if there werent we wouldnt be able to do what were doing

5480335 kalau urusan kekerabatan menurut saya alumni stan malah lebih baik dari pada tempat lain nggak tahu kenapa kalau kita tahu seseorang dari stan kita langsung merasa sebagai saudara seperguruan dan langsung merasa dekat walaupun kita tidak pernah bersama dominannya budaya jawa di stan juga membantu dalam kedekatan kekerabatan ini dimana ada kecenderungan penghargaan terhadap yg lebih senior
5480336 dari dulu saya nggak pernah berharap banyak kepada sebuah ikatan alumni dimanapun apapun karena saya tahu tidak banyak yg bisa diberikan oleh sebuah organisasi alumni tapi apakah kalau begitu ikatan alumni dibutuhkan jawabnya ya ikatan alumni dibutuhkan agar kita merasa nyaman bahwa ada payung yang melindungi kita apakah ikatan alumni mau aktif atau tidak itu urusan lain

5480365 nansulate has been specified into the main cooling and heating system for this design nansulate added to the mattress cover system was found to reduce cooling temperature at a rate of 1 8 degrees per minute as compared to the foam insulation alone which reduced temperature at a rate of 1 1 degrees per minute all tests were performed under identical conditions cooling one gallon of fluid by speeding up the cooling process substantial energy savings were achieved in addition nansulate prevented sweating during the cooling process and also prevents growth of unwanted substances on the surface of the system
5480366 the same carefully researched cooling and heating system specifying nansulate will be incorporated into a new machine to form x ray invisible casts with perfectly even pressure over the entire area of a broken limb the casts can be worn while swimming or bathing and re formed again with perfectly even pressure when swelling reduces due to nansulate the time to form a perfectly even pressure cast will be approximately three minutes additionally nansulate is being specified in the heating and cooling system for a unique portable machine to heat and or cool with adjustable massage any area of the body for sports medicine and general physiotherapy needs this machine will free up the doctor or technician to perform other tasks the portability of the battery operated machine is due in large part to the energy savings realized with nansulate insulating coatings
5480367 the incorporation of our nansulate coating into these medical devices represents a brand new market segment opportunity edward moore design is an expert in their field and we look forward to our technology offering unique benefits to their company for this medical equipment and other designs energy savings is something that is important to every industry and we are pleased to offer a solution that can be used in a variety of diverse applications

5480524 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5480525 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5480632 this is significant because its establishing a separate independent business from our print product

5480663 sales revenues increased in the second quarter of this year due to the sales of the thermofocus 5 in 1 we are hopeful to build upon this recent success by distributing our unique products attractively through another industry leader we believe this will validate our product offerings as we strive to introduce other innovative products in the near future
5480664 tvts robust and respected physical distribution operation enables the orchard to ensure our independent label partners have a choice and arent inhibited from the digital distribution partner they prefer simply because they remain tethered to their physical distributor

5480672 pay day is every thursday and if you do not get the minimum amount of work done per hour then a little will be deducted from your pay if you do not work on thursdays then it will be ready for the next time you work i will be here every day from 11 am to 2 p m so this is when you can get your cheque any questions
5480673 so were supposed to get this rock what type is it and put it in those piles is that it
5480674 just leave it in the piles i go to collect them every day
5480675 the schedules are pretty flexible as far as how many days you work but im afraid the only times available are 12 midnight to 4 am
5480676 can i work only a couple times a week and then increase that over the summer
5480677 so diedre why are you working here of all places
5480678 i tried some other places but since i have so many activities after school nowhere would hire me except here and probably mcdonalds i need money to go to this space camp
5480679 i moved out on my own and have another part time job that one pays the bills this one lets me buy some things like a new computer or whatever
5480680 my parents dont really want me to go to art school see
5480681 i know what you mean my parents dont want me to go to this space camp
5480682 were going to have lunch now so if youre awake you can join us
5480683 were going to have lunch now so if youre awake you can join us
5480684 you go sit there on the edge of the hill
5480685 i have one picture left on this roll of film
5480686 you would be seeing the earth from there and the armies would be nothing more than people fighting other people for something that doesnt belong to any of them
5480687 um i have some extra clothes that i dont want and i was wondering if you would want it
5480688 why did you come home so soon is everything ok where is your luggage
5480689 i couldnt remember anything about the naming of alkanes and stuff
5480690 thats like all i studied how do you think you did
5480691 i cant believe were done grade ten were finished our first year or high school
5480692 and i wont be back here till the year after next year
5480693 im starting to save up for spending money when i go there apparently theres really good shopping ill bring you back something
5480694 its not really important to the world i dont know why the government spends so much money on it
5480695 i kind of want to go into space but im a little worried about re entry did you know that if there is a little scratch in the heat shield of the shuttle or rocket it could explode while blasting off it is rather dangerous sitting on top of amount of energy involved in rocket of fuel if the scratch occurs while in space then the intense heat of re entry then you could potentially go kaboom you know like columbia did you know that the peak temperature in kelvins during re entry can be approximated by taking the numerical value of the speed in metres per second
5480696 what would you do if there was a problem on the spaceship like that
5480697 id probably get out and try to patch it up then go over all the options of what to do
5480698 id then pull out all the stops if i couldnt come up with a solution call houston even though they are not involved call universities with aerospace engineers and future mission control specialists
5480699 well i guess well just have to make it safe
5480700 my name is mitchell and im going to be your counsellor so to speak at this camp
5480701 gentlemen and lady we are going to show discipline we are going to learn what it takes people a few years to learn normally i personally am going to make sure you work your asses off and are all the better for it
5480702 first we will choose teams of people everyone who wants to fly in the spaceship will be assigned a team to work with in the next three months we will be concentrating on flying planes and i will drill you all in knowledge about space flight and we will do a few emergency simulations after that over christmas and in the winter we will be concentrating more on space flight simulating it especially take off and re entry in june we are going to lift off and go into space
5480703 now if you would just follow me we need to get to the camp site where we will be until the end of november and it gets too cold
5480704 its not too late to back out now we have five more hours of walking until we get there
5480705 thats counting a half hour stop for lunch at 12 oclock
5480706 when we arrive sons and daughters well build our home on the water
5480707 were almost there its quite hidden from view but the camp is just beyond those few trees its off the beaten path so to speak because the beaten path leads that a way
5480708 all the cabins have two bathrooms and in the co ed cabins
5480709 one will be for girls the other for boys now i need five volunteers for cabin a
5480710 there are a few things we do here that are not rocket science and finding your cabin is one of them
5480711 guys when im done you can use my bathroom i dont mind
5480712 we eat breakfast at 6 oclock lunch at 12 supper at 18 hours we also have a break at 10 oclock and 15 oclock before bed we will have fruit salad from our never ending supply of fruit salad
5480713 its all on a handout i am going to give you
5480714 anyway on with the business many of you may have noticed that there are no showers in the cabins not enough water pressure so everyone will take turns and bathe in the waterfall which is down that path lights out is 21 30 because you will have to be up for breakfast at six am
5480715 i am going to divide you into groups and these are the groups you will train with if you do not want to go into space you will still have to do the simulations
5480716 are group 3 also known as the crew you have to learn everything but no pressure
5480717 and you people are mission control and the main designers of the ship
5480718 just so you know you arent technically supposed to fly these until you get your flying license so you know keep it on the down low
5480719 and you wont get your flying license at the end of this camp even though youll be more than capable especially if you are on the crew
5480720 as you can see the wind is blowing in the opposite direction than we are taking off its good flying conditions today
5480721 if you were to be told you needed more delta v name one thing you would ask to be clarified before doing a correction burn
5480722 good ernest what angle of re entry are such that the ship does not bounce off the atmosphere but has a long enough time travelling through thin atmoshpere so it doesnt burn up
5480723 that wont help you when youre coming in too steep and are going to burn up in the atmosphere its ideal angle of re entry matthew what would you do if one of the thrusters not the one in the middle gave out
5480724 im going to be in mission control sir not flying the thing
5480725 right you are but what are you going to tell them to do
5480726 hi honey how are you settling in you didnt call us yesterday
5480727 sorry i didnt think of it i was busy getting everything organized and getting used to the new place and people
5480728 oh yes a couple of the girls in my dormitory were already friends before they came here
5480729 but this other girl is really nice and very interested in art she said she is going to draw all of us in manga style
5480730 well im glad to see youre having a nice time there were looking forward to seeing you at christmas
5480731 a lot of people stay here for christmas and i heard they have excellent plays and concerts around then
5480732 ill make you a christmas card and ill call you
5480733 is using artificially induced gravity to well simulate the way it will be in the spaceship for the first few times i will not be touching any of the controls but then later on in a few days time maybe i am going to simulate emergency situations
5480734 and then i have a book for you all explaining from an astronauts perspective a flight into orbit
5480735 and another thing with these radio things you have to say
5480736 now everyone prepare yourselves for the g forces involved make sure you keep breathing the simulation shuttle is equipped with barf bags which are located up on the wall somewhere you can get those when we simulate the zero gravity section
5480737 we are at t minus 60 seconds and counting down
5480738 youre in virtual spaceflight now lady and gentlemen all systems are nominal
5480739 feel free to take off your seatbelts and float around a bit grab a barf bag if you need it enjoy being weightless you have an hour of this in which time i will teach you the controls
5480740 my first time in a simulator well thats another story
5480741 its hard to believe that we are going to be up there
5480742 i cant believe im finally getting to go on a spaceship
5480743 the food is good the teachers are good youre comfortable and not homesick
5480744 would you like me to send you something anything youve forgotten dear
5480745 actually no mom surprisingly i didnt forget anything i triple checked my list before i came here and it paid off i cant think of anything i would need
5480746 if you really want to send me anything you could send me an e card or something we have free wireless internet but not much time to use it there are so many school activities
5480747 and thats so wonderful youre involved in activities what sorts of activities
5480748 just make sure it doesnt inspire you to be an astronaut
5480749 um well theres also soccer just for fun there arent any competitions
5480750 and a couple incredibly nerdy things like chess club and i was in book club but they discontinued it
5480751 okay darling but you know we can always get you more minutes for your phone
5480752 im a little in the dark about what boarding school is like the only information i have is what my sister has said and what ive read in books
5480753 it was horribly prim and prissy and i didnt like it much but maybe i could help you with some of the finer details
5480754 there was an explosion on the launch pad it was the fault of nobody just something went wrong
5480755 her daughter is twenty four now just finished her pharmacy degree advocating for rainforests in chile at this moment her adopted son is twenty two and she is okay with him doing an aerospace engineering degree
5480756 back in the sim lets see if you can do it this time
5480757 a plane with balloons is that going to mess up the aerodynamics
5480758 a christmas cake a couple books and gloves and a hat
5480759 you eat it as a thank you for getting the parcel to begin with
5480760 and i have one last favor to ask you im going to be coming back in june the same time julien comes back and ill need the other stuff to bring home and ill give you some money i feel bad asking you for the favor
5480761 well dear i hope you had a nice new years

5480764 oh my laws i am going to have to phone her
5480765 anyway ive got to go i have a big test tomorrow and need to study
5480766 this is tom and he is going to be the captain of the ship
5480767 when i bought this ship with the last of the money left to me by my filthy rich and stingy great uncle
5480768 i had them take out most of the bunks and put in a place where we could hook up a simulator tansey went back to get that and should be here any minute once we get it hooked up there well be ready to go
5480769 youll have to show me pictures when you get home
5480770 my polaroid camera broke so i bought a new one and the roll was almost done when this stupid buck toothed girl opened up the back of it moron
5480771 well im sure youll get lots of nice pictures of your friends from now until the end well put more money in your bank account for you and you can go shopping for a digital camera
5480772 but youre a friend i dont think of you in that way
5480773 im only joking we can read each others minds here at space camp you should have known that
5480774 this baby cost what the heck is the price of a rocket certainly less than 20 million lets round it to the nearest it is 32000 dollars which you all helped pay for
5480775 so why does it cost the russians 30 million to send people into space
5480776 they have to pay mission control were all more like volunteers
5480777 and they have a monopole on the market for now and need money for their space program so theyre doing what any good capitalist would do making a profit
5480778 and i got tansey mccartheys cell phone number for you
5480779 do not take your gear off strap yourselves back in we have a slight problem do you copy
5480780 eject everything else off the re entry vehicle youre falling you arent going to stay in space

5480795 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5480796 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5480797 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5480798 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5480799 signs of not getting enough sleep or sleeping poorly include consistently taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep awakening more than a few times or for long periods each night feeling sleepy during the day or having trouble concentrating at school or at work

5480803 with every penny of pell grants needed for students it was inexcusable for the federal government to be providing any money to sex offenders
5480804 the elimination of this loophole in the pell grant program that had allowed convicted child predators to receive federal financial aid to take college courses is a welcome development for taxpayers and the higher education system
5480805 some institutions report that sex offenders are putting the financial aid to questionable uses by buying such things as clothes a dvd player and music cds sometimes after they have dropped out of school pell grants can legally be put toward expenses that are education related but the unused portion of a grant is supposed to be repaid when someone withdraws from school
5480806 rep keller deserves the thanks of every taxpayer for fighting to include his provision in h r 4137 he has been working diligently to eliminate pell grants for sex offenders for many years and his hard work has finally paid off

5480831 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5480832 this is really a young man who has fallen into that stereotype of a rather sad and lonely teenager who spends too much time in a darkened room in front of a computer screen
5480833 he has not had much life experience to get himself mature
5480834 if anyone thinks he can kill our citizens without being punished or kill our soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers we will never allow this
5480835 we are talking about pulling back to the territory of south ossetia there should be no troops on the territory of georgia
5480836 we used to have there one light infantry battalion less than 600 people certainly it will be more soldiers but not just soldiers the force must be credible to prevent any further escalation of conflict there
5480837 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries
5480838 to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5480839 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential for britains security never mind the personal ties that bind nearly one million british people to pakistan that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5480840 in this context the musharraf years yielded significant dividends notably in the economic field but also until last autumn in areas like media freedom
5480841 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5480842 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme
5480843 we will also continue to deepen our security co operation with the new government and we will be clear about the essential nature of a new partnership between pakistan and afghanistan
5480844 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5480845 there has been a deepening of uk pakistan relations we wish him mr musharraf well in the future
5480846 our relations are not dependent on one individual we support any measures which support democracy and the rule of law
5480847 a strong friend of britain and a crucial ally against the spread of terrorism
5480848 britain should give pakistan strong support in promoting the economic and social development of their country and building on the dialogue with india over kashmir
5480849 its properly elected politicians must now be given the space free from interference from the military to restore good governance in the country
5480850 i welcome the fact that this is the culmination of the restoration of democracy in pakistan

5480908 when i first started in the industry all your advertising and your lead generation would be done through newspapers and magazines travel amp leisure outside magazine the new york times
5480909 and youd spend a lot of money to advertise in those magazines to get a very low return
5480910 you can spend significantly less and get a whole lot more eyeballs looking at your web site and hopefully ones that are interested in doing your kinds of trips
5480911 when we first launched our site in 1998 our net was rather wide
5480912 and because of that we got a lot of fish in the net that really werent qualified to do our trips for example we would get people getting married and planning a honeymoon and older people without kids so over the years what weve done is refine the site through pictures and the wording as a result the number of visitors continues to go up but the number of leads hasnt that substantially but were getting more qualified leads

5480941 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5480942 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5480943 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5480944 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5480945 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5480946 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5480947 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5480948 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5480949 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5480950 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5480951 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls

5480964 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0
5480965 will give developers a chance to build polished applications once hardware is available
5480966 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5480967 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0
5480968 we know that these changes will affect many developers who have worked with the prior early looks at the sdk and we are very sorry for the resulting inconvenience
5480969 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform

5480976 its ludicrous to even think that we would put him on the field and put our football team in harms way
5480977 net zoals mijn drie broers zij zitten ook allemaal nog in het kermisvak ieder met een eigen attractie
5480978 onze twee dochters willen de zaak niet overnemen ze hebben allebei vriendjes die niet uit het kermisleven komen en die zien het niet zitten onze zoon chris is pas tien dus die kan het stokje voorlopig niet overnemen als hij het al zou willen
5480979 de kinderen krijgen van ons een weekkaart voor de sjimmy we zijn hier meestal om een uur of twee om vijf uur gaan we even naar huis om te eten en dan komen we hier terug tot een uur of elf s avonds
5480980 was de plek waar stiekem werd gevree n er zijn daar heel wat huwelijken gesloten nu gebeurt dat niet meer tegenwoordig vinden ze het hier leuk totdat ze een jaar of twaalf zijn terwijl wij hier vroeger op ons zestiende nog steeds kwamen
5480981 tienduizend lampjes zitten erin zeven motoren bijna alle onderdelen van de attractie van de bewegende bruggen tot de trappen zijn nog origineel en alles is tiptop in orde zo wil ik het ook hebben dat vind ik belangrijk maar mijn vrouw vindt soms dat ik te perfectionistisch ben
5480982 nee het is niet meer zo leuk als vroeger alles is zo schreeuwend duur geworden brandstof verzekeringen stageld voor elektriciteit alleen ben ik al duizend euro per week kwijt
5480983 vroeger spaarden kinderen een jaar lang voor die ene week kermis nu moeten we concurreren met de mobiele telefoon merkkleding en wat al niet meer ieder weekend is er wel iets te doen ze komen gewoon niet meer vanzelfsprekend naar jou
5480984 het opbouwen en afbouwen gaat allemaal met de hand en het moet altijd snel snel snel want het moet in een paar maanden verdiend worden de ene avond sta je nog in venlo de volgende ochtend ben je alweer aan het opbouwen ergens in het westen van brabant
5480985 nee makkelijk is het allemaal niet ik maak me er echt zorgen over

5480991 at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoe laces and bad handwriting
5480992 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch
5480993 the main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value
5480994 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5480995 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5480996 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5480997 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5480998 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5480999 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5481000 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5481001 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5481002 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5481003 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5481004 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5481005 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
5481006 let us make man in our image in our likeness
5481007 it was also in may 1969 that they wanted me to write as i remember a letter to u s pilots who were flying over north vietnam asking them not to do it i was being forced to stand up continuously sometimes theyd make you stand up or sit on a stool for a long period of time id stood up for a couple of days with a respite only because one of the guards the only real human being that i ever met over there let me lie down for a couple of hours while he was on watch the middle of one night
5481008 after one difficult interrogation i was left in the interrogation room for the night tied in ropes a gun guard whom i had noticed before but had never spoken to was working the night shift 10 00 p m to 4 a m a short time after the interrogators had left me to ponder my bad attitude for the evening this guard entered the room and silently without looking at or smiling at me loosened the ropes and then he left me alone a few minutes before his shift ended he returned and tightened up the ropes
5481009 one christmas a few months after the gun guard had inexplicably come to my assistance during my long night in the interrogation room i was standing in the dirt courtyard when i saw him approach me he walked up and stood silently next to me again he didnt smile or look at me he just stared at the ground in front of us after a few moments had passed he rather nonchalantly used his sandaled foot to draw a cross in the dirt we both stood wordlessly looking at the cross until after a minute or two he rubbed it out and walked away
5481010 i saw my good samaritan often after the christmas when we venerated the cross together but he never said a word to me nor gave the slightest signal that he acknowledged my humanity
5481011 obviamente que quer amos que o assunto ja estivesse resolvido mas com a chegada do novo treinador e com a entrada e sa da de jogadores ainda n o houve tempo

5481016 they are working shifts and they are rushed off their feet i havent seen them since they started working there last month
5481017 i talked to one of the chinese practitioners before we arrived mostly focusing on sleep disturbances and other types of imbalances
5481018 that does not fall within the realm of conventional medicine
5481019 i am sorry i missed our appointment today i was driving my daughter to day care when she opened an umbrella in the back seat hitting me in the back of the head with it this shocked me so much i drove off the road and hit a tree i am now at the hospital and may be released by tomorrow morning

5481021 evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed

5481026 im sorry i couldnt wait you were all so beautiful
5481027 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5481028 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5481029 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble
5481030 these people guest workers certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5481031 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands in tax breaks for people earning 2 5 million because theyre only middle class
5481032 everyone making 2 5 million or more raise your hands
5481033 i think if youre just talking about income how about five million
5481034 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5481035 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5481036 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5481037 this guy obviously does not pump his own gas he obviously does not do his own shopping he obviously does not pay his own bills
5481038 but american politics is never that easy weve got to work hard weve got to earn this election
5481039 hes done so much he cant fit everything on one resume
5481040 when i first heard the track i admit that it took me a little time to get into some of the songs vocals however over the past few weeks ive started to warm up to them and really get into the entire production an interesting side note to this song is that it was produced
5481041 but you know what sugar does to you wouldnt you rather eat something sugar free and healthy
5481042 oh no you dont wanna watch that one its too old for you and its gory why dont you watch this one
5481043 if i let you watch it do you promise not to tell your mummy
5481044 dont lie to me now im going to ask you again and this time i expect a truthful answer
5481045 either you tell me right now or therell be no tv for a month
5481046 i shouldve known youd do something like this one day
5481047 alien was running rampant torchwood ops shot it alien blew up blue gunk flew everywhere had to retcon a few witnesses
5481048 i babysat aria whilst you were working like you asked me to
5481049 she hasnt managed to get the bread knife off the side again and decapitate joey with it has she
5481050 mines asleep and dreaming hows the second one coming along
5481051 do you think im going to save you from the nasty raspberries nina
5481052 shes going to be a starving time baby were clear out of bananas
5481053 you dont want nasty old raspberries anyway do you nina
5481054 i know bananas are good and all but id like her to have something else in her diet
5481055 she needs the potassium its very important for the development of neuron functions including brain patterns and nerve reactions as well as a load of other things the more bananas she eats the better for her brain
5481056 if anyone could it would be nina being a clever time baby and all that if she wont eat anything in this kitchen then i cant exactly keep her fed
5481057 youve managed to wean her in the last two hours
5481058 read him a chapter on temporal abnormalities in complex ecosystems and he was straight out
5481059 when you put him down you can read him stories about bunnies in gardens when i put him down we lay the building blocks of a temporal education which will help him pilot the tardis someday
5481060 children sleep in order to process the information they learn whilst awake mmm raspberries
5481061 good i like raspberries too much to share almost as good as bananas they are
5481062 so duck tell me which youd rather a pretty story about ducks and foxes with mummy or a scary time lord list with lots of long words with dad
5481063 we like you just fine and nina wants you to listen to the story too
5481064 who was annoyed because the farmers wife would not let her hatch her own eggs
5481065 traveling through space wanting sheep even has a rose in it
5481066 prissy flower wrapped in a glass cage not much better than cotton wool if you ask me
5481067 of course he does die at the end suicide by snake nasty way to go i suppose no one dies in a beatrix potter book especially not one about foxes and ducklings wouldnt do at all
5481068 so ninety minutes with nothing to do and no children to watch tell me rose tyler what would you like to do
5481069 ninety minutes children asleep no cloister bells no guests aboard i think theres only one thing we can do in this circumstance
5481070 obviously we need to repair the damaged strut in the console room
5481071 chin up you said you needed help to do it and ive got ninety child free minutes with your guarantee that horrid crack has been hurting the tardis we ought to repair it before she gets worse and deposits us somewhere entirely inappropriate
5481072 i was thinking elizabethan england actually but yes those would be bad too
5481073 i told you ill take you back there any time you like as long as its after elizabeth is dead
5481074 you have to go back sometime martha said that elizabeth knew you in 1588 too youve got to go back and actually meet her
5481075 no janie no need to go to elizabeth ergo sic qui i will not go
5481076 you look silly spouting latin when you arent wearing glasses
5481077 to repair the strut you have children i have jack tardis is repaired the hour is ours and i get what i want

5481085 there was once a giant robot and even though he was very big he was very kind and friendly to everyone he met but he didnt get to meet many people because his owners werent kind at all and kept him locked away
5481086 no its not and worse than that they made him steal parts to make a gun that makes people disappear when you shoot them
5481087 his creator made him so he would always do what he was told by his owners but it was all right because there was a clever girl called sarah
5481088 and she worked out what sort of gun the stolen parts could make and she went in search of them when she found the giant robot she felt sorry for him because it wasnt his fault but his owners found her and kidnapped her
5481089 they took her to their underground lair and tied her up but not very well so she ran away as soon as she could
5481090 the robots owners sent him after her and told him to kill her but because shed been so nice to him he didnt want to so then he was confused about who to obey while he was confused he picked up the gun and shot his owners making them disappear
5481091 he was very upset about it but sarah knew it was an accident and she told everyone so they all knew not to blame the robot and he lived happily ever after

5481118 i think it would be better if the guy bitten by the zombie were to be an anti hero type of character like the hulk and became a menace to society
5481119 and because the transformation takes place over the entirely of the movie we could start it slowly say with one murder then as the transformation escalates theres more violence more animalistic behavior and more distance between his original human state

5481233 i went to new zealand as soon as i graduated because of rugby i came here to ut because of rugby so its really become my entire life
5481234 it taught me a lot things about personal responsibility about decision making under pressure the pride and the comraderie of the sport i wanted to give back
5481235 especially for ut when we go to the sweet 16 they play on international fields whereas we play on smaller fields so now we dont have to make that adjustment
5481236 its important to note we are funding the park and theres no county money involved
5481237 ill be inviting more people to see the new field and hopefully get some more people into rugby

5481242 somebody has published a paper linking coffee or caffeine with just about every disease known to man
5481243 it may be that caffeine can simultaneously trigger some that are going to encourage weight gain and others that encourage loss
5481244 an addictive drug is something you commit a crime for
5481245 caffeine is a substance of dependence not a drug of addiction
5481246 the words drug and addiction are powerfully emotive nobody robs banks or commits murder for caffeine
5481247 for women who are pregnant its not a great sacrifice
5481248 probably coffee is a mild antidepressant and for some people its just enough to pull them back from the brink
5481249 itll be 15 or 20 more years before we nail these things down
5481250 many people think of coffee as a caffeine delivery vehicle but in coffee there are probably 2000 other chemicals

5481547 bringing new characters into such an established piece as csi requires i think a lot of thought and consideration you have to consider not just the folks that work on the show but the audience and a number of things
5481548 his background is more than just being a college professor
5481549 the character were creating has a background as a medical doctor as a research pathologist in fact and for a number of reasons the backstorys going to get revealed over the course of the season he has been forced out of that career and has become sort of a college lecturer sort of an itinerant college professor and hes teaching a course in criminalistics when he gets involved in an investigation with the csis sort of the ground floor qualification is a background in science or pathology and thats what brings him in the door
5481550 our internal code name for this character is the professor
5481551 i think it was misreported a little bit in terms of this character having the genetic makeup of a serial killer because in reality there is no such thing
5481552 what we really want to play with in a dramatic sense is a character who has been able to examine his own genetic profile to a certain extent and find certain complexes and clusters of biological facts that are associated with aggressiveness and criminal behavior and thats all it is
5481553 its just one of the things thats going to lead this character to be interested in the world of violent criminals and criminalistics and forensics its just what draws him to it
5481554 if you see within yourself certain tendencies it lets you wonder about how these things turn into murder how they turn into violence how they turn into criminal behavior and thats all it is its an underlying element for the character nothing as simple as hes got the genes of a serial killer because there is no such thing
5481555 to be perfectly frank i said to naren and carol when we met here in new york i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them
5481556 but im happy to say the episodes they sent me to look at were really really engaging and really really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive actually been involved in and i thought wow that is cool mmm thisll work so im excited

5481589 president musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaida the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world
5481590 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation

5481601 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaida and extremist groups
5481602 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges that they face
5481603 the decision by president musharraf will now open up the possibility for the new government to act more decisively on issues facing it and i think that will allow the united states to work in closer cooperation in the weeks ahead
5481604 the fight against these kinds of groups that are interested in attacking the united states or our allies or friends around the world is a fight that was much larger than musharraf as an individual and required institutional changes within the pakistani army intelligence and also at the civilian level among the civilian political leaders to address the rising tide of extremism throughout the country
5481605 with musharraf out of the way it actually provides an opportunity now for the united states to distance itself to some extent so that if the military and the civilian government can agree on a policy which i think inevitably is going to have to be a more aggressive approach to the extremists it will not be seen as american policy

5481607 toen ik slechts enkele dagen geleden vernam dat mijn boek in het servisch uitkwam was ik onder de indruk beobook een kleine uitgeverij in een land waar zoveel strijd was leek moediger dan random house een van de grootste uitgeverijen van de wereld dachten deze moslims na lezing van mijn boek nu echt dat ik mohammed en aisha heb zwartgemaakt ik deed net het tegendeel mijn bedoeling was om deze grote historische figuren te vieren en om misverstanden over de islam de wereld uit te helpen

5481610 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5481611 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5481612 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5481613 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5481617 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5481618 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5481619 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5481620 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5481621 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme

5481647 i use the bis monitor for a lot more than just preventing awareness i like knowing how deeply anesthetized my patients are not just that they are unaware how much a patient is unaware as a continuum is a lot more important that the binary notion of awake vs asleep i do this with a bis monitor and could do the same with hospiras psa monitor and make lots of decisions based on it and i think provide better care for the effort my reasons for saying this follow
5481648 there are important differences in the neural substrates mediating induction and emergence
5481649 orexinergic neurons play a critical role in promotion and maintenance of wakefulness
5481650 neural substrates governing transitions into and out of the anesthetized state need not be identical that induction and emergence from anesthesia are not mirror opposite processes

5481679 were trying to minimise the impact to the travelling public thats why were holding it in the intra peak period
5481680 we want to make sure that we get people to work and the kids to school and then well be back on the job ready to get people home from work and take the kids home from schools
5481681 living in the city people find they barely need a car
5481682 they can walk to work walk to the shops but there are times when they need a car to visit friends or visit the country and this is a great way of saving money and saving our environment too
5481683 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5481684 you dont pass that sort of legislation unless theres some sort of intent to use it
5481685 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate
5481686 continues to exceed our regulatory capital requirements we continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle
5481687 its just before an election maybe elections force action much needed action on climate change
5481688 its a very important piece of legislation because this government came to office saying it would be open and accountable and talked about freedom of information reform
5481689 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5481690 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5481691 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5481692 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5481693 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5481694 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5481695 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one
5481696 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class
5481697 i dont think people would be willing to risk side effects if they knew that the aim of a clinical trial was to boost profits for a pharmaceutical company
5481698 i would think that at some level this is standard practice
5481699 morneaus bat finally coming back around lets hope kubel gets it going in this series too

5481750 il y en a dans presque toutes les villes maintenant seulement dans certaines elles ne sont pas toutes aussi structur es encore
5481751 mix ups between morphine and hydromorphone are the most common and potentially serious errors that can occur involving two high alert drugs this risk exists in almost every facility in pennsylvania assume that this error will eventually happen in your facility
5481752 the budget is balanced right now but we had to bring down the budget to 35 million we had 60 million in cuts
5481753 we began planning two years ago and we didnt make foolish expenditures
5481754 our district revenues have declined about 60 million over the last year however our financial planning strategy and efforts to contain costs have our school district well positioned to survive these tough economic times
5481755 neighboring school districts are struggling with multi year salary commitments and skyrocketing health insurance costs these commitments have forced many school districts to layoff employees in order to balance the budget salaries and benefits comprise 80 percent of school district budgets on average in these times any salary or benefit increase likely necessitates and offsetting reduction in force our strategy remains to protect jobs and weather the economic downturn together
5481756 state funding cuts reduced the 2008 district budget by 25 million for 2009 the legislature further reduced our revenue by an additional 34 4 million on top of that some local revenue sources including interest earnings are down another 7 2 million so the total revenue decrease is 41 6 million
5481757 we also have some rising costs to contend with such as opening three new elementary schools and rising fuel and utility costs
5481758 were looking at a 95 million shortfall and were down 2 2 billion from last years operating budget which does not include construction projects
5481759 instead of three secretaries now there may be two in the front offices the phones may ring three times longer
5481760 if any one of the amendments pass we will literally become a third world country education system
5481761 any one of the amendments would have a financial impact
5481762 florida is already funded 50th in the nation for public education if the amendments are passed where will the money come from
5481763 the sales tax is up to the people and i hope they pass amendment 5 the legislature will decide on what source they will use to replace the current property tax funding i believe amendment 5 will stimulate the economy and bring 12 billion in increased revenue to the state
5481764 how do i trust legislature to fill the gap for children of the state when the people who make the decisions about the money in the state of florida are not child friendly
5481765 but if the legislature keeps cutting us we have to look for ways to save money and our back is to the wall

5481772 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5481773 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5481774 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5481775 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5481776 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5481777 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5481778 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5481779 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5481780 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5481781 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5481782 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5481783 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5481784 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5481785 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5481786 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5481787 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5481788 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5481789 if she had nothing shed find something to give you
5481790 to wake up feeling like in a movie gunfire this is the united states not iran
5481791 the parents need to start telling on kids you know kids got guns you need to tell on them save their life another life
5481792 i feel like parents should be responsible for what they birth from womb to tomb thats it
5481793 this unacceptable were not having it stand with them were going to stop it
5481794 if community takes care of it it will lead to more violence
5481795 random house made the decision to cancel its us publication of the novel the jewel of medina after much deliberation and with great reluctance
5481796 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5481797 this is a work that absolutely stopped at nothing in order to desecrate something that all muslims hold sacred
5481798 firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some
5481799 however we must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided not to go forward with this publication out of concerns for the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
5481800 womens empowerment never a popular theme among fundamentalists of any faith
5481801 given the respect with which i treat the muslim prophet however i never expected to be killed because of it i still dont
5481802 adjust your radios im fin to school ya yeah im a youngin yo but im about to move ya promise
5481803 this devout man used considerable force upon himself clearly causing injuries and causing others present to fear for his safety to such an extent that they started to intervene and calm him down
5481804 the prosecution say the defendant ignored the advice given to him that this practice was not allowed for children under 16 years of age
5481805 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
5481806 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5481807 your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success
5481808 they are choosing individuals who would have evidence for good development which means that maybe their offspring would be more healthy and have good development as well
5481809 we can confirm emmanuel has signed a new long term contract with the club
5481810 i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
5481811 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family

5481814 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5481815 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5481816 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5481817 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5481818 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5481819 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5481820 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5481821 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship

5481835 sooner or later i had confidence that our bats could explode
5481836 its really a matter of us wanting to win this world series no matter what regardless of the rival
5481837 we know that we have to face these teams eventually so we have to prepare ourselves to try to win the whole thing
5481838 usually one minute and 30 seconds is good but we have to make sure its under two minutes no matter what
5481839 its a pure sand field and underneath it theres drain pipes
5481840 its all hooked up to suction pumps when the tarp dumps it thats where it goes and it moves the water out very quickly
5481841 weve done it a lot of years were very experienced and we know what were doing
5481842 on conversions were here all night long until the sun comes up in the morning
5481843 we can turn the field over from one sport to the other in 24 hours we do it quite often it takes a couple hundred workers drains forklifts and everybody has different jobs
5481844 its a coordinated effort with a bunch of people that just through experience we get it done
5481845 norm sherry came over and told me i might as well make the baseball hall of fame
5481846 and sure enough i threw a no hitter and its at the hall of fame
5481847 but at the time i didnt realize what the devil it was until after i retired
5481848 you always want your kids to do better than you do and jaret had a 10 year major league career its always good to see your kids on tv
5481849 people ask me if it bothers me that saunders might break my record but i tell them that doesnt bother me
5481850 but i got a record that no one can break i threw the first no hitter at angel stadium and that cant happen again
5481851 hes treating it just like he would during a normal game week and the push to saturday
5481852 thats an important part of it guys dont always feel chipper the first part of the week when they get dinged up but they find a way to push to saturday thats how hes approaching the thing thats how were approaching the thing to play in saturdays game
5481853 ive had it the last two months but its getting worse
5481854 this has been a good year i want to keep it going
5481855 i talked to randy yesterday he admitted he could use a break
5481856 we are on a schedule for the schematic design of the building to be done by the end of august
5481857 we have renderings ready and we have packets available for the media the public and our season ticket holders and our employees but we are just being respectful to the judge
5481858 we are not releasing them until she rules on the public purpose count
5481859 schematic design is literally a picture and designs of every single room in the building
5481860 so there is about a 40 page program statement that has every detail in writing you match that against the actual designs that hok does
5481861 lawsuit or not we are moving full speed ahead on the design side
5481862 the delay still is on the document side but this past week i had a long meeting with george burgess i continue to speak with mayor diaz on a consistent basis and we are beginning to schedule some get togethers as we move the documents forward
5481863 we are hoping for that as soon as possible but we dont have a date
5481864 its our hope that it will happen soon and we want to be in position to move quickly once that decision comes
5481865 we have not seen or heard of a stadium that does not serve a public purpose
5481866 so we feel very confident that we will prevail but its up to the judge
5481867 again this the new stadium is something that is important to the county and the city because its something that adds both economically and in so many other ways to the county of miami dade and really to all of south florida
5481868 first the economic impact of the building both during construction and afterwards and also an economic impact you cant measure which is having a major league baseball team and the amount of media exposure you get with having a major league baseball team
5481869 thats going to add a 25 million economic impact right there
5481870 that impact would not be around if it were not for the florida marlins
5481871 were working nonstop we need to get these documents done and this lawsuit behind us so we can move forward with all the exciting things that come with building a stadium
5481872 plastic plus hot plus fat is the worst combination thats because most chemicals that leach from plastic are lipophilic they love fat and temperature speeds up the leaching process into the fat

5481926 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5481927 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5481928 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5481935 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5481936 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5481937 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane

5481951 what people are saying is that were born with a capacity to represent numbers approximately but not exactly our work challenges that idea
5481952 the most important thing is that indigenous people ran the tests it is very difficult to get good data from indigenous groups unless you have people in the community
5481953 its not just that these cultures lack the words for numbers they just dont count things

5481984 besides this ridiculously overblown lawsuit we are having one of the most inspiring wonderful and exciting times that weve experienced to date
5481985 as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5481986 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5481987 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void

5482010 were finally coming back around to ideas that were around before the corporate franchise was shown to be a failure
5482011 so much money was being spent to push the corporate model that it was all cities heard about there was no pr or marketing for community wireless groups but unlike the corporations their focus has always been maximizing the public good
5482012 i firmly believe that every public access tv operation every community radio station every nonprofit community technology center can be doing this
5482013 its not rocket science all of those technology based nonprofits are strapped for revenue weve got to figure out a way to capture some of those digital dollars that are falling out of our communities and this is it
5482014 having the city itself as the anchor tenant gives the provider an incentive to set up a good network
5482015 from the get go theres a set amount of money philadelphia never had that deal san francisco never had that deal
5482016 if a private company decides they just arent going to do it anymore the community is stuck because its privately owned
5482017 if its publicly owned and the network is not going exactly as planned they can decide if its still worth it for their police officers to have access if its still worth it to have inspectors and social workers be able to enter their data remotely if its still worth it for citizens to be able to connect anywhere they can ask those questions and decide whether its good for the community or not
5482018 u s internet is not investing in a mobile handset project and trying to still provide dsl service and outsourcing their customer service to india this is their main project

5482021 universal affordable access for broadband technology by the year 2007
5482022 we have a failure on the national level thats too important to ignore
5482023 not to view broadband as a strategic asset is a significant shortcoming the other leading countries of the world do view broadband in that light and they are thinking about how to get more of it at much faster speeds and lower rates because its a platform for so many other things that are important
5482024 is make sure that communities that want to solve their own problems that want to build the network they need can do that
5482025 if we open up the unused spaces between the television channels it suddenly becomes possible to deploy the network that we need at a quarter of the cost
5482026 as president i will set a simple goal every american should have the highest speed broadband access no matter where you live or how much money you have well connect schools libraries and hospitals and well take on special interests to unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safety and connectivity
5482027 we need to start looking at this as an infrastructure issue rather than as a business
5482028 we dont ask cities and towns to cost justify bringing in fresh water and having a sewer system when we could outsource it to private companies nobody says why should my town compete with the private water market i can get perrier why should i have water we treat water as a utility we do the same thing with electricity we have to take the same attitude here toward broadband

5482053 what i didnt realize is that public security has arrested at least a half dozen people who have shown up to apply for protest permits public security is pretty shrewd in the old days it had to go out and catch protesters in the act now it saves itself the bother would be protesters show up at public security offices to apply for permits and are promptly detained thats cost effective law enforcement for you

5482085 what is the role of evaluation in your critical work
5482086 the last thing i want to know is whether you like it or not the problems of writing are after that i dont think it has any importance its one of those derelict appendages of criticism criticism has nothing to do with hierarchies
5482087 hold on honey while i ring this up on my jewish organ
5482088 fifty bucks do you know how many years willy poster and i worked on that sturges piece
5482089 can be entered at any point without hierarchy center or horizon line
5482090 impossible to tell from the beginning of an essay on a film or a filmmaker where it is going to end up there is no thesis no antithesis no possibility of synthesis in part because the need to get it all in works against the more traditional critical ambition to say everything about a work by constructing a microcosmic model that includes by definition everything that can be said
5482091 among the notes i am struggling to integrate in this article is the uneasy question why does the big rock in the lower right quadrant look like a pickle its doubtful that any kind of critical study can answer that kind of question but farbers essays make abundant use of these enigmatic details which function as foreign bodies parodies of critical remarks banana peels for the argument
5482092 its like trying to find a friend in a stadium
5482093 whats really disgusting about taxi driver is not the multi faced loner but the endless propaganda about the magic of guns
5482094 the relationship between autobiography and film criticism is both intricate and unavoidable yet the rules of social etiquette governing this delicate connection which require a suppression of autobiography in most marketplace criticism practiced by writers less well known than pauline kael or gore vidal keep it in relative obscurity considering farbers own precise sense of his position in relation to both film criticism and painting it seems understandable that only the relative obscurity and hermeticism of his paintings would permit a comfortable adoption of the autobiographical mode the relative exposure of his film writing combined with its rhetorical strategies make this tactic seem less tenable in print
5482095 a master of critics patter the numbers racket and the false bracket
5482096 the whole chapter with its extraordinary associational processes comes very close at times to stream of consciousness and is worth looking up as an example of what you can get away with with a bit of swagger such impressionism says as much about farbers assumptions about his readers as it does about his own perceptions and his way of experiencing films it is assumed that they will not know the films very well either but will not feel this as much of a handicap in attending to discussions of them so vague as to be unchallengeable
5482097 you know im not someone who ever survived the depression its not the sort of experience you ever really get over
5482098 and one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or senator obama
5482099 as you saw with the surge and as you see even before this crisis broke out he said last year weve got a problem we should be thinking about having russia be disinvited from the g 8
5482100 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war and clearly thats not what we want and john sometimes hes a good person but
5482101 i think barack obama has consistently demonstrated superior judgment to senator mccain on a whole host of national security issues
5482102 whether to go into iraq or not barack obama was correct how to get out of iraq the iraqis embrace barack obamas position even george bush is coming around
5482103 he was right about afghanistan finally john mccain is coming around on that he was right about engaging iran george bush has come around on that and he was right about georgia months ago he was calling for this conflict to be diffused instead the president and john mccain are so obsessed with iraq we dropped the ball if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today
5482104 barack obama has consistently demonstrated the kind of judgment that we want in a commander in chief
5482105 hes strong hes cool hes smart thats what we need in these difficult times
5482106 recordemos que harris ya hab a ganado un n mero r cord de campeonatos de parejas en tna ahora es probable que harris se tome como ejemplo dentro de tna para

5482109 i was disappointed and didnt want to let these guys down i know how much they have sacrificed for this one event
5482110 they dont seem to know what the word fear means
5482111 theyre just young kids naive as to what they have achieved theyre going to go out tonight and lap it up until christmas paul manning and i have a bit more sense of how far we have come
5482112 i had a go at it but this was the fourth day in a row to go through race preparation and it was tough
5482113 what they have done here has been incredible but great to watch theyve really made the other countries sit up and think
5482114 does it make any sense to carry on for four more years when you see what the british are doing
5482115 hey bob youre doing great but were going to ask these 1000 people to do your job better and faster
5482116 we need a pepfar presidents emergency plan for aids relief for orphans in world
5482117 i think its something that we should sit down and figure out working between nongovernmental organizations international institutions the us government try to figure out what can we do
5482118 i think you know im often a critic of president bush but i think the pepfar program has saved lives and has done very good work and he deserves enormous credit for that
5482119 we also need to make adoption a lot easier in this country
5482120 thats why so many people now go to other countries to adopt children
5482121 were going to see well over 100 to 200 millimeters of rain in southeast florida

5482157 i received every award from every major veterans organization in america but the reason why i have a perfect voting record from organizations like the veterans of foreign wars the american legion and all the other veterans service organizations is because of my support of them ive been endorsed in every election by all of the veterans organizations that do that ive been supported by them and ive received their highest awards from all of those organizations
5482158 republican presidential candidate sen john mccain appeared tuesday to suggest rationing of veterans health care may be needed so combat veterans can receive the care they deserve
5482159 we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and disabilities that are directly the result of combat
5482160 so heres my idea and its not originated with me but ive consulted with so many others who are here look we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and those disabilities that are directly the result of combat we need to expand our ability to treat ptsd ptsd is going to be tough in this war you know that and we need to treat the combat wounds we need to increase that ability to do so
5482161 these wars are the first to be waged in large numbers by a new generation of brave women but 15 percent of our women soldiers that served on the front lines who walk into a va facility screen positive for military sexual trauma is senator mccain suggesting that we cant afford to give them benefits senator mccains campaign did not return calls for comment about his statement but these are questions he must answer all veterans respect john mccains service if he too respects ours he should not be suggesting that we shortchange our soldiers with non combat injuries who have served with such honor and dignity
5482162 after touring the manchester va medical center va secretary james peake also said he is against giving veterans cards to let them receive treatment at non va facilities
5482163 the bush administration and sen john mccain for that matter initially opposed passage of the legislation which was supported overwhelmingly by both democrats and republicans mccain campaigning last week used language suggesting he supported the bill in fact mccain did not even cast a vote on the final measure for bush and mccain to try to claim credit now for a bipartisan effort they both opposed is a plain attempt to hoodwink the american voter
5482164 under the webb bill veterans would receive maximum educational benefits after 36 months of service and those benefits would be tied to the full cost of public school tuition and expenses in the veterans home state the graham bill would require 12 years of service to garner a maximum benefit of 2 000 per month with increases in that figure tied to the consumer price index critics point out that the cpi has been steadily outpaced by tuition increases
5482165 my proposal and others senator graham senator burn is well place incentives for people to stay in the military

5482169 speedometer forces drivers to divert their eyes from the road
5482170 many dashboard gauges and controls sacrifice functionality for retro style
5482171 it feels even quicker especially compared to the previous coupe
5482172 adequate acceleration but needs to be shifted down a gear or two to maintain speed when driving uphill on the freeway
5482173 despite its modest power numbers the base cooper hatchbacks engine provides more than enough gusto for most buyers
5482174 the turbocharged s model has plenty of power and almost no turbo lag making moot our concerns that the change from a supercharger to a turbocharger would change the character of the car
5482175 the turbocharged version found in the cooper s meanwhile is terrific providing particularly strong acceleration when the special overboost mode is active
5482176 s models with automatic transmission suffer jerky shifts and occasional harshness
5482177 minis well tuned suspension offers a firm but comfortable ride
5482178 suffer a firm choppy ride over anything but glass smooth pavement however only an s with optional 17 inch tires is really harsh over bumps

5482180 the cooper line is much roomier inside than people expect
5482181 those riding in the front seats enjoy excellent head and legroom
5482182 seats are firm and supportive but mounted too low for easy entry and exit
5482183 even those taller than 6 feet will find a comfortable seating position
5482184 with those tall folks up front though rear seat leg space is practically non existent even if headroom is ample
5482185 the audio controls are bunched confusingly into the huge center speedometer and both manual and automatic climate controls are also poorly designed
5482186 both manual and automatic climate controls are also poorly designed
5482187 numerous squeaks and rattles seem to be a 2008 mini cooper has a surprising amount of room in front but a crowded dash and a noisy ride cut into the fun 8 out of 10
5482188 both driver and front passenger are protected by dual stage deployment smart frontal and seat mounted side air bags
5482189 the options list for the mini encourages its customers to customize
5482190 15 inch alloy wheels a selectable sport setting for steering and accelerator response full power accessories with auto up down windows air conditioning leatherette premium vinyl upholstery multicolor mood lighting a tilt telescoping leather wrapped steering wheel a trip computer and a six speaker stereo with cd player and auxiliary audio jack

5482323 the steering has ample boost at low speeds and becomes noticeably tighter on freeway jaunts the chassis and suspension combo softens moderately rough pavement yet it is stiff enough to keep the mkz on an even keel through turns
5482324 not the floaty lincoln of old its taut firmly sprung and pleasant enough to drive a fully independent suspension that makes this the best handling lincoln in a long time
5482325 a good blend of firm control and bump absorption though not as composed overall as the class leader
5482326 around turns the cars steering is smooth and linear and the body rolls slightly but in a progressive predictable manner thats more than acceptable given the mkzs relatively plush ride

5482333 the mkz lincoln cargo area is useful in shape and volume
5482334 ill suited to tall boxes and lined with cheap feeling material

5482371 materials and build quality fully befit the big bucks price tag
5482372 cabin decor is modern and tasteful with quality materials and top notch assembly
5482373 little louder overall and nearly devoid of traditional diesel clatter

5482543 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5482544 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5482545 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5482546 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5482547 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5482548 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved

5482550 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5482551 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5482552 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5482553 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects

5482582 the number of heroin abusers will very likely grow as more abusers of prescription opioids switch to heroin in the face of increasing mexican heroin availability throughout the region
5482583 a lot of the organizations have shifted from larger cities to smaller cities to avoid detection
5482584 their idea is to control the whole economic process of production and distribution
5482585 im talking about distribution as well as the collection of profits money laundering and smuggling money back to mexico
5482586 the u s will begin to see a little of the same conflict that is happening in mexico

5482594 i dont know how hed react if he met me again
5482595 but i can confirm to you that we never tortured him we never tortured any prisoners
5482596 we used to argue about the war about whether it was right or wrong
5482597 he is a very frank man very conservative and very loyal to his country and the american ideal
5482598 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5482599 one would have to assume that its going to be this week
5482600 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5482601 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5482602 day one in nicaragua took place in a dangerous neighborhood of managua
5482603 day two we got the first taste of the love that we were to be surround with for the remainder of the week

5482608 this is why you buy from me rather than my competitor and rather than taking it from me for free
5482609 we decided to give you something very special for free
5482610 this guitar was made in 2005 it has 22 frets you get 2 volume 2 tone and 3 way you get two humbuckers its an sg body style came with a original emilys gig bag and strap
5482611 it sounds pretty good i wasnt used to it but i made some adjustments and it works fine im using a boss gt6 effect into a 300watt marshall cab
5482612 it was set up okay i didnt have to do too much to fix it up the pick ups were okay the bridge was way too high and the streets were atleast a cm off the frettboard it was a hasstle to change that its very light which is the reason i bought it and also the graphic is awesome the graphic is probably the best thing about this whole guitar it is amazing they put these swirly stickers onto the speed knobs and they peal off
5482613 ive played this guitar live but it went out of tune after a few songs so i had to switch guitars the hardware looks okay i usually smash my guitars at performances but i think i might just keep this one super good looking the finnish is lasting pretty good the neck is huge thou way too big i ended up sanding it down and repainting the back of the neck
5482614 overall this guitar is the exact same as the g 310 just way more worth the money its a limited edition its an awesome graphic
5482615 we made the third of kurage this kurage changed 1 0mm into 1 5mm and enlarged the size as a result the illuminance went up too there are 4 types of forms this time i first changed the size of the optical fiber from 1mm to 1 5mm the size of the main body has grown along with it too the size grew and the illuminance went up kurage is composed of optical fiber by bending the optical fiber the whole area is illuminated outside of the immediate area of the light and together they can make very soft light the brightness can be adjusted by the size of the curve
5482616 beautiful things dont have to cost more than ugly ones
5482617 all that separates the product from the object is the distance from the factory to the store and all that separates the object cult to the cult object is the distance from the store to the museum

5482619 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
5482620 you see it was the only workers i could get
5482621 we are here to let the recruits know and the public in general know what the border patrol is doing to these immigrants
5482622 you know the border patrol is coming into their houses at five oclock in the morning breaking down the doors and sending them to detention centers and the families dont know where they are

5482626 the energy of god is described as a could fire light and so forth
5482627 for them these names are not taken away from god in order to avoid attributing them to him but in order to purify the names of their imperfections
5482628 thats what probably makes it so difficult for dale for the starting 11 weve probably got 16 17 guys to choose from
5482629 weve got all sorts of attacking options and its nice to see it hasnt been in the past but this is a team with a bit of flair something a lot of canadian soccer fans havent seen very much over the last 18 months or so this team has come together as a good group good cohesive unit im really looking forward to see how we can do in this round of qualifying
5482630 i think you can look at that and analyze it and say well the last time it probably took the better part of nine or 10 points to get there
5482631 maybe its going to be the same this time but you dont know theres 18 points on the table youve got to have your team ready to get three in every match were only looking at getting three on wednesday and then go from there
5482632 i think the team has improved a lot in the last year
5482633 theyve got good athletes and theyve got players playing on a good level now i expect a difficult match on wednesday
5482634 theyve got some fast athletes we know that and some of them will be playing for them on wednesday

5482641 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5482642 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5482643 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5482644 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5482645 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5482646 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5482647 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5482648 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship

5482712 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5482713 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5482714 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5482715 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5482716 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5482717 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5482718 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5482719 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5482720 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5482721 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5482722 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5482723 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5482724 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5482725 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children

5482741 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5482742 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5482743 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5482744 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation
5482745 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5482746 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5482747 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5482748 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5482749 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5482750 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this

5482764 this is the olympics on the other side of the world on an odd time zone and when you want information you want it now
5482765 it makes sense that you would go to the internet and find a source that youre familiar with and that you trust and then consume it that way its just symptomatic of how people are consuming media these days
5482766 its been allowed in the past but it hasnt really been that dominant in the past
5482767 the rights holders have owned the rights to the internet in their territories but it was their decision of how much they put out in the past athens was nothing torino there was a little bit this time nbc is streaming 70 per cent of their content

5482777 by doing this time warner forces the class to pay a much larger amount of money than would be the case if they were allowed to purchase a cable box of their choice from the manufacturer of their choosing
5482778 i think its very similar to the cases brought back in those days where slowly but surely the courts whittled away at that kind of protectionist activity by at amp t
5482779 i think the same thing is present here you have a lot of companies out there manufacturing these boxes and theres nothing necessarily proprietary about them

5482792 besides this ridiculously overblown lawsuit we are having one of the most inspiring wonderful and exciting times that weve experienced to date
5482793 as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5482794 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5482795 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5482796 i believe mccain will be a better commander in chief than obama who also opposes gay marriage if we have an experienced seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later
5482797 yes i am a massachusetts republican which is about the same as being an alabama democrat
5482798 it should be known that jonathan crutchleys donation to mccain left the entire board in disbelief
5482799 i am disappointed that we have lost some customers and i understand the anger it is too bad for the website if we lose customers but please never refer to me as a republican i consider it an offense

5482802 very bad sign that the milf chain of command is breaking apart
5482803 how can we proceed with the peace talks if the top officials of the milf cannot control their field commanders we really have to know first from the milf leaders if they are still in control
5482804 even the top leaders of the milf should not let this incident pass this is an insult to their leadership clearly commander bravo is not inclined to respect the milf chain of command and this is a very serious offense in any military organization
5482805 they should not inflame the frustration that some of our military leaders have been feeling right now we are urging the media to handle the moa ad very cautiously so as not to cause more misunderstand that could lead to full scale fighting
5482806 we explained them the importance of peace process we might not have fully convinced them but our leadership prevailed now when the signing of the moa ad did not prosper these leaders are frustrated and this we did not want to happen
5482807 we did not send forces there those might just be people who ride on with the issue
5482808 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5482809 one would have to assume that its going to be this week
5482810 if she wins texas and ohio i think she will be the nominee
5482811 if you dont deliver for her i dont think she can be its all on you
5482812 there is no evidence that voters are voting based on momentum in fact the evidence is to the contrary
5482813 there is not much clinton can do now other than campaign as hard as possible in texas ohio pennsylvania
5482814 at least a paper victory in each of those even if the victories do not translate into much of a delegate pickup will be necessary for her to keep obama in sight
5482815 she needs to be shoring up the support of people who have been supporting her like older voters and women
5482816 its hard to see that there will be a knock out win for either of these candidates
5482817 unless obama has some sweeping victories in key states like texas and ohio
5482818 i honestly dont think there is anything hillary can do at this point to win the nomination
5482819 obama has all the momentum after the string of victories he has amassed and i think he has sealed the deal also i believe it is nearly impossible given proportional allocation of delegates for clinton to surpass obama in the delegate count even if she wins in texas and ohio
5482820 while i actually agree with some critics that obama is more about broad diffuse pronouncements which sometimes turn into platitudes than specific substance it is undisputed that his positive enthusiastic appeals to democrats have taken hold
5482821 while clinton excels in the role of policy wonk obama makes people feel good making people feel good will almost always trump wonkishness in the minds of votes

5482863 defendant physicians contend that exposing them to liability for refusing to perform the iui medical procedure for plaintiff infringes upon their first amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion not so as we noted earlier californias unruh civil rights act imposed on business establishments certain antidiscrimination obligations thus precluding any such establishment or its agents from telling patrons that it will not comply with the act
5482864 these doctors happened to have strongly held religious beliefs about gay people
5482865 theres a great diversity of religious beliefs in california and theyre all protected but not to the point where laws are violated and other people are hurt each of us is protected both in our religious beliefs and also from religiously based discrimination in the doctors office and other commercial settings
5482866 its taken nearly 10 years to get to this point but it was worth it
5482867 its wrong and shocking that some doctors felt their religious beliefs allowed them to ignore the law and discriminate this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women its a win for everyone because anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people

5482896 we just say if you take these assumptions this is what the future may be
5482897 each scientific paper is hoped to be an ever closer approximation to the best possible answer to a question than was the work that had gone before we believe dr wangs paper fulfills that spirit
5482898 i was pretty fortunate to play on some pretty good teams with some pretty good players in my time but thats been a long time ago i havent even been around a football since 1972
5482899 it wasnt always this way but when i got to ohio state in 1960 woody was under a tremendous amount of pressure
5482900 he had won a national championship a couple of years before that but then people got to expecting that every year the year before i got there they had a losing season and that was just unheard of so it was very tough playing for woody in those days because he was really pressing
5482901 but i can also tell you that he wanted every one of his players to do the work that was necessary in the classroom he always said that if you go to ohio state and dont get a degree youve cheated yourself
5482902 now in my family i was the first to go to college i was the first one to graduate from high school but i didnt have good study habits i guess i was like most football players in that i just wanted to do enough to get by so i could play football
5482903 woody wouldnt have that he placed a tremendous emphasis on education and it was tough for me in the early going but that education meant everything to me after football and after me all of my family has gone to college i like to think that i set that standard for them and im proud of that but part of that was because woody challenged me to get that education
5482904 of course in those days there was no bowl if you werent going to the rose bowl
5482905 but i guess beating michigan three times and beating them in your last game is a pretty good way to go out
5482906 the giants had taken another running back joe don looney in the first round
5482907 they also still had frank gifford and alex webster and they wanted me to come in sit behind them and learn for a year or two i didnt want to do that i think you learn by doing and i saw the jets as an opportunity to play right away
5482908 we really had no fear of baltimore in that game
5482909 baltimore played a zone defense in the secondary that we knew we could beat we really thought very early in the week that we were going to win that game
5482910 when tight end pete lammons stood up and told jets head coach weeb ewbank dont show us any more of that were going to get overconfident i guarantee well beat those guys
5482911 a day later joe is out at some function and says the same thing of course he said it in public and thats when it hit the newspapers
5482912 that made three years in a row that i would have had to rehab the entire offseason
5482913 in those days we had to have other jobs in the offseason to supplement our incomes i just figured i was 32 years old and tired of rehabbing i just decided to hang it up
5482914 thats when i bought my daughter there to look at the campus she was getting ready to go to college and she was talking about all the places she was interested in i told her she had to at least go look at ohio state and she did
5482915 it was a really nice visit and i enjoyed it very much im usually not one to look back but that was real nice

5482940 charles murray arguably the most consequential social scientist alive has discovered a nifty formula for fame or infamy one in lucid graceful prose describe reality using evidence and logic two propose policies that actually take reality into consideration and three sit back and wait for the inevitable caterwauling and lamentations of those who insist reality isnt real and who swear the crooked timber of humanity is nothing more than the malleable clay of utopian social engineers real education follows this recipe perfectly even now if you put your ear to the ground you can hear throats being cleared for the caterwauling to come

5483080 sometimes there were very good policy reasons to deny a permit as far as environmental protection but none of it fell within the authority we had
5483081 the important thing to remember is that our authority to overturn the departments decision has to be founded in the rather narrow group of exceptions that are contained in the law

5483110 they organise lines and tell us to come at a particular time but then they have nothing to give us there are men walking away with aid boxes and we get nothing they are also coming to peoples homes and looking for humanitarian aid to take back so that they can start selling it on the streets

5483118 we were careful to match the books to the school workload so lots of the books were pretty short which the boys seemed to appreciate they really ran the discussions themseleves and did an amazingly great job it was nice to see other kids talk about books and also to see your own child in a group like that we could never forget to have lots of cookies chips and plenty of time for basketball or some other physical outlet

5483129 the key to everything is patience you get the chicken by hatching the egg not by smashing it
5483130 the message we need to give people is get out and walk
5483131 jogging is very beneficial its good for your legs and feet its also good for the ground it makes it feel needed
5483132 its because we are a bit scared we wait for others to do it first our friends our neighbors its a cultural thing when we see its fine then we do it
5483133 its like we dont believe its going to happen until it really does happen i cant explain why but we like to wait to until the last minute just in case there is a change
5483134 we are afraid to ask or dont want to spend a few dollars even though its free theyre talking about it everywhere the government is issuing out vouchers

5483152 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5483153 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5483154 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5483155 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5483164 the ritual always starts with the first rays of sun its a homage to the divinity of the sun to show our gratitude for the past year weve eaten were still alive and to wish for a better new year but for this we have to pay with the table
5483165 the ritual tables consist of a paper base on top of which is a preparation of different herbs different symbolic elements houses money elements representing health etc accompanied by cotton wool and a strongly aromatic herb called khoa
5483166 the coca leaf has a fundamental place the ritual table shouldnt be without it
5483167 the people who want to make a wish can do this through the coca leaf you may wish for health or work for example do this through the coca leaves and put them on the table so your wishes and good intentions can become reality in this new year

5483183 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty

5483197 we started this process in december at 26 per share and its management then rejected it that assumption was predicated on the idea that we would be able to sell its games at christmas 2008
5483198 my interpretation is that ea management still wants this business but that the offer is going to be at or below the previous price
5483199 the biggest product take two has to offer has now launched and ea is not going to be able to take advantage of those revenues
5483200 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to its board the significant strides made by take two since it last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5483201 take two passed on the best offer on the planet
5483202 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
5483203 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
5483204 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment

5483206 all my life i had carried a single image of my father one that i had sometimes rebelled against but had never questioned one that i had later tried to take as my own the brilliant scholar the generous friend the upstanding leader my father had been all those things
5483207 all those things and more because except for that one brief visit in hawaii he had never been present to foil the image because i hadnt seen what perhaps most men see at some point in their lives their fathers body shrinking their fathers best hopes dashed their fathers face lined with grief and regret

5483471 dentro de las pol ticas p blicas est el contaminar humedales desde que autoriza la conama con la ley de bases de medioambiente y despu s de todo el proceso terminan construyendo una planta de celulosa justo al lado del santuario carlos anwandter en valdivia con un tubo que evacua hacia ste eso no es s lo no cumplir un tratado eso es contaminar
5483472 extensiones de marismas pantanos turberas o superficies cubiertas de agua sean stas de r gimen natural o artificial permanentes o temporales estancadas o corrientes dulces salobres o saladas incluidas las extensiones de agua marina cuya profundidad de marea baja no exceda de 6 metros
5483473 aqu hay una cultura en que se piensa que el cemento es desarrollo por lo tanto en la medida en que el humedal paicav de concepci n se rellene para los poderes significa desarrollo para la ciudad el humedal es una herida en la ciudad dice el propietario y eso claramente es una estupidez
5483474 hay falta de educaci n puedes llegar a una poblaci n y le preguntas a la gente sabe lo que es un humedal y te responden qu es eso cuando lo puede tener al lado la gente no sabe y la que sabe no est ni ah adem s hay muchos intereses involucrados para que esto quede en ese nivel de ignorancia
5483475 en el norte por ejemplo se da una guerra econ mica por el agua las mineras se han chupado r os enteros como en copiap donde ves un r o que tiene 300 metros de ancho y est seco y en medio hay un canal que cuando lo v dije bueno al menos dejaron el canal para que pasara el poquito de agua que pudo haber quedado y no est seco tambi n
5483476 los planes reguladores de la regi n siguen sin hablar de humedales por ejemplo si tenemos 30 humedales urbanos que fueron los que se catastraron por la misma conama el a o pasado en el plano regulador solo hay 3 reconocidos como zonas de valor natural y eso te da a entender que concepci n no est planificado para lo que realmente es un gran humedal urbano
5483477 creemos que el seia sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental no es el instrumento id neo para resolver el tema de los humedales urbanos pensamos que hay que fijar la atenci n en los planes reguladores comunales y metropolitanos toda vez que all se dan las reglas del juego respecto de lo que se puede y no se puede hacer en un territorio dado y esto debe conversarse entre todos los actores
5483478 el estudio de impacto ambiental lo revisa un organismo t cnico que son muy pocos funcionarios que es la conama y despu s hay otro organismo que aprueba o rechaza que es la corema en nuestra regi n no rechazan nada lo aprueban todo he visto esto en varios consejos de evaluaci n por ejemplo en el plano regulador de coihueco viene un funcionario de conama y presenta 10 diapositivas y los consejeros levantan la mano y lo aprueban y eso que ni conocen coihueco no vieron los planos en detalle s lo presentaciones en power point no leyeron los informes previos ese es el nivel de superficialidad que existe y que hace tambi n que aprueben todo

5483484 americans are ready to rally behind the idea that government can be a part of the solution to our economic woes as we argue in this special issue these times demand a popular movement on behalf of a vision as bold as the great society whose democratic supporters won not just the white house but sufficiently robust congressional majorities to turn the ship of state off the crash course charted by previous george bushes and john mccains

5483489 signora come pensavo non c nessun altro posto libero in classe economica ho parlato col comandante e mi ha confermato che non c nessun posto neanche in classe executive ci rimasto libero soltanto un posto in prima classe
5483490 vede e insolito per la nostra compagnia permettere a una persona con biglietto di classe economica di sedersi in prima classe ma viste le circostanze il comandante pensa che sarebbe scandaloso obbligare qualcuno a sedersi a fianco di una persona sgradevole
5483491 quindi signore se lo desidera prenda il suo bagaglio a mano che un posto in prima classe la attende

5483552 ha quedado configurado un golpe electoral que compromete a los partidos pol ticos y al gobierno
5483553 el gobierno y el apra han visto alterada su estrategia al no pasar a la segunda vuelta
5483554 el fredemo sufri una derrota significativa al no haber obtenido un mandato claro

5483557 no se percibe en el alto mando preocupaci n por la participaci n de las ffaa en la conducci n pol tica del pa s que es inevitable

5483559 cambio 90 no es m s que una corriente de opini n no fue capaz siquiera de inscribir candidatos en diez departamentos
5483560 la renuncia de cualquiera de los dos candidatos configurar a un problema de orden legal constitucional

5483564 nos encontramos en el escenario n 3 periodos n 2 y 3 de la apreciaci n de inteligencia estrat gica del 20 de febrero de 1990 el resultado oficial de la segunda vuelta era la diferencia entre el periodo n 2 y 3 dado el desplome de nuestra principal dificultad fredemo dicha diferencia desaparece
5483565 el golpe electoral del 8 de abril ha quedado consolidado con el resultado del 10 de junio
5483566 los partidos pol ticos han sido rechazados en su totalidad
5483567 la derrota de vargas llosa y su alejamiento del pa s han configurado un vac o de liderazgo en importantes sectores econ micos y sociales

5483569 algunos comandos de las ffaa desde hace tres semanas son motivo de especial control por parte de palacio
5483570 dado que no podemos esperar nada seguro de cambio 90 y la patria no est para mas experimentos econ micos y dado que nos encontramos listos ning n escenario debe ser descartado el escenario n 3 sigue vigente de an lisis hay que reconocer que el esperar al 10 de junio fue un xito dado el resultado electoral
5483571 los grupos subversivos fuertemente golpeados y debilitados en los ltimos meses podr an recibir un golpe demoledor con una poderosa represi n de los primeros 90 d as de la junta de gobierno efecto que podr a tener un alto valor estrat gico impulsando la pol tica de pacificaci n
5483572 el circuito es impresionante y el lugar es fant stico por lo que estoy esperando que llegue el gran premio el equipo ha trabajado duro para preparar esta carrera porque es un circuito nuevo para todos nosotros pero desde el punto de vista de un piloto lo m s importante es la primera vez que corres en l y a continuaci n comienzas a comprender mejor el circuito
5483573 me gusta ir a circuitos nuevos porque son un nuevo reto y siempre hay algo que descubrir cada carrera es nica y esto me gusta aunque se trata de una pista nueva para nosotros conozco muy bien valencia de todas las pruebas que hemos hecho en el otro circuito es una ciudad animada y siempre parece que pasa algo por lo que debe ser un fin de semana divertido
5483574 espero un fin de semana muy competitivo porque en este momento somos muy fuertes nuestro objetivo es anotar m s puntos y si conseguimos subir al podio de nuevo ser a estupendo
5483575 todav a estoy sonriendo despu s de hungr a se trata de un resultado incre ble y una sensaci n fant stica espero que sea el primero de muchos podios en la f rmula 1 lo m s importante es que nos mostr lo competitivos que somos y adelantamos hasta el cuarto lugar en el campeonato de constructores
5483576 hay una gran atm sfera en el equipo y todos estamos trabajando juntos para avanzar raz n por la cual conseguimos el podio en hungr a pero valencia es una nueva carrera y tenemos que empezar de nuevo hice un mont n de carreras en circuitos urbanos cuando estaba en las carreras de champ cars y durante esa temporada casi todas las pistas eran nuevas para m por lo que aprend a adaptarme r pidamente
5483577 parece un interesante circuito y es bastante largo por lo que deber a darse un buen espect culo tendremos mucho trabajo que hacer el viernes para ajustar el coche a la pista pero estamos en buena forma en este momento por lo que me siento optimista para este fin de semana
5483578 estamos bien preparados para valencia por supuesto hemos empezado nuestros preparativos para esta nueva pista con los datos y la informaci n de la fia que nos ha permitido simular unos perfiles de velocidad a fin de estimar el downforce y los requisitos de frenado por ejemplo
5483579 tambi n enviamos personal para ver la carrera inaugural a finales de julio y esto nos ha proporcionado datos adicionales con respecto a los perfiles de velocidad y trazadas a seguir en la pista esperamos que la pista necesite la gama media de downforce y frenadas muy fuertes

5483582 musharrafs brazen disrespect for human rights and the rule of law for nearly a decade finally caught up with him
5483583 by undoing musharrafs unlawful acts and holding him to account for his crimes the pakistani government would advance human rights and national security in the country
5483584 but as they enjoy the games from the comfort of their seats at the olympic stadium they should reflect on their failure to speak up for the chinese citizens who built the stadium and their hotels clean their hotel rooms serve their meals or in the case of chinese journalists try to bring them their news
5483585 that is the role of human rights organizations in this respect we are from mars youre from venus
5483586 ge seeks to advance human rights by leading by example through our interactions with customers and suppliers the products we offer and our relationships with communities and governments
5483587 i believe the olympics are a force for good and if they were not a force for good we would not sponsor them
5483588 being a good corporate sponsor of the beijing games has sadly not meant being a good corporate citizen
5483589 the sponsors silence has only emboldened the chinese government and allowed the ioc to ignore the human rights standards it claims to uphold
5483590 do we want to be associated with a firestorm no we do not
5483591 in the context of the olympics tibet is not relevant none of the olympics takes place in tibet the games are not in tibet
5483592 it would not make sense for us to raise the issue of tibet with our chinese interlocutors the chinese think that corporate sponsors do not have a dog in this fight
5483593 what we recognize is that as a legal entity we dont have the same position as people our sole purpose as a company is to make money for shareholders to make money we need to protect the brand its a complex set of equations what our prime purpose is not is to advocate human rights
5483594 our commitment to human rights is in our area of how we treat employees our human rights policy does not address the policies of foreign governments it is not our comfort zone to criticize countries
5483595 we are not in business to be global spokespersons for causes that is the role of human rights organizations in this respect we are from mars youre from venus
5483596 it would be inappropriate for us to take up human rights issues around the olympics the question is about appropriate roles and responsibilities
5483597 this is the sundial which is a fiery like dial to cast out on a star
5483598 these are supposed to be benches because we wanted to tie it in with an outdoor classroom so teachers could teach and students could be outside

5483654 there is so much information out there according to the county wind turbines have to be at least 1 000 feet from someones home we didnt feel that cushion was long enough
5483655 we did some research and a wind farm manufacturer thought that no one should be working within 1 300 feet of a wind tower
5483656 one of the main components is the 1 000 feet set back from a home was moved back to a half mile

5483659 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees

5483707 women start adult life happier than men but end up less happy
5483708 women are more likely than men to be in unions and this makes for greater fulfillment of both family life and material
5483709 i was encouraged by a group of people to run in the last couple of weeks so we filed our papers and launched a campaign
5483710 in just a couple of weeks time weve recruited over a hundred volunteers
5483711 i think ive been able to be responsive to individuals and to the communities i represent and to the issues of concern to them
5483712 i expect to campaign as i have in the past reaching out to all the voters in the district whether through door to door canvassing coffees different community events
5483713 she is an experienced community servant shes done a lot of community work particularly with young people and working with at risk kids
5483714 so i think she brings an understanding of how to better a community she also brings an interesting batch of life experiences
5483715 hes a great advocate for all the communities that he represents
5483716 i think my skills working collaboratively with diverse sectors of the community will bring people together to address many pressing needs from how to heat our homes in the winter to how to meet our rising costs in health care and special education
5483717 businesses should be paying their fair share and i think he should have voted to close the corporate tax loopholes which allow them not to pay their fair share
5483718 as the economy is struggling and heading into if not in a recession this is not the right time to go raise taxes on businesses
5483719 there is a very real question of whether it would ever happen
5483720 im not familiar with my opponent ever having done anything in the community of reading in terms of civic involvement
5483721 no mom studies show games are actually beneficial see it says so right here
5483722 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now

5483725 its generally accepted that london is the divorce capital of the world
5483726 it also helps that prenuptial agreements are not binding in this country although the court can take them into account
5483727 oligarchs are now worried that their wives may start divorce proceedings over here
5483728 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands in tax breaks for people earning 2 5 million because theyre only middle class
5483729 everyone making 2 5 million or more raise your hands
5483730 i think if youre just talking about income how about five million
5483731 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5483732 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5483733 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5483734 this guy obviously does not pump his own gas he obviously does not do his own shopping he obviously does not pay his own bills

5483744 daar zijn de hollandse blonde en blanke meisjes onze belangrijkste lezers
5483745 veel media denken dat ze hun vaste publiek ermee wegjagen en geen nieuw publiek aanboren
5483746 de verhouding van allochtonen en blanke nederlanders is in heel nederland ook geen
5483747 op de ene plek is een stal voor vijfduizend beesten veel te groot op een andere plaats kunnen er wel drie het gaat om ruimtelijke kwaliteit en wat past in het buitengebied
5483748 willen ze in groningen dat de landbouw een exportfactor van betekenis blijft of niet
5483749 ik ben z gelukkig dit is minstens twee keer zo goed als de verkiezingen winnen nu zijn alle obstakels weg om problemen op te ruimen
5483750 als allah het wil worden alle problemen nu snel opgelost
5483751 musharraf voerde het beleid van president bush uit hij vermoordde moslims terwijl we een moslimland zijn we zijn heel blij dat hij weg is
5483752 we gaan hem berechten we gaan hem geen veilige aftocht geven
5483753 op enig moment zal de wal het schip gaan keren
5483754 gemeentes moeten nu echt kritisch gaan kijken naar de bouw van nieuwe winkelcentra ze lijken zich vaak te laten meeslepen door projectontwikkelaars daardoor komen bestaande winkels op mindere locaties zeker in economisch zwaar weer onder druk te staan
5483755 het gaat nu nog goed met de detailhandel in nederland ik deel de vrees van de rnd als er geen rem wordt gezet op de ontwikkeling van nieuwe winkelcentra in hengelo staat retailpark plein westermaat op stapel het retailpark in roermond is volop in ontwikkeling tilburg krijgt zijn shopping mall steden gaan de concurrentie met elkaar aan maar zouden zich ook moeten afvragen in hoeverre al die vierkante meters winkelruimte in te passen zijn in het bestaande aanbod
5483756 het is belangrijk dat gemeentes niet alleen naar de kansen kijken als je voortdurend nieuwe winkelcentra wilt bouwen moet je ook oog hebben voor de bedreigingen en de problematiek op andere locaties hoe willen we omgaan met winkelcentra die verloederen en de concurrentie met groot en nieuw niet aankunnen
5483757 de meeste centra zijn bij voorbaat grotendeels verhuurd van buitenlandse ketens was en is veel interesse voor vestiging in nederland denk daarbij aan h amp m hornbach of starbucks dat er nu aankomt zon keten neemt geen genoegen met drie winkeltjes die willen overal gaan zitten
5483758 zie het maar als een denkoefening een stap in een voortgaand proces
5483759 de navo moet de gulden middenweg vinden in het herpositioneren van de relatie met rusland
5483760 rusland eist een plaats op die in overeenstemming is met zijn rang als grootmacht
5483761 ik ben zeer bezorgd dat oekra ne het volgende doelwit zal worden
5483762 waarschijnlijk zijn meer landen de afgelopen tijd sceptisch geworden over die stap
5483763 dat is voor een alleenstaande jonge vrouw meer dan genoeg ik woon centraal heb nauwelijks hoeven te klussen en betaal lagere maandlasten dan wanneer ik een vergelijkbaar appartement zou huren als ik een volledig huis zou kopen zou ik me bovendien heel wat administratief werk op de nek halen
5483764 starters hebben een inkomen en een bescheiden kapitaal bovendien hechten ze vaak waarde aan nette afwerking van het pand en aan degelijke voorzieningen studenten zijn minder veeleisend die leunen financieel meestal op hun ouders en vinden het al lang prima dat ze aan rommelige studentenhuizen kunnen ontsnappen
5483765 de startersmarkt schreeuwt om oplossingen in de randstad maar ook in nijmegen en groningen starters willen weg uit hun studentenkamer maar kunnen vanwege de hoge prijzen voor eengezinswoningen vaak nergens terecht
5483766 veel gemeentes kampen met huizen die vanwege een te hoge vraagprijs eindeloos te koop staan doordat wij onze panden opdelen helpen we de doorstroming weer op gang
5483767 de randstad mag dan op slot zitten in nijmegen is een huis vinden nog geen onmogelijke opgave
5483768 maar ik wilde centraal wonen in een karakteristiek pand een groezelige buitenwijk leek me niets daar heb ik niet eens naar ge nformeerd
5483769 een groot voordeel van een studio is dat een speciale administrateur de rekeningen betaalt en de administratie bijhoudt dat loopt nu nog niet altijd even soepel maar is wel een verlichting
5483770 die gezamenlijke zeggenschap wil nog wel eens onenigheid opleveren sommigen zijn nog student en besparen liever een schoonmaakster vinden ze overbodige luxe
5483771 mij niet deze keuze levert ook gezelschap op ons huis heeft niet de allure van een studentenhuis maar sociaal contact is er zeker dat is in een flat wel anders
5483772 als buurvrouw heb je minder macht dan als collega bewoner de juridische samenwerking schept ook een sociale verplichting
5483773 dan is mijn studio daar niet geschikt voor op zon moment zou ik hem met gerust hart verkopen mijn maandlasten zijn dan telkens lager geweest dan wanneer ik gehuurd had en dan reken ik de overwaarde nog niet eens mee ik zie het als een mooie investering
5483774 toen we begonnen was het gewoon een klein ijswinkeltje in een oude benzinepomp het was geen politiek statement niet meer dan iets dat ons leuk leek om een paar jaar te doen en dan zagen we wel weer verder we hadden nooit gedacht dat het zo groot zou worden sterker nog dat was helemaal niet onze bedoeling
5483775 naar gelang we groter groeiden begonnen we te zien hoe groot de invloed van bedrijven binnen de samenleving is
5483776 het viel ons op dat bedrijven slechts uit waren op n ding het maximaliseren van hun eigen winst ons ideaal was om een soort buurman te zijn die niet alleen op winst uit was maar zich ook inzette voor de gemeenschap
5483777 ik denk zeker dat we de verantwoordelijkheid hebben om ons er zorgen over te maken zegt jerry
5483778 maar bij ben amp jerrys maken we niet alleen calorierijk ijs maar ook lowfat frozen yoghurt en vetvrije sorbets zodat we een alternatief kunnen bieden ook moedigen we mensen via een serving size op de verpakking aan om niet een hele bak ijs in een keer op te eten
5483779 als het gesmolten is is het verpest maar laat het nu net zo zijn dat de vriezers die het ijs van de fabrikant koud houden ook verantwoordelijk zijn voor het grootste aandeel 46 procent van de ecologische hoefafdruk van de ijsketen en dus de grootste bedreiging vormen voor het klimaat
5483780 ik zie steeds meer initiatieven op het gebied van duurzame veehouderij
5483781 maar ik ken geen enkel bedrijf dat hierin zo ver gaat als het caring dairy project
5483782 wij doen dit omdat wij geloven dat dit de juiste manier is maar het is ook zeker goed voor zaken
5483783 in het bedrijfsleven heerst het gevoel dat als je een sociaal en duurzaam bedrijf wilt zijn dit afdoet aan je vermogen om winst te maken ze denken dat het een kostenpost is maar onze ervaring is juist het tegenovergestelde
5483784 soms doet het bedrijf het heel goed op andere momenten hobbelt het maar een beetje mee net als iedere andere
5483785 we waren een publiek bedrijf en iedereen kon aandelen van ons kopen unilever bood zoveel geld dat de leiders van het bedrijf het gevoel hadden dat het hun verantwoordelijkheid tegenover de aandeelhouders was om dat geld binnen te halen
5483786 bepaalde onderdelen zoals de financi n en de productie zijn helemaal in unilever ge ntegreerd maar voor andere elementen waaronder de productontwikkeling marketing en onze sociale missies hebben we autonomie gekregen daar hebben we onze eigen mensen die strijden voor de dingen waar ze in geloven soms zijn ze succesvol andere keren niet uiteindelijk besluit unilever maar tot dusver hebben ze ons aardig vrij gelaten
5483787 sinds ben amp jerrys bij unilever hoort is het bedrijf op zijn eigen uitgesproken manier goed blijven functioneren
5483788 last year we learned how to set the camera up and in 6th grade we were kind of introduced to the whole studio
5483789 its definitely challenging but once you learn how to use it its not that complicated
5483790 were starting to do activities in the classroom that use powerpoint so it helps me out a lot
5483791 we need our kids to work on their language arts skills and their writing skills so their reading comprehension will increase
5483792 i hope to apply it toward being a technician to help hook up stuff because at first i didnt know how to hook up a basic camera and i didnt know how to use a basic powerpoint but i learned how to do that when we got out here
5483793 making decaf coffee from chemicals is honestly just messing with the natural order of things

5484128 jeanne found me here well over a year ago and we have been in contact ever since it has been easy to stay in contact with her and her family because we have similar personalities i have been fortunate to see her family grow and have been to her children s birthday parties this type of relationship has also been built with others not only has the social networking helped clients find me but has also built great relationships across the u s in the real estate industry or the re net the small core group of real estate agents across the united states have been networking for years building businesses and friendships along the way we help each other with websites marketing ideas and new business ventures within this network we are able to share real estate referrals that we know when we hand off a client to someone across the us that they are in good hands they are not blindly passed on to some stranger that has access to the mls making connections

5484137 emotions are an important part of christian life but not the most important
5484138 what we feel is not the final test of what is the truth
5484139 the fact this poll has been taken over the past eight weeks i think inevitably reflects some of that destabilisation thats been going on
5484140 no one is getting too excited about these polls particularly given that we are two and a half years from election day
5484141 its just before an election maybe elections force action much needed action on climate change
5484142 its a very important piece of legislation because this government came to office saying it would be open and accountable and talked about freedom of information reform

5484160 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5484161 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5484162 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble

5484164 every single property has been acquired on a voluntary basis which by definition means that people have made an assessment of their own financial circumstances
5484165 its reasonable to assume that they would not have volunteered to have their property acquired unless overall they were in a much better financial position at the end of it
5484166 this is arguably one of the most generous compensation packages in the states history

5484173 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5484174 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5484175 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5484197 youre probably wondering why i decided not to attend your church
5484198 there was a couple at your church that we had gone to church with for years i dont know if they were members or if they were just visiting but my husband and i decided right then and there that we certainly could not go to church with them
5484199 i know thats not a very good reason for choosing a church but these people were so needy

5484215 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5484216 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5484217 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5484218 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5484219 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5484220 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5484221 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5484222 the hope is so high that it will have some effect that everybodys asking for it
5484223 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5484224 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5484225 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5484226 i think your experiment has been a success youve shown that this doesnt work for you and youve done it in only two weeks thats half the time it ususally takes for you to decide something doesnt work right so all youve really done is save time great job im impressed
5484227 i cant pick who wore it best both girls are equally cute suri with her dark hair and that adorable face and violet with those to die for dimples both celebrity tots are pretty special
5484228 maybe try kickboxing they have a class the night im in school
5484229 you better start punching some bricks to toughen up then

5484232 maybe the problem isnt the panties maybe you just need to be more comfortable with showing them you know like tennis players
5484233 but with tennis you rather expect to see undies i dont think people come to the y looking for flash dance
5484234 i think the reality is that standards are set for how people look by people by the media by tv shows and magazines and not everyone is blessed with the right looks and for something thats easy to change well it avoids a lot of difficulty at school my greatest role as a plastic surgeon is to level the playing field to give those children who are disadvantaged a chance to look better
5484235 youre metabolism will fall and youll gain weight and wrinkles will sprout overnight
5484236 your skin glows like a thousand splendid suns but not the book because while that book was awesome it was kind of gritty and so totally not like your skin

5484561 henry poole is here is one of those movies you can kind of get caught up in la in all these dark blockbusters like dark knight but in the real america these small character driven movies can certainly say something to folks who arent the type who embrace something on hype or faith at the drop of a hat

5484583 going forward we are challenged to validate that 25 74 price

5484622 but otherwise he seems healthy and happy and hes wonderful
5484623 were really overflowing with animals and we have many more coming in than are going out
5484624 i think having chunk here has raised a lot of awareness
5484625 at any given time today id say weve had at least 50 people in the building
5484626 we went to buy a motor home for amp pound16 000 but ended up paying amp pound37 000 for one because it had a section at the back that was ideal for sugar
5484627 i love sugar to bits and didnt want to leave her behind
5484628 i want to express my gratitude to the dozens of bridgeport residents who worked tirelessly to help reunite me with my cat
5484629 in the 12 days since i have been looking for parsley i have encountered so many wonderful people in this city and i have immense gratitude to them
5484630 i had quite an experience i saw the good of the city and i have seen some things i hope nobody ever experiences
5484631 i was very concerned about the neighborhood at night so i arranged to be there with him
5484632 was very upset because the cat was like a member of his family
5484633 i showed him my fluffy and he became very emotional but i told him to wait a few minutes and the female cat would show him the way and she did
5484634 i dont know who owns her or where she came from but she came out of a wooded area and pointed me to where parsley was
5484635 as i approached the area she was pointing as parsley came out and he walked right into my arms he was purring and happy to see me
5484636 i call her six toes because she had six toes on her feet nobody owns her and i have been feeding her every day
5484637 he slept all day wednesday apparently exhausted from his ordeal but i could tell he was very happy to be home
5484638 we are both very happy he is home where he belongs
5484639 firefighter scott mcphee volunteered to climb the ladder and rescue the cat
5484640 he grabbed it by the neck and carried it down but before he got to the bottom the cat jumped down and ran away
5484641 when i arrived it was sitting perched on top of the pole doing a balancing act
5484642 but it seemed quite happy it was just looking around and surveying its kingdom
5484643 there was no way we could get it down so we called the fire service the cat was uninjured we assume it headed straight home
5484644 then there was a loud crash and i woke up
5484645 i ran to my sons room shook him awake and called the fire brigade
5484646 i am only alive because of my cat i am so grateful to her
5484647 its not actually that unusual for pets to notice smoke first and alert their owners
5484648 we managed to weigh it down and slide it right down into the pipe work
5484649 with a lot of coaxing and everything we managed to entice her with food and her toys to climb up the netting and we eventually managed to get her out of the pipe work
5484650 we were lucky the forecasted rain hadnt really come so there wasnt water pouring down the hillside and down the pipe work
5484651 we dont know what wouldve happened to her then because i think at the other end of the pipe theres about a 40ft drop as it comes out into the river
5484652 just be aware this is potentially toxic to cats as well as dogs
5484653 i saw him laying in the middle of the road
5484654 i saw cars going right over top of his body running him completely over and just never paying any attention i saw his head move and just slammed on my brakes
5484655 he had a severed tongue broken jaw split soft palate cracked eye socket ripped eyelids and missing teeth
5484656 another quarter of an inch and he would have had brain damage
5484657 weve had at least 20 people come by in person to make a donation after the article
5484658 these werent even clients of mine just animal lovers we had two out of state financial donations we are also pitching in of course so his bills are basically paid
5484659 to be honest it killed me to give him up
5484660 i think i knew she was the right person when dr taylors office called and told me that lisa had come by to inquire about finley because the story had touched her so deeply but she didnt want to see him because she didnt want to upset or disturb him
5484661 i read the paper and said i have to have that cat
5484662 i tossed and turned all that night thinking about him and didnt get any sleep i woke up in the morning and called the hospital first thing about adopting him then i stopped by about two hours after that to ask again
5484663 i knew it was tracys decision i was just so hoping that i would get to have him
5484664 she told me that shed taken stray cats in for medical treatment in the past and i was positive that the poor little guy would have a forever home
5484665 my daughter had just taken one of our cats to her fiancees house so there was room at the inn
5484666 hes blind due to the accident and has some problems with missing the litter box
5484667 so i gate him up while im at work somehow he jumps the gate i dont know how i call him my little houdini
5484668 his mouth alignment is perfect his teeth fit together perfectly his tongue has healed well everything is going good
5484669 well youre going to have to eventually slow down on that
5484670 he will sit in my lap for hours he is the perfect loving cat i think because he cant see we are his security blanket

5484676 well i dont know we got married he said he wanted to marry me we were going to have kids he told me i was the love of his life he did all kinds of things and when he took me to meet his parents well hed not taken a woman home to meet them in 15 years you know since high school hed not brought a woman home i was her as far as i knew or could tell thats sure as hell what he told me
5484677 so i married him and he was never happy with me not a day not one day was he happy
5484678 well he just didnt like me as far as i could tell it was pretty baffling baffled everyone i think he was baffled himself for the most part why dont i like her its strange thing he didnt like me and besides that he just wasnt cut out to be married thats for sure
5484679 hell no he wanted to be a guru on a mountain i guess he was all elevated he was a high mind im telling you people thought he was a big deal they damned near worshiped him and he worshiped me at least for awhile he thought i was the bees knees thats what he said thats what he told everyone but actually when you get right down to it i dont think he even liked me never mind loved me he married my hologram there is no doubt about it and he was very unhappily married but not for long i got him out of it pretty damned quick he should be grateful
5484680 yeah i didnt hang around for long i told you he broke my wedding ring on the second night yep 2 days after we were married my ring was smashed and boy was he sorry about that he made a big deal of it he had that thing repaired oh it was a scene hes all sorry and stuff and right after that valentines day came and he didnt get me anything not a thing and it was particularly gruesome because i showered him with gifts it was really something i mean he didnt even get me a card and i had all these presents for him i has all these presents for him they were spilling off the table and he didnt get me anything at all
5484681 it was embarrassing embarrassing for both of us id say it was something to see ill tell you that he just had all this stuff to open man i had really fixed him up
5484682 yeah and he said he was unhappy and i said what do you want to do i mean we had been married just a few weeks want to get divorced i asked him if he wanted to divorce and i guess he took a look at our wedding pictures and said no he said we looked like two happy people and we should try to give it a go but then he went back in the other direction the next night and it was just bad there is little you can do if someone doesnt like you he was complaining about my toenails for chrissakes they scraped his leg when we were sleeping one night and he had to sleep in a different bed because of it
5484683 and then one night he said he was going to get me a bumper sticker
5484684 its a great feeling though a bit of an anti climax with the way it ended
5484685 there was a lot of pressure because my family are over and i wanted to give them an excuse to go out for a bevvy or two
5484686 every time i hit him i knew id sickened him this lithuanian has been a thorn in my side ever since he beat me in germany when i was 20 so this win means a lot to me
5484687 breaking my hand in chicago and being unable to fight cammarelle was one of the low points of my career i knew id meet him somewhere down the line at the olympics and now its going to happen
5484688 ive beaten one of the favourites here and hopefully i can beat another
5484689 thankfully weve got one medal in the bank now and hopefully two more will follow

5484694 deixou o estudar o que queria entrar e sair da casa quando queria e viver sem pagar aluguer durante anos quando para todos os efeitos kafka ganhava bem
5484695 preciso deixar de olhar para o mito e olhar para o que kafka realmente escreveu
5484696 they thought i was joking eventually i had to show them my new bank cards to get them to believe me they kept asking why people seemed vaguely disapproving as if we were breaking a sacred rule

5484701 everything that made the banana splits popular in the 60s is back including the groups terrific humour and music
5484702 we take great pride in having carefully updated the look and feel of the original show for todays kids while retaining all of the elements that made the original banana splits such a hit
5484703 the banana splits is a classic that has been entertaining kids for years
5484704 were thrilled to have this new version on cartoon network for our kids to enjoy today
5484705 i havent got a clue to be honest with you i havent played many games recently so i honestly cant say
5484706 there is a big squad there and everyone is fighting for their place and i just have to train well and take the chance if i get it
5484707 i havent played but i will just wait and see and when the transfer window closes we will know then
5484708 i will wait and see if i can get into the team if not then obviously i want to play so we will just have to take it from there
5484709 we have spoken about it but at this time i dont think i will say too much more
5484710 when i was first talking with xabi about a transfer we needed money after these months it is not a question of money we would have to have a massive offer because alonso is a great player
5484711 but if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player
5484712 dont forget we will need eight british players and the left footer we were talking about can play in three positions too
5484713 it will be a difficult match but i think well play much better than them
5484714 we will not make any mistake against them or we may pay for that
5484715 we lost 0 3 in the copa america final now there are some different players in the argentine team but we still have four or five players who played that match in the team now
5484716 it was a good finish from fernando i was just behind the shot and i could see exactly where it was going it was a great strike and it gave the keeper no chance
5484717 the most important thing is that we got the win we have had pre season and that was our first game in the league so it was good to get three points on the board and keep a clean sheet
5484718 we have to be happy with that but we have to look at what we can do better because there are many many things that we can do better
5484719 the next game is at home against middlesbrough on saturday so hopefully we will do a lot better then
5484720 it was tough for us at the start of the game they came out of the blocks really quickly and set a really high tempo which youd expect because it was their first home game of the season
5484721 they put us under a lot of pressure and maybe we were a little bit slow to get going
5484722 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5484723 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5484724 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5484725 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5484726 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5484727 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5484728 it has been good for the three players to be involved in the olympics and we are proud of them
5484729 but it is also good for liverpool that argentina and brazil clash in the last four because only one of our lads will be in the final
5484730 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5484731 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5484732 they were always like oh my god you ate a muffin and what do you mean you weigh 125 you cant shoot at that weight
5484733 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5484734 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5484735 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5484736 mary please call me why wont you return my calls this is the fourth message ive left please call we need to talk

5484741 politically it was just off base with the whole feeling over here at manhunt
5484742 he said if john is too good for my money ill give it to presumptive democratic nominee barack obama
5484743 if we have an experienced seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later
5484744 yes virginia there is such a thing as post racial politics
5484745 attention iowa democrats please organize a search party for dlc chairman harold ford thank you
5484746 im hillary clinton and i did not approve this message
5484747 paging john edwards and barack obama your republican talking points are calling
5484748 ted kennedy endorsed obama to preserve jfks civil rights legacy what legacy
5484749 has a kind of deliberate ugliness that has been exploited as a gimmick
5484750 the russian general vyacheslav borisov promised last night to start the pullout at 10 a m but so far there is no sign
5484751 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5484752 a civil servant is supposed to work for the people and not use his position for his own benefit
5484753 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted

5484758 logistics theyll fuck you up every time you gotta take care of them logistics or else you got nothing
5484759 the thing ive personally always enjoyed the most about it however is innovating
5484760 her book bag had been dragged through the mud her schoolmates had created an
5484761 olivias story broke our hearts especially when we learned that she was suicidal we couldnt imagine such cruelty
5484762 suddenly we were thrust into the world of bullying as we read the letters sent to olivia by former bullies and targets of these bullies we learned of the remorse adults felt having been bullies themselves in their teen years and of the depression the targets of bullies still experience years after they have been bullied
5484763 letters to a bullied girl messages of healing and hope
5484764 i tend to be attracted to black and latin chicks and asian chicks
5484765 using government aid to preach a religionist belief system called feminism
5484766 spreading prejudice and fostering animosity and distrust toward men with the result of the wholesale violation of mens rights due to ignorance falsehoods and malice
5484767 demonizes men and exalts women in order to justify discrimination against men based on collective guilt
5484768 if team gb remains ahead of australia come the end of the olympics there will be renewed enthusiasm for an australian republic and they will take the queens head off the stamps
5484769 watching their celebrations watching how great it makes them feel that transfers on to us as well and we feel part of it
5484770 when we listen to the commentaries its the gb team and how well we are doing and that use of language draws us into it and makes us feel part of it
5484771 i suspect it will be a temporary thing its not going to substantially affect a nationalist movement in scotland or wales
5484772 this might be a good time to push out our chest and lift our head above the barriers
5484773 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5484774 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5484775 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5484776 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5484777 my name is piers im an arsenal season ticket holder and im officially depressed what the hell is happening to my club
5484778 i watched us struggling to beat the staggeringly ordinary fc twente on wednesday night and felt so frustrated i nearly switched over to big brother
5484779 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5484780 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5484781 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5484782 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5484783 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5484784 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5484785 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5484786 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5484787 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5484788 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5484789 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5484790 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5484791 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5484792 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5484793 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5484794 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5484795 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5484796 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5484797 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5484798 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5484799 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5484800 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5484801 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5484802 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5484803 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5484804 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5484805 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5484806 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5484807 ve meg det er ute med meg for eg er ein mann med ureine lipper og eg bur mellom eit folk med ureine lipper

5484809 why is someone ringing me in the middle of the night
5484810 when i decided to start my store my husband insisted that i couldnt have plain white walls
5484811 because you rejected me and she looked so much like you
5484812 because of the lords great love we are not consumed for his compassions never fail they are new every morning great is your faithfulness
5484813 i love to play for the chicago bulls because im the kind of guy that when i play somewhere for more than two years it becomes my team to me emotionally
5484814 but with the national team you are representing your home country so i feel it in my heart i feel it in my chest i feel it in my national colors
5484815 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0
5484816 will give developers a chance to build polished applications once hardware is available
5484817 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5484818 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0
5484819 we know that these changes will affect many developers who have worked with the prior early looks at the sdk and we are very sorry for the resulting inconvenience
5484820 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform
5484821 could it be because looks do matter on one hand we have a young man who wins 7 gold medals then there comes in another dude and hes an instant heartthrob geez i wonder why maybe you could explain it for me if you cant then maybe amanda could yeah ask her in the next podcast thanks and while youre at it name one heartthrob ever that wasnt classicly good looking and achieved that title based on personality alone
5484822 looks arent necessary to get laid even in the face of competition from supermodel type males even when were talking about hb10s
5484823 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5484824 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5484825 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5484826 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5484827 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5484828 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5484829 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5484835 she walked into the pediatric e r complaining of abdominal pain they found out that shes at least six months pregnant she claimed not to know she said she was having monthly periods her water broke in the e r and shes fully dilated

5484838 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5484839 its based on this movie with helen hunt and kevin spacey in it called pay it forward with all of the things happening to me these days i thought it was exactly what i needed something entirely positive
5484840 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5484841 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5484842 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5484843 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5484844 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5484845 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5484846 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5484847 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5484848 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5484849 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5484850 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5484853 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5484854 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5484855 in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness
5484856 through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins
5484857 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
5484858 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners
5484859 he hath appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself christ was once offered to bear the sins of many
5484860 by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified
5484861 the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
5484862 this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins
5484863 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
5484864 if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake
5484865 the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
5484866 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed
5484867 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5484868 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5484869 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5484870 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5484871 signs of not getting enough sleep or sleeping poorly include consistently taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep awakening more than a few times or for long periods each night feeling sleepy during the day or having trouble concentrating at school or at work

5485077 communities that act quickly and decisively once a storm has passed can avoid many of the pitfalls associated with contracting for repairs and securing damage recovery from the insurers of their buildings or facilities

5485088 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5485089 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5485090 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble
5485091 these people guest workers certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5485092 maar ze bezitten slechts twee ogen en er zitten maar 24 uur in een dag vijftig of zestig jaar geleden bestonden de media voor de meeste mensen uit de plaatselijke bioscoop radio en de lokale krant nu hebben mensen een veelvoud aan manieren om sneller zij het niet noodzakelijkerwijs beter ge nformeerd te worden en hebben ze ook meer entertainment opties maar niemand heeft een manier bedacht om de tijd die mensen aan het volgen van entertainment besteden verder te laten toenemen

5485096 we were attracted by a number of factors the success of the series to date especially taking into account that this was being distributed by an independent publisher at the time the legions of online super fans around the world and their receptivity to the positive messages being communicated in the books and online this is a powerful integrated brand poised to become a major contender in the tween market but it also has its heart in the right place
5485097 we are deeply disappointed by the verdict and we believe there are substantial grounds for an appeal which we intend to pursue vigorously
5485098 the government has basically never publicly reviewed whether the conflict of interests rules work they dont
5485099 its one of these cases that does go right to the heart of the procurement process
5485100 we maintain that our work for the nrc was free of even the potential for a conflict of interest
5485101 our work for other customers was entirely independent of the possible nrc standards at issue in the case as it was performed in support of the department of energy a federal department that is autonomous self regulating and separate from the nrc

5485104 saic was looking at ways of taking advantage of these opportunities
5485105 saic was interested in pursuing the billions of dollars worth of business that would result from doe and other commercial nuclear facilities performing decontamination and decommissioning of their facilities
5485106 saic did not disclose this as an organizational conflict of interest relationship
5485107 if saic has an oci relationship to disclose it is not enough to simply bury it in the text of a technical proposal if there is an oci relationship it is not nrcs obligation to find it
5485108 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity

5485119 the last 24 hours ive received probably four to five thousand messages on my blackberry
5485120 every time i read a text message i cant stop smiling
5485121 he was saying everyone in america is proud of me and supporting and then he told me to give my mom a hug and tell her the president sent it
5485122 the amount of support from people following the olympics and swimming from back home its a pretty cool feeling

5485128 the area was already sited for its potential for wind power once we decided to exercise the option we saw that it was a good possibility for us a good area for wind power production
5485129 choice that we have to make regarding our energy production
5485130 at the same time that we energies is looking at clean energy sources alliant energy is proposing to build a coal fired power plant in columbia county
5485131 alliant has stated that they would prefer to build the coal plant in cassville but portage is the alternative site being considered by the public service commission
5485132 we have to begin to wean ourselves off of dirty coal and wind power is one of the best energy sources that we have to do that we hope that the public service commission agrees and focuses more on developing renewable energy sources like wind solar and biofuels that can help build a new clean energy economy instead of perpetuating our dependence on dirty coal
5485133 were generally for wind projects as long as theyre not located where they could do some other environmental damage

5485141 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands in tax breaks for people earning 2 5 million because theyre only middle class
5485142 everyone making 2 5 million or more raise your hands
5485143 i think if youre just talking about income how about five million
5485144 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5485145 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5485146 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5485147 this guy obviously does not pump his own gas he obviously does not do his own shopping he obviously does not pay his own bills

5485154 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
5485155 if it was a category 3 or 4 hurricane then wed be a lot more worried
5485156 ive seen as many people die in blob shaped storms
5485157 this system is dangerous because people dont do common sense things

5485164 its a very very fragile balance of powers right now
5485165 but the fact that commodities are declining is overall good for consumers and good for the market
5485166 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5485167 for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign as president
5485168 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future
5485169 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5485170 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5485171 most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5485172 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5485173 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5485174 after the elections the nation wanted solutions from the new government
5485175 but the politicians could not do so a personal vendetta was started
5485176 i am confident that not a single charge can stand against me
5485177 i have not done anything for my personal gain whatever i have done i have done it for pakistan
5485178 leading pakistan is not an easy task and anyone doing it comes under a lot of criticism
5485179 in the start most pakistanis were for him and he still has some supporters especially because the new government which promised to do things differently has failed to do much in the past 100 days in power
5485180 he wanted to serve the country and to be different
5485181 he brought parliamentary reforms he brought women into the parliament
5485182 he in a way always believed in a unity of command a very centralized command which means his command in fact
5485183 you have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender
5485184 this site was not just about holding images it was about a group of individuals who used this as a community to then jump off into other areas it was a meeting point
5485185 this website while appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles
5485186 thompson was a critical piece of this network he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5485187 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
5485188 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5485189 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5485190 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5485191 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5485192 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5485193 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5485194 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5485195 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5485196 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5485197 you might have a family thats having a hard time and it might take another day and thats ok
5485198 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5485199 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5485200 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5485201 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5485202 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5485203 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5485204 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5485205 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5485206 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5485207 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5485208 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5485209 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5485210 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5485211 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5485212 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5485213 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5485214 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5485215 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5485216 somebody jumped the fence and did that said the shops owner hector rodriguez
5485217 and i dont know tried to hurt us i guess
5485218 it has to be somebody that knows right here because they know very well wheres the tanks and everything
5485219 used oil is petroleum oil and it is a contaminents and so forth
5485220 so you definitely dont want it getting into any open waterways such as creeks and so forth
5485221 i was driving through and wasnt expecting it to be that high and then as soon as i saw it it was too late and the car stop and turned off
5485222 oh grocery carts mattresses wood trimmings tree trimmings you know everything anything thats it
5485223 we actually had two back to back torrential downpours and thats what did it by the time i look out the water is already rolling like a river

5485239 both of these blogs should be cut immediately from the list of credentialed sites neither functions as a responsible media outlet and both offend catholics as well as others to allow them access to the democratic national convention sends a message to catholics they will not forget we look for leah daughtry ceo of the convention to nix them asap

5485247 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5485248 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5485249 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5485250 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5485251 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5485252 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water

5485318 per affermare che luomo bello se muscoloso e la donna sexy se formosa il team di ricercatori britannici ha messo a punto uno speciale scanner ottico tridimensionale capace di catturare a grandezza naturale le caratteristiche topografiche di un corpo umano
5485319 come risultato della ricerca gli scienziati hanno messo a punto una particolare formula che definendo un
5485320 rispetto agli studi condotti in precedenza quello del dottor william brown pu vantare proprio grazie al prodigioso macchinario una precisione assoluta nei dati di misurazione dei corpi soprattutto per quanto riguarda le dimensioni e i contorni
5485321 ormai dimostrato che gli esseri umani sono attratti luno dallaltro in base ad una serie qualit genotipiche e fenotipiche ha spiegato william brown in altre parole gli uomini proprio come molte altre specie animali individuano come possibile partner quello che pu garantire una migliore riproduzione
5485322 i miei studi precedenti spiega dimostravano che la simmetria non era propriamente laspetto pi rilevante dellessere attraente ora per con questi dati pi precisi possiamo affermare che ci sono delle relazioni tra forma del corpo e attrazione le proporzioni la forma la statura sono segnali che comunicano allaltro un buono sviluppo fisico e buone condizioni di salute in molte specie la simmetria associata a sviluppo salute e successo nella riproduzione
5485323 ma dato che la simmetria corporale non un aspetto facilmente percepibile ad occhio nudo william brown conclude

5485330 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5485331 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5485332 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5485333 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

5485405 i dont think i am breaching any trust here but this was the fourth of his career i am responsible for him and really regardless of medical opinion it will be hard for me to allow him to perform again the risk is too great so i shared that sentiment with him i am sure his family will have a say as well
5485406 and i am not really pleased with how he is handling his rehab currently i would like to see more of an urgency so i am keeping him out until he learns how to handle that part of it correctly
5485407 i have been impressed i hadnt expected with his late arrival to camp and being a junior college player those two things as a combination dont lend themselves to being ready but his athleticism his knowledge his ability to learn and his demonstrated ability to play so far have been impressive
5485408 yeah i think it is going in that direction its a good thing for our team and i think we could use him either at center or guard so thats a positive
5485409 the longer we are around oneill chambers the more spectacular plays he will make we already know he has demonstrated an ability to make plays this program also develops young men in terms of their day to day accountability work ethic discipline and so a combination of all that i think will be pretty formidable by the time hes a senior but already he certainly can play football

5485420 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep

5485503 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra

5485521 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5485522 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5485523 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5485524 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them

5485526 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5485527 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5485528 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5485529 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5485530 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose

5485532 in this way supervised injection sites undercut the ethics of medical practice and set a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to let someone overdose in their care
5485533 imagine for a moment a doctor that has a patient with a serious but treatable case of cancer
5485534 there is a better alternative for injection drug users and that is treatment even if they fail treatment the first time we can help them to get up and try again
5485535 the hope is so high that it will have some effect that everybodys asking for it
5485536 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5485537 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5485538 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5485539 the assumption in the past was that either you know how to look or you dont
5485540 this is not true you can train people to look educators as well as artists know that
5485541 quite often when students miss a diagnosis they tell us they didnt look
5485542 we trained students to become literate in talking to patients but we didnt have a way to make them be visually literate
5485543 you can look at a face and observe certain aspects of it like lines on a face the colour of it the colour of the eyelids the colour of the lips these are all things once you are trained to look for it you do better at it
5485544 not only how to look at body and face but to look at patterns the work of jackson pollock has no face and no body so what is important is pattern recognition
5485545 they have to be able to look at the human being they have to be able to pick up cues that are not necessarily communicated verbally so much is not communicated verbally
5485546 the common factor here which is the human is so subjective the science that we practise is so subjective that you have to train the physician to be good at both the human brings the science and the art together
5485547 a lot of them pick it up as an avocation
5485548 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5485549 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5485550 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5485551 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5485552 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5485553 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5485554 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5485555 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5485556 highlights the need for international fact finding missions in georgia
5485557 as the family has gotten older we havent used it as much as in the past

5485578 customs officials continued to monitor for the smuggling of bibles and other religious material into the country
5485579 religious texts published without authorization including bibles and qurans may be confiscated
5485580 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
5485581 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
5485582 we firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries
5485583 keeps to the concept of putting peoples interest first and is devoted to maintaining and promoting basic rights and freedom of its citizens
5485584 chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law
5485585 were being inconvenienced a little but its nothing compared to what our brothers and sisters in china experience for their faith in jesus christ
5485586 theyve learned you might go to federal prison if they do
5485587 conduct illegal drug transactions while armed im familiar with the well established tradition of punishing responsible peaceable gun owners for the actions of criminals but i hadnt expected it to be so casually admitted to by one of the practitioners

5485589 underneath all our security issues lies our inability to write defect free code solve that and weve solved the security issues focus on the security alone and we wont solve anything
5485590 we the kings for an exciting co headline romp scheduled for october and november
5485591 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5485592 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5485593 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5485594 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5485595 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5485596 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5485597 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5485598 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5485599 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5485600 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama

5485602 todav a estamos resolviendo los casos pero la memoria concluir que algunos bancos no han actuado con diligencia
5485603 llevo m s de tres semanas intentando que mi banco ejecute el aval por los 50 000 euros que adelant para una plaza de aparcamiento que no he recibido en el plazo acordado todo lo que he encontrado en el banco son t cnicas dilatorias
5485604 la idea de esta normativa era dar seguridad a las compras sobre plano el problema es que nadie preve a que con la crisis actual tantas inmobiliarias se quedar an sin dinero para pagar a los constructores y que ser amos tantos compradores los que reclamar amos la devoluci n en el banco de espa a me han dicho que han recibido muchas quejas parecidas y que lo nico que pod a hacer era demandar a mi banco o eso o montar un esc ndalo en la sucursal
5485605 la entidad bancaria tiene que preguntar a la promotora si ha incumplido alg n punto del contrato como los plazos de entrega en caso afirmativo la ejecuci n del aval tiene que ser autom tica
5485606 antes la primera interesada en ejecutar el aval era la inmobiliaria ten a montones de personas a las que le pod a vender el piso a un precio superior los consumidores aguantaban los retrasos y lo normal era un periodo de gracia de tres meses ahora las tornas se han dado la vuelta
5485607 lo ltimo que me han dicho en la oficina del banco es que su cliente es el promotor no yo y ya no s qu hacer
5485608 la ley es expl cita siempre que se cumplan las condiciones es obligatorio ejecutar el aval al margen de la situaci n de la empresa
5485609 so i think those who come here will have an extraordinary time but the colleagues who dont come are staying at home only because they have tough races if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
5485610 enquanto n o houver outra determina o cabe infraero cumprir o planejamento estabelecido
5485611 walls in the building have to come down and be stored upstairs and thats what were doing now course our garden still kinda behind us all has to go away the gazebo is already on its way back to charleston

5485613 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge

5485617 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5485618 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5485619 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5485620 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5485621 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5485622 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5485623 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5485624 one would have to assume that its going to be this week
5485625 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
5485626 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
5485627 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5485628 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
5485629 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
5485630 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
5485631 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5485632 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
5485633 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5485634 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5485635 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5485636 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5485637 this time im going to treat you like the little slut that you are
5485638 kane isnt the only one who likes to play with fire
5485639 besides striker who was money again my ecw hat goes off to mark henry again this week
5485640 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
5485641 the best part of raw was mike adamle people who criticize this guy need to
5485642 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
5485643 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
5485644 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5485645 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
5485646 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
5485647 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5485648 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5485649 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5485650 they had stiff alibis or they were not in a position to take the material for purposes of this kind
5485651 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5485652 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5485653 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5485654 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5485655 karl rove has already declared congressman steve kagen their 1 candidate to beat in 2008

5485663 with the situation here i felt i needed to do something that was important to me
5485664 i had a great experience at nc state and it was a special place for me over the last two and a half years the entire coaching staff and the support staff have been great to me i want to thank them and my teammates for being there for me i wish them all the best
5485665 je kon horen dat ze maar bleef doorgaan want ze stond direct achter het gordijn van het podium

5485667 we hadden een heel passionele relatie maar haar angst om als lesbienne geopenbaard te worden dreef ons uit elkaar

5485669 ik voel me goed ik ben al negen kilo aangekomen en dat terwijl ik misschien wel dood had kunnen zijn ik ben cht een wonder
5485670 ik hou wel van een zwaar work out regime en wonderwel slaag ik er in het vol te houden

5485706 haas and creamer were will aware of my intention to conduct my dissertation research at the site since 2001 and on a number of subsquent sic occasions to 2004 at the society for american archaeology meetings in montreal i or my advisor james b richardson iii have had the opportunity to indicate to them that dependent upon funding i would be working at the site in 2004 or 2005
5485707 this is another case of haas and creamers lack of acknowledgement of previous and ongoing work at late preceramic sites on the peruvian north central coast by peruvian archaeologists for bandurria has been long recognized from the research of dr fung as a key site for our understanding of the rise of late preceramic temple centers this selective amnesia on the part of haas and creamer has to stop
5485708 peruvian archaeologists have and are making great progress in reconstructing their own cultural record without any help from foreign archaeologists
5485709 en el referido art culo creamer declara que espera excavar en bandurria que se encuentra virtualmente sin excavar antes que sucumba a la presi n de las urbanizadoras dando a entender que el sitio carece de investigaciones y que est desamparado

5485717 at first i thought that it was silly but it seems to be working
5485718 i like the flexibility to handle a mission the way i want the biggest thing for us now is to help these people realize that they are the chief authority and they can ask for things that they need
5485719 previously the security situation was very bad and this area was under the control of the insurgency groups
5485720 now it is much better our challenge now is comprehensive reform to go to the second phase of improving water electricity sanitation education and health

5485722 there is no trust between the local government and the provincial government because there are no rules and regulation regarding the budget
5485723 we can win the military battle any time but to win the support of the iraqis we need to encourage their economic development
5485724 i thought my meal was a bit more ingredient driven than i expected i checked my notes from dinner there two years ago and my first meal did seem more technically flashy with more unusual flavour and texture combinations
5485725 im kind of obsessed about the quality of the ingredients and where they came from
5485726 were very focused on staying local wherever possible meaning for me within the district of barcelona failing that catalonia failing that spain and then if required outside of spain
5485727 ive been making it since dinner party days i read about the famous larp ge egg dish of yolk whipping cream sherry vinegar maple syrup and rock salt that sounds like french toast but served in a different way
5485728 this dish is about individual elements working together in perfect harmony

5485730 prasco got so paranoid about infringing patents from competitors medicis pharmaceutical and imaginative research associates that it filed a declaratory judgment motion the problem for pasco was that prasco wasnt even on the defendants radar screens the district court pitched the case and the appeals court concurred
5485731 as for the prizes he advocates i think theyre privately funded
5485732 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5485733 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5485734 that the team is not about landon donovan and david beckham its about all of us its we its us its not i and its not me
5485735 if we work together as a group we can achieve things
5485736 he has an understanding of our strengths as a team and more importantly our weaknesses
5485737 we stepped out on the training field today and unlike any training session weve had all year we immediately addressed those and we worked on them
5485738 our mentality cant be that we can outscore the other team 5 4 we need all 11 of us to think defense we have to give away nothing so that we can give our special players who are special opportunities to get their chances and win the game for us
5485739 is going to bring a standard of quality hes going to define his expectations from the guys and demand that they meet those expectations

5485744 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5485745 musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaida the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world for this he has our deep gratitude
5485746 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5485747 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists

5485749 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5485750 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5485751 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5485752 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5485753 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5485754 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5485755 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5485756 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5485757 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5485758 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5485759 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5485760 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5485761 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5485762 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5485763 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5485764 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5485765 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5485766 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5485767 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5485768 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5485769 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5485770 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
5485771 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5485772 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5485773 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5485774 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5485775 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5485776 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5485777 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5485778 momenteel is een man overleden en zijn er twee personen zeer ernstig gewond
5485779 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5485780 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5485781 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5485782 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5485783 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5485784 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5485785 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5485786 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5485787 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5485788 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5485789 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5485790 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5485791 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5485792 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5485793 who are open to doing something on the production side
5485794 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5485795 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5485796 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5485797 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5485798 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5485799 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5485800 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5485801 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5485802 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5485803 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5485804 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5485805 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5485806 i go out six out of seven nights a week to one or two or three events a night i dont get enough sleep i probably get maybe five hours on a good night i always make sure any hotel im staying at has internet access before i agree to stay there

5485810 we wont get improvement until we educate and train business managers as both project clients and steering committee members
5485811 how can a government oversight agency such as omb charged primarily with budget oversight be effective when they also assume responsibility for
5485812 what i may be seeing from his comments is a lack of interest because hes so busy elsewhere but the desire to learn and grow with new technology is critical to understanding and leading a country i believe
5485813 it seems like the same people who designed the system which they now believe broken are the ones who are now looking for fall guys
5485814 the difficulty that we are faced with is that our budget has been flat for the last five years
5485815 in real dollars weve lost almost fifteen per cent purchasing power

5485825 each day when they put on their uniforms our law enforcement officers place themselves in harms way to protect and serve the people of texas in turn texans should have the opportunity to do their part to help these officers in their time of need
5485826 the blue alert program will be a powerful tool that leverages the eyes and ears of many toward the apprehension of criminals who threaten our protectors
5485827 a tremendous amount of fear mongering bullying and ill will towards my restaurant from local restaurant owners and the like in the neighborhood

5485829 if you are the new guy on the block and not in everybody elses back pocket or part of old little italy you apparently do not have a prayer of making it

5485832 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5485833 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5485834 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5485835 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5485836 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5485837 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5485838 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5485839 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year

5485847 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5485848 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5485849 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5485850 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5485851 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5485852 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5485853 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5485854 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5485855 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5485856 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5485857 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5485858 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5485862 it is important to encourage creative writing in the schools and cultivate students interest in the arts
5485863 the playwright discovery program does both it also provides the opportunity of a lifetime to a young person the chance to see his or her play produced at the nations cultural center
5485864 many people focus on the behavioral anomalies of those with autism without ever stopping to wonder how the persons mind works
5485865 as a case in point i am often called to task for my refusal to endorse attempts to christianize the constitution and portray such an adventure as either conservatism or acceptable i always ask to be directed to a relevant word or phrase anywhere in the text of that document that shows it was intended to be an adjunct to any religious manuscript or philosophy as of todays date there have been no successful takers but i am still regularly accosted and berated for secularizing an entirely secular product regardless of any sympathy i may have for the religion of my fathers i cannot let comfortable convenience override obvious facts the latest assault on my conservative credentials grew from the submission to this site a few days ago entitled in god we trust all others pay yen neighbors reading it were upset at my lack of respect for religion and its role in the affairs of men they feel that religious reasoning is an important component of conservatism it is my position theyre talking about personal or social conservatism not political conservatism i fully understand the desire and temptation to link all roads sporting the name conservatism into one superhighway leading to political and social unity admittedly there are points of intersection but there are subtle differences as well one of which is the fact that political conservatism is related to a written document that has standing in secular law i justified my sardonic take on president bushs call for religious freedom in china not as an attack on the personal beliefs of mr bush or anyone else but from the rationalization that if our constitution calls for separation of church and state it would seem to follow it calls for separation of church and state policy especially international policy
5485866 this nation guarantees freedom of religion and offers protection for its practice which i fully support but it has no statutory implied or inferred mandate to advance religion domestically or internationally our religious missionaries have the same freedom to travel where their business takes them as do corporate executives and the government rightfully has an interest in the welfare of citizens abroad but a secular officer such as the president should not use the agency of the united states to facilitate religious activity as an extension of national foreign policy to do so is an unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of other nations is it the place of the chinese leader to weigh in on our national debate on universal health care the founders acknowledged a creator and many were privately associated with churches and religious organizations but they purposely drafted the political structure of government as a secular construct not to insult religion but to free the consciences of all men from the domination of the religious beliefs and opinions of others if my understanding of the matter is correct i am obligated as a conservative to separate the inclinations arising from the presidents personal religious beliefs from his duties of office
5485867 another point of contention was my implication that americans merely want the label and not the substance of religion in those regions of intellect that govern the decision making of presidents i will stand by this but admit clarification would be helpful i am not accusing anyone of hypocrisy for preferring candidates grounded in the moral principles and life philosophies similar to those they wish as constituents i am suggesting however that due to various and sundry mechanisms of human nature history and habit voters expect religious bearing and morality in the personality presentation of office seekers but once elected want and demand caesarian rationality in the practice of statecraft
5485868 i am fully supportive of religion and the refinements it offers to untutored human nature but can also accept that the divinical model is not the only path to moral edification personally or politically i will also make the assertion that conservatism is best served when the focus is not on inappropriate tangential and artificially imposed orthodoxy and more about constitutional orthopraxis the separation of church and state is about more than abolishing public tithes to church establishments and many conservatives simply dont want to accept this reality the latest episodes having both candidates address issues of faith and answering questions about evil i feel is more disturbing than edifying there was evil on earth when jesus arrived and evil remained after he departed there have been over forty u s presidents and evil remains what power conferred by the constitution gives the expectation the next president will be more successful in the eradication of evil and who defines evil

5485881 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5485882 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5485883 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5485884 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5485891 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5485892 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient

5485915 the government of peru recognizes the authorship of the archaeologist ruth shady in the evaluation of the antiquity of the archaeological site of caral
5485916 the principle of safeguarding the authorship rights of the peruvian investigators
5485917 in this manner overcoming any misunderstanding and having recognized the responsibility of dr ruth shady in this important discovery it would be possible to encourage collaborative relations between the national team of the caral project and the cultural institutions of the united states interested in it
5485918 confirm the emergence and development of a major cultural complex in this region during the late archaic period
5485919 extensive excavations in the 1990s at the supe valley site of caral
5485920 for several years haass team has excavated a site near the norte chico town of caral
5485921 all of these findings supported the early theory that the inland norte chico communities probably grew cotton and traded it for fish to coastal fishermen who used the cotton to make nets
5485922 working in the north central coast of peru creamer and haas have identified 25 major yet previously undocumented archeological sites in three adjoining valleys all dating to 3000 and 1800 bc the same time the pyramids of egypt were being constructed among these is the site of caral dated to 2627 bc that appears to be the oldest city in the new world
5485923 how can the space coast trust john mccain when he has failed us so many other times in the senate chairman mccain was the one man that could have stood up to prevent the space flight gap and save thousands of space coast jobs however as is the case with so many other issues mccain instead stood with president bush and to add insult to injury mccain fought against nasa funding calling it pork barrel spending
5485924 while residents of the space coast were looking for an open dialogue about space policy john mccain opted instead for a closed door meeting with hand picked people unfortunately it is not surprising that mccain would take yet another page from the bush rove playbook since he is afraid to defend his failed record on nasa issues
5485925 statements on space are a confusing and contradictory muddle ranging from freezing nasa spending to extending the shuttle program
5485926 mr chairman space flight you cant do it on the cheap and i just dont think that a billion dollar increase over five years thats 200 million a year is going to do it and i would love for you to explain on the reprogramming of the 11 billion over that five years how you can do that i think my other concern is i would not like to see repeated the period of time between 1975 and 1981 when we were down and not flying with humans when apollo soyuz last flew and the space shuttle was supposed to fly three years later it wasnt until 81 a total of six years that we were down and my concern in what youve outlined and what the president outlined in the speech over at nasa headquarters is that you phase out the space shuttle by 2010 and then if we dont fly this new vehicle until four five six years later that means that our only human access to space is that we have to rely on russian rockets and european rockets and i dont think thats good for the country and so rather than having a hiatus i would love to have you comment as to how we might have an overlap where we would keep the space shuttle flying until such time as the other vehicle is already tested and ready to fly
5485927 the second point i would ask about is the concern about the start stop stop start and the continuity of the work force we now as you know quite well in michoud in new orleans have this huge facility with thousands of employees and my real concern as i look at the presidents plan that well probably have as much as a five year gap after the shuttle has completed its work and the time that we start with this new cev vehicle that is now only in the very minute planning stages what do we do to keep the continuity of the work force im really concerned these folks if they lose the work theyre gone you have to restart re stop how do we address that continuity of service that is so necessary to get what you need to accomplish
5485928 it is a critical factor that we really need to work the details of that have got a few years out thats not to say were not going to start right now trying to sort through what those consequences are at least the next four years youre looking at production of the external tank et cetera that are necessary to fly shuttle there are a number of different options that will look at shuttle derived approaches for lift capability for the project constellation exploration vehicle thats not yet determined and were looking for creative ideas from the industry to do that im not convinced theres going to be a gap or a hiatus there because again part of what is in the dialogue with senator nelson a little bit earlier what were pursuing is an acquisition strategy of a spiral development of which the first spiral of the project constellation exploration vehicle unmanned will be launched as early as 08 and a little bit later this decade
5485929 specifically the senate voted to add 1 billion on top of the 10 billion the bill already provided to nasa i continue to support nasa and space research but at what cost to our nations children who will inherit the largest national debt this country has seen again i would like to express my disappointment that senate leadership has brought to the floor a bill that is 3 billion over the presidents request containing more than 600 earmarks in my recent travels around the nation i hear again and again from citizens who are fed up with porkbarrel spending and yet congress fails to listen it is a shame and i can only hope that the american people will join me and the president in expressing their displeasure with this bill i hope that the remaining six appropriations bills do not contain such rampant and reckless spending and that congress works to regain some fiscal discipline
5485930 mccain spoke at carnegie mellon university here this morning and laid out his plan for the future of the economy
5485931 means it would take longer and cost more to get the moon program rolling providing the freeze didnt lead to the project getting whacked which it could
5485932 the only power of government that could stop them was the power of veto and it was rarely used if that authority is entrusted to me i will use the veto as needed and as the founders intended i will veto every bill with earmarks until the congress stops sending bills with earmarks i will seek a constitutionally valid line item veto to end the practice once and for all
5485933 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5485934 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5485935 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5485936 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5485937 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5485938 this walgreens is a den of obscenity a location where birth control pills condoms lubricants and pregnancy tests are being sold a stones throw from both st ann elementary school and aaaa driving school
5485939 walgreens lures these children into the store with their discounts on twizzlers and jujubes which are conveniently located not far from the fruit flavored lubes
5485940 hmmm we realize that someone cannot mention everything in one column so that these are selected things that professor clayson has learned i am sorry that he has chosen to publish such negative stuff since there is a lot more to learn
5485941 i would just like to mention that calling those holding an opposing view stupid is nothing new
5485942 mccain is still considered the republican candidate for president while edwards is not
5485943 i have heard over and over again about mccains affair what channel are you watching i think it is one of the only things the democrats have that and showing pics over and over of mccain with bush as if because he took a pic with him he is just like him
5485944 jeroze doyou read anything other than left wing talking points
5485945 the polls are tied yet i cant find anything reporting that bit of info here or on the national sites why
5485946 what does it matter if mccain had an affair its common knowledge that obama had an affair as well
5485947 today prof clayson denounces the press for its religious reverence to obama he then tries to prove it by providing three examples
5485948 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits
5485949 jeroze you are right on mccains affair i did not see the entire saddle back event i was watching the swimming
5485950 cross you kill me every week i cant help but think you read a different article than me each week because your generalizations of claysons intent and meaning behind is writing seams to be much different than what i read
5485951 i dont get it the title says it all now liberals everywhere are trying to say clayson did not learn these things
5485952 cire asks what does it matter if mccain had an affair
5485953 cross is your goal to be insulting to people because if it is you are surely reaching your goals
5485954 sorry cire i wont take you seriously anymore and please dont take what i just wrote seriously
5485955 if you watched that youtube video and thought they were being serious im beyond concerned
5485956 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5485957 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere

5485962 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5485963 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5485964 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5485965 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5485966 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5485967 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5485968 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5485969 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease

5485989 ich denke wir haben gut nach vorne gespielt der platzverweis hat uns dann aus dem konzept gebracht

5485991 wir haben zu wenig nach vorne getan deshalb kann ich mit dem spiel nicht zufrieden sein
5485992 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5485993 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5485994 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5485995 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5485996 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5485997 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5485998 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5485999 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5486000 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5486001 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5486002 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5486003 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5486004 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5486005 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5486006 our results demonstrate that the most effective way of creating value is through growth both organically and through acquisitions however we are now at a crossroads
5486007 our ability to continue creating value within the trust structure is constrained as we cannot efficiently access capital to fund growth the non hazardous solid waste services sector is undergoing a period of consolidation particularly in the u s market and we anticipate significant opportunities that we need to be in a position to act upon in order to continue to pursue our strategic growth objectives we require an equity that reflects our financial and operating performance we also require a structure that does not limit our growth or our foreign ownership levels and a structure through which we can efficiently access capital markets we believe the conversion to a corporate structure is fundamental to the future success of our business
5486008 given our anticipation of significant acquisition opportunities especially in the u s non hazardous solid waste services market the tuck in acquisitions that we are continually negotiating and our organic growth requirements my fellow trustees and i have decided to reduce our distributions to unitholders in order to direct more cash flow towards investments in growth therefore effective december 1 2008 we are changing our distribution policy to a monthly distribution of 0 04166 per unit

5486114 we write this note to our colleagues with some sadness we have no desire to get into a public debate with dr ruth shady sol s about the recognized discoveries in the norte chico region of the peruvian coast
5486115 the sacred city of caral supe the origins of the andean civilization and the formation of the pristine state in ancient peru
5486116 our first meeting with dr shady took place in april 1999 when haas invited her to present a paper at a conference on the biological and cultural aspects of the el ni o phenomenon held at the field museum we had heard about dr shadys work through colleagues in the united states and we were very excited about the research we went to peru for two weeks and stayed with dr shady in her home we visited caral briefly for two days and got to know other early sites along the coast with her and her students
5486117 will begin a project this summer in peru july 2000 investigating the historical relationship between the el ni o phenomenon and the growth of complex society in caral a village about 100 miles north of lima where pyramids were built 4 000 years ago
5486118 in 2000 haas came to peru in may and was invited by dr shady to spend the season in the house she had built in caral with her students and her team he also wanted to visit other sites in the supe valley and see whether there were more early sites in the neighboring valleys of huaura pativilca and fortaleza to accompany him in his field trips dr shady introduced him to the archaeologist lvaro ruiz at the end of july 2000 haas and creamer went to the field with dr shady and her assistant marco machacuay to take a series of fresh samples we have many photographs that show haas and creamer working with shady during the two days of the taking of samples for radiocarbon testing
5486119 the results of the testing were known in december 2000 and gave datings that confirmed that caral was occupied in the third millennium b c it was during this time that haas and creamer were informed of the existence of the datings of previous samples all the data were consistent and confirmed a continuous occupation from the years 2600 to 2000 b c
5486120 with the full cooperation of dr shady haas prepared the draft of an article to send to the scientific magazine science it was then that the source of the present problems arose much of the publicity in the united states although not all see newsweek april 2001 cited haas and or creamer as the main researchers for reasons of her own dr shady declined to give interviews to different reports we were consternated and disgusted with the publicity and at that time we sent a public apology and clarification which were amply distributed explaining our very minor role in any work done at caral the press release cited by dr shady was the initial launching on the article in science magazine effected by the field museum this was formally corrected as soon as possible at that time we expected dr shady to send her press release through her office but this did not happen
5486121 field museum anthropologists establish date and importance of the americas oldest city
5486122 archaeologists say peru was home to the americas earliest known urban settlements and pyramids dating as far back as 2627 b c
5486123 archaeologists say peru was home to the americas oldest pyramids cities
5486124 according to niu archaeologist winifred creamer this contemporary example of a cane and mud structure is similar to the lower class dwellings used by ancient peruvians at caral
5486125 according to niu archaeologist winifred creamer this contemporary example of a simple irrigation system in the supe valley near caral is probably very similar to the system used by ancient peruvians
5486126 front cover photograph by dr jonathan haas kasia szremski imsa 01 and lyra haas imsa 05 at archaeological site in caral peru caral the oldest known urban center in the americas was discovered by imsa mentors dr winifred creamer and dr jonathan haas
5486127 have we disseminated our last article published in nature yes we believe that 95 new radiocarbon datings of 13 sites that had not previously been examined and that show a sound range of datings from 3000 to 1800 b c deserve attention
5486128 the latest article in nature describes the work of our project in the valleys of pativilca and fortaleza dr shady had no participation in this work in terms of assigning credits for previous research in the norte chico region we recognize that the first radiocarbon datings in sites of the late archaic were published by elzbieta zechenter a polish archaeologist who wrote her thesis on the supe valley in 1988 the explorations in the supe valley were carried out by two peruvians carlos williams and manuel merino and published in manuscript form in 1979 michael moseley wrote about spero in the 1970s and his graduate student robert feldman published articles based on his thesis on research in spero in the early 1980s al these investigations are cited in our article in nature shadys research in caral is explicitly cited in the first paragraph of the article and appears in references five times in different parts of the article
5486129 had had this intuition also but did not dare to put it forward
5486130 we use the term norte chico to describe the area that includes the valleys of huaura supe pativilca and fortaleza because this is the term used locally we also think that it is a representation that extends beyond one single valley and site
5486131 in the course of our project we have tried hard to develop ample cooperation with many peruvian institutions and archaeologists we understand that we are foreigners in peru and we feel a strong obligation to make positive contributions to the archaeological community in peru and to the small towns in the norte chico creamer spent five months in peru teaching in universidad peruana cayetano heredia and she has given a series of public lectures with other members of the project in universities of lima in the norte chico and in the peruvian archaeologists association
5486132 to give support to the archaeological community at large we set up a scholarship program which enables peruvian students to travel to perform their postgraduate archaeology studies currently there are four peruvian students with these scholarships it is true that one of these scholarships was recently obtained by the assistant director of the project lvaro ruiz but the scholarship funds have also been awarded to another three peruvian students who are not directly linked with our project
5486133 we are disillusioned with dr shady s recent statements about our project we respect dr shady and what she has done at caral at the same time we believe that it is important to recognize that there is a large number of sites with monumental architecture in the norte chico region and we are only just starting to understand the full significance of this unique cultural system that originated more than 5 000 years ago on the peruvian coast we have always openly admitted that other researchers uhle kosok engel williams and merino zechenter moseley feldman fung silva vega centeno and shady have all of them made great contributions to our understanding of the early occupations in the norte chico region these scholars provide the basis on which we are constructing our present project we could not do what we have been doing without the works of our predecessors our immediate contribution to the archaeology of the norte chico is to provide a sound chronology for the occupation of the late archaic in the region and to place this occupation in an ample chronological regional and global context
5486134 those interested in our work on the norte chico archaeological project please visit the web site of the project at our reports to the instituto nacional de cultura perus national institute of culture are posted on this site as well as our applications for funding and photographs of the sites we have researched we encourage those interested to examine our latest proposal submitted to the national science foundation where the work of dr shady is discussed at length
5486135 in the search for the origins of human civilization winifred creamer and jonathan haas at northern illinois university and the field museum respectively have discovered a complex society on the coast of peru that predates the inca and other forms of civilization in the western hemisphere working in the north central coast of peru creamer and haas have identified 25 major yet previously undocumented archaeological sites in three adjoining valleys all dating to 3000 and 1800 bc the same time the pyramids of egypt were being constructed the related sites referred to as the norte chico complex appears to be the earliest centralized hierarchical complex civilization in the americas among these is the site of caral dated to 2627 bc that appears to be the oldest city in the new world the sites all share enormous platform mounds round ceremonial plazas and extensive areas of socially stratified residences
5486136 but i see that r james woolsey a former director of the c i a serves on the board of american congress for truth your educational foundation

5486138 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5486139 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5486140 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5486141 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5486142 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5486143 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5486144 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5486145 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5486146 to some degree these people can be role models in terms of showing our current students that they have a lot of opportunities to advance
5486147 he was obviously uncomfortable and we were uncomfortable you cant just develop policy on the spot so not knowing who this person was i had no idea what his standards were and i think we certainly had the discretion to ask him to leave
5486148 im an independent reporter who does original research and has a record of being credentialed
5486149 i dont think theres any question im a member of the media
5486150 sign whatever it is the favored members of the media have to sign swear to whatever they have to swear to
5486151 americans need to get over the political bigotry that there are only two parties
5486152 must be astonishing to canadians who have a multiparty system
5486153 mainstream political parties can essentially cooperate in failing to even attempt to solve problems faced by a majority of citizens usually because they have been funded and supported in other ways by large corporations
5486154 naders presidential campaign as with other similar past campaigns by independents and third parties serve the purpose of educating people about the huge gaps in the mainstream parties platforms
5486155 not stupid theyve developed a highly proficient way of censoring themselves
5486156 until these loopholes are closed you will continue to see regular dishonest unethical secretive unrepresentative and wasteful actions by governments and corporations
5486157 hello americans cut the crap stop making excuses and take over
5486158 protest the corporate control over our political system and to call for opening the presidential debates
5486159 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5486160 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining
5486161 efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5486162 to go from a small town like taunton and go to america and do all the research he does especially this as part of the nobel peace prize is a great achievement
5486163 literacy civil rights he was always there and thats why were all here for him

5486177 our goal is to provide low income homeowners with access to renewable energy solutions designed to decrease energy consumption and reduce energy bills
5486178 for this program we installed solar hot water systems in various climate zones across the state and will monitor the efficiency of the solar hot water heating systems
5486179 with hobolink we can view the data anytime anywhere we have access to the internet
5486180 the ability to view data remotely allows us to see how the hot water heating units are performing without having to go back into the field to manually collect the data
5486181 since no one in our state has ever monitored the natural gas usage associated with a solar water heating unit we wanted to track the consumption of gas when the solar power was on versus when the solar power was turned off
5486182 this is the kind of data we needed to see
5486183 we wanted to determine whether or not the systems were performing the way we hoped they would the data showed us that during the day there is no need for the systems gas or the electric power to turn on and this will ultimately save homeowners money
5486184 we plan on using the hobo u30 systems on each of the 22 test homes for the pilot study
5486185 we hope to have comparison data on all of the solar hot water hearing systems by next year
5486186 hes just kind of marking time hes just kind of waiting for the ax to fall thats all
5486187 graduates yearn to work for companies that guarantee them opportunity to develop their careers with payment coming as second priority
5486188 only 7 were keen on self employment the rest want job hunting
5486189 attention will be put on districts that are hard to reach
5486190 we particularly encourage women and people with disabilities to apply
5486191 all applicants will be expected to channel their applications through their head teachers
5486192 this is the issue we are trying to put right the land bill has no threat at all
5486193 there is no way customary land owners can be affected because the constitution protects your land the constitution is supreme to the land bill so there is nothing to worry about
5486194 in teso we have built schools more than any other government has done before what kind of marginalisation are you talking about
5486195 i am not god or a magician the things we do we do them through sweat we are moving step by step a child cannot be born today and it competes in the olympics tomorrow
5486196 a citizen of uganda of eighteen years and above who voluntarily acquires the citizenship of a country other than uganda may retain citizenship of uganda subject to the constitution
5486197 substantial amounts of money lawfully acquired and be willing to take the oath of allegiance
5486198 we dont want to create confusion how do you become a president of another country at the sometime you are a citizen of another country its the same thing with security heads they are trusted with the countries security information and we cant risk giving them duo citizenship
5486199 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5486200 my recent experience of them is that theyre not john le carre graham greene its not that sort of tableau anymore

5486205 un d a mientras nos encontr bamos trabajando en lima con las fotos a reas de esta parte del valle se refiere al valle medio de supe michael emocionado corri hacia mi mesa y exclam mira estas ruinas tan peculiares que he encontrado si la formas de estas ruinas son muy particulares no se parecen en nada a los cientos de sitios que hemos ubicado anteriormente en las fotos a reas
5486206 la impresi n dada por las ruinas se refiere a caral es que debi ser un centro ceremonial complejo aunque diferente tanto en forma como en disposici n del resto de los otros centros de la costa peruana la virtual ausencia de fragmentos de cer mica en el sitio hace cualquier c lculo preciso de su edad relativa imposible

5486209 nuestro primer encuentro con la dra shady se dio en el mes de abril de 1999 cuando haas la invit a asistir para presentar un trabajo en una conferencia sobre los aspectos biol gicos y culturales del fen meno el ni o llevada a cabo en el museo field nosotros hab amos escuchado del trabajo de la dra shady por colegas en los estados unidos y est bamos muy emocionados acerca de la investigaci n fuimos al per por dos semanas y permanecimos con la dra shady en su casa visitamos caral brevemente por dos d as y conocimos otros sitios tempranos a lo largo de la costa con ella y sus estudiantes
5486210 will begin a project this summer in peru julio de 2000 investigating the historical relationship between the el ni o phenomenon and the growth of complex society in caral a village about 100 miles north of lima where pyramids were built 4 000 years ago
5486211 en el 2000 haas vino al per en mayo y fue invitado por la dra shady a pasar la temporada en la casa que hab a construido en caral con sus estudiantes y equipo l tambi n quer a visitar otros sitios en el valle de supe y ver si hab an sic m s sitios tempranos en los valles vecinos de huaura pativilca y fortaleza para acompa arlo en sus viajes de campo la dra shady le present al arque logo lvaro ruiz a fines de julio del 2000 haas y creamer fueron al campo con la dra shady y su asistente marco machacuay a tomar una serie de nuevas muestras tenemos abundantes fotograf as que muestran a haas y creamer trabajando con shady durante los dos d as de la toma de muestras radiocarb nicas
5486212 los resultados de las pruebas se conocieron en diciembre del 2000 y arrojaron fechados que confirmaban que caral fue ocupado en el 3er milenio a c fue durante este tiempo que haas y creamer fueron informados de la existencia de fechados de anteriores muestras todos los datos fueron consistentes y confirmaron una ocupaci n continua desde los a os 2600 a 2000 a c

5486216 according to niu archaeologist winifred creamer this contemporary example of a cane and mud structure is similar to the lower class dwellings used by ancient peruvians at caral
5486217 according to niu archaeologist winifred creamer this contemporary example of a simple irrigation system in the supe valley near caral is probably very similar to the system used by ancient peruvians

5486219 hemos difundido nuestro ltimo art culo publicado en nature si nosotros creemos que 95 nuevos fechados radiocarb nicos de 13 sitios que no hab an sido examinados previamente y que demuestran un s lido rango de fechados desde el 3000 al 1800 a c merecen atenci n
5486220 el ltimo art culo en nature describe el trabajo de nuestro proyecto en los valles de pativilca y fortaleza la dra shady no tuvo participaci n alguna en este trabajo en t rminos de la asignaci n de cr ditos por investigaciones previas realizadas en la regi n del norte chico nosotros reconocemos que los primeros fechados radiocarb nicos en sitios del arcaico tard o fueron publicados por elzbieta zechenter una arque loga polaca quien escribi su tesis sobre el valle de supe en 1988 las exploraciones del valle de supe fueron realizadas por dos peruanos carlos williams y manuel merino y publicados en un manuscrito en 1979 michael moseley escribi acerca de spero en los 70s y su estudiante graduado robert feldman public art culos basados en su tesis sobre la investigaci n en spero a inicios de los 80s todas estas investigaciones est n citadas en nuestro art culo en nature la investigaci n de shady en caral est expl citamente citada en el primer p rrafo del art culo y aparece referenciada cinco veces a lo largo del mismo
5486221 lo hab a intuido tambi n pero no se atrevi a plantearlo
5486222 usamos el t rmino norte chico para describir el rea que incluye los valles de huaura supe pativilca y fortaleza porque ste es el t rmino que es usado localmente tambi n pensamos que es una representaci n que se extiende m s all de un solo valle y sitio
5486223 en el curso de nuestro proyecto hemos tratado fuertemente de desarrollar una amplia colaboraci n con m ltiples instituciones peruanas y arque logos nacionales
5486224 para apoyar a la amplia comunidad arqueol gica iniciamos un programa de becas que permite a estudiantes peruanos viajar para realizar sus estudios de postgrado en arqueolog a hay actualmente cuatro estudiantes peruanos con estas becas es verdad que una de estas becas fue obtenida recientemente por el co director del proyecto lvaro ruiz pero los fondos de las becas tambi n han sido otorgados a otros tres estudiantes peruanos quienes no est n directamente vinculados con nuestro proyecto
5486225 nosotros estamos desilusionados con las ltimas afirmaciones de la dra shady acerca de nuestro proyecto respetamos a la dra shady y lo que ha realizado en caral al mismo tiempo creemos que es importante reconocer que hay una gran cantidad de sitios con arquitectura monumental en la regi n del norte chico y reci n estamos empezando a comprender el completo significado de este nico sistema cultural que se origina hace m s de 5000 a os en la costa peruana nosotros siempre hemos reconocido abiertamente que otros investigadores uhle kosok engel williams y merino zechenter moseley feldman fung silva vega centeno y shady han hecho todos largas contribuciones a nuestro entendimiento de las ocupaciones tempranas en la regi n del norte chico estos estudiosos proveen la base sobre la cual estamos construyendo nuestro presente proyecto nosotros no podr amos hacer lo que venimos haciendo sin los trabajos de nuestros predecesores nuestra inmediata contribuci n a la arqueolog a del norte chico es dar una s lida cronolog a para la ocupaci n del arcaico tard o de la regi n y colocar esta ocupaci n en un amplio contexto cronol gico regional y global

5486228 no es la primera vez que personajes con poca tica profesional o cient fica vali ndose de que frecuentan c rculos influyentes tratan de apropiarse de descubrimientos de peruanos pero esta vez hay que impedirlo
5486229 es necesario una acci n inmediata porque existen en el mundo normas muy claras sobre derechos de autor a intelectual adem s del reconocimiento al trabajo de ruth shady a trav s de publicaciones internacionales desde hace ya varios a os
5486230 en general estamos viendo qu otras acciones debemos emprender en relaci n con estas dos personas porque el problema es de car cter tico m s que legal por decirlo de alguna manera
5486231 la suya es una cruzada de casi 15 a os en los arenales del valle de supe trabajando a veces inclusive de noche excavando o limpiando grieta a grieta y no es justo que unos ilustres aventureros le roben el fruto de sus desvelos

5486233 y es hora de que el instituto nacional de cultura tome cartas en el asunto y adem s de causas como declarar patrimonio nacional el cebiche se ocupe de temas fuertes como ste
5486234 por supuesto que este reclamo de lesa justicia no se contrapone en nada a las negociaciones del tratado de libre comercio con estados unidos porque respetos guardan respetos y porque lo cort s no quita lo valiente
5486235 quien conoce desde hace 10 a os nuestros trabajos en caral y est indignada
5486236 deploro y rechazo la actitud de los esposos y arque logos jonathan haas y winifred creamer quienes est n demostrando una completa falta de tica cient fica al presentarse como autores de investigaciones que ellos no han realizado
5486237 haberla ayudado en cierta etapa no les da derecho de apropiarse de investigaciones que todos sabemos fueron conducidas por ruth shady

5486243 i think what were looking at is a tycoon team if you will people with the resources and vision for a new energy economy
5486244 its time for the wealthiest of the country to lead in solving the carbon crisis
5486245 if they can come together on climate change and pool their intellectual resources their financial resources and their own teams of people they have managing their empires what a critical mass that would be and what a voice it would be
5486246 this is a combination of a symposium and a renewable energy street fair and multimedia presentation
5486247 its a fabulous concentration most venues dont bring all of that together
5486248 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5486249 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5486250 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5486251 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5486252 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5486253 w hile it is true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion
5486254 some folks have it easy if you use outlook you can export to the iphone
5486255 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5486256 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5486257 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5486258 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5486259 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5486260 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5486261 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5486262 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5486263 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5486264 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5486265 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5486266 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5486267 at this point he wasnt where we thought we needed to have him
5486268 you see your status as secretary of state of the usa is fast becoming as pathetic as your status as national security advisor was back in the days of 9 11 when you failed to provide any security whatsoever for your people
5486269 we do not need a stimulus plan which would be an artificial plan
5486270 we are not in a recession but we are feeling the effects of a brutal difficult crisis
5486271 the problem is that we have extremely limited room to manoeuvre because we have wasted quite a bit over the past year so maybe we should have the courage to put the fiscal package back on the table
5486272 this would asphyxiate the economy at a time when it frankly doesnt need this

5486274 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5486275 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5486276 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterise it at the time of 2001 september 11 2001
5486277 obviously its a fragile situation in pakistan because its a new civilian government for the first time in a long time in pakistan since 1999 and so our effort is to support that government strengthen it
5486278 the country was doing better economically but now the politicians wont be able to preserve the economy and things will get worse
5486279 a few days after my mothers assassination i said that democracy was the best revenge
5486280 indeed democracy is the greatest revenge and were all very proud of our country today
5486281 today we saw him reading out his own epitaph on his misrule and lack of governance
5486282 he tried to justify pretty much what he had done but i think at the end of the day this was the only option because the space for him to remain president had shrunk so much that it had become impossible to carry on
5486283 there is absolutely no logical explanation as to why we so often play below our capabilities here
5486284 that was a game thats easy to sum up there was absolutely nothing new here we just cant seem to get our game going when were here
5486285 we were simply caught napping twice we reacted much too slowly and you just cant play that way the goals we conceded were all the more frustrating because we were twice in the lead
5486286 our complete attitude for the first goal needs to be improved of course you should never let the ball bounce over your head like that but you just cant allow the ball to be given away so easily or not keep tabs on the second striker
5486287 we made it too easy for our opponents by allowing them to slot the ball in behind the defence like that
5486288 we adapted to bielefelds game played too little attention to our own game and we spent too much time discussing things with the bielefeld players rather than getting on with things ourselves when you play like that then you cant expect to win matches that are so difficult
5486289 we have only ourselves to blame for dropping the points we took the lead played quite well and then conceded a really horrible and stupid goal we then took on the challenge again took the lead again and then conceded another totally stupid goal those kind of mistakes just cant be allowed to happen whether youre in the flow of things are not whether its the first or the last game of the season

5486292 your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work who oversee the house of the lord
5486293 a broad multiclass multiracial movement is converging around obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move the nation forward with a progressive movement
5486294 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal healthcare to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
5486295 this is the way cpusa works they basically try to hitch a ride on the latest left wing vehicle and hope it gets them somewhere it doesnt surprise me in the least
5486296 i think the bigger danger is what this tells us in terms of foreign policy more than anything else because the cpusa has been very consistently opposed to anything that advances american interests
5486297 were reaching a pull the plug kind of decision this is like a last stand for webcasting
5486298 the u s is the only country in the industrialized world that does not mandate payments to recording artists and content owners for music played over the air we strongly believe this unfair exception in copyright law needs to be addressed by congress
5486299 on august 4 the tunnel had been cut through the hawera fault and advance rates were expected to significantly improve
5486300 this has happened but not on a consistent basis tunnelling rates have improved to between three and four metres on some days but rock conditions continue to be variable and quite fractured resulting in rates of one to two metres on other days
5486301 your signature contains too many lines and must be shortened you may only have up to 5 line s long text may have been implicitly wrapped causing it to be counted as multiple lines
5486302 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure
5486303 cause at the end of the day long as theres two people left on the planet
5486304 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5486305 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5486306 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5486307 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5486308 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5486309 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5486310 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5486311 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5486312 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5486313 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a 1 in 3 chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5486314 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5486315 its kind of a weird process if you stop and think about it
5486316 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5486317 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5486318 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5486319 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5486320 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5486321 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5486322 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5486323 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5486324 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5486325 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5486326 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5486327 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5486328 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5486329 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5486330 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5486331 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5486332 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5486333 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5486334 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5486335 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5486336 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5486337 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5486338 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5486339 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5486340 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5486341 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5486342 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5486343 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5486344 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5486345 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5486346 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5486347 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5486348 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5486349 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5486350 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5486351 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5486352 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5486353 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5486354 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5486355 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5486356 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5486357 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5486358 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5486359 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5486360 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5486361 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5486362 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5486363 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5486364 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5486365 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5486366 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5486367 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5486368 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5486369 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5486370 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5486371 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5486372 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5486373 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5486374 get it off the air and i really mean it
5486375 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5486376 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5486377 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5486378 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5486379 i am married to the next president of the united states
5486380 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5486381 cross blog by the oregon trail chapter of the american red cross
5486382 much anticipated local blog off begins judge says eff the olympics updated
5486383 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5486384 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world
5486385 it was sort of a momentum shift what can you do thats the ballgame
5486386 a nice easy swing on it and put it down the right side
5486387 two years have passed since hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast and there is still an extraordinary amount of work to be done
5486388 this series provides a great opportunity for sundance channel to be part of the rebuilding process while presenting inspiring and compelling programming that spotlights sustainable design and the next generation of community planners
5486389 how does your design make better the life of someone who wants to live in the house
5486390 rather than stoke the ego of the architect who wants to express their nifty idea
5486391 begin by telling us how the final design was chosen
5486392 what do i need to tell this story to try and accurately capture it
5486393 some 40 per cent of women were raped in the course of the civil war that went on for 15 years or so and this is one lady that inspired women to political office and changing their mindset and working hard to achieve it
5486394 this is one way of cutting their communication from having boyfriends and girlfriends
5486395 there are no numbers were trying to estimate from what rain gauges are saying and working out from temperatures how low it snow might have been
5486396 it was just hail its probably quite low in the hills but you cant get snow beyond a few wet flakes at that temperature nothing that would settle
5486397 but i heard the deal was on the table for a while
5486398 i appreciate the organization for moving me if they werent going to have a significant role for me in the last year of my contract at the same time im upset they werent able to find a role for me
5486399 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5486400 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5486401 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5486402 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5486403 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5486404 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5486405 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5486406 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5486407 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5486408 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5486409 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5486410 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5486411 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5486412 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5486413 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5486414 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up

5486418 were not going to comment on speculation as the secretary has said many times we have no intentions of using this authority
5486419 we believe our second quarter sales benefited from the economic impact of the fiscal stimulus tax rebates unfortunately weakness in bigger ticket projects continues particularly in markets most impacted by the housing downturn
5486420 the continuing massive industrialization in china is providing solid support to the global economy
5486421 more than doubled his loss projection to 2 6 billion and predicts that lehman will take a 4 5 billion hit from write downs
5486422 the july inflation number was high but the core inflation gain of 0 3 means the u s federal reserve has some breathing room on inflation some leeway to cut interest rates and theyre going to need it
5486423 first the u s housing market has not reached a bottom were not even close
5486424 people are watching the u s median home price currently about 206 500 when what they need to scrutinize is inventory levels were still at nine month and ten month inventories levels in most regions and a healthy market has only a three four month inventory level so dont look for any economic stimulus from the housing sector
5486425 we have lost more than 400 000 jobs since november 2007 and the losses are likely to continue for at least two more quarters q3 and q4 probably longer
5486426 even with adequate export activity its almost impossible for the u s economy to grow at or near capacity without job growth this workforce contraction will be a major factor in the feds decision to lower interest rates more
5486427 all recessions and expansions start for a reason during an expansion it frequently is a new sector like technology or a social trend such as u s veterans coming back from world war ii ready to marry begin families purchase homes and spend
5486428 thus far i dont see a catalyst for the next expansion this will also weigh on the fed which will further tip the scales in favor of lower rates
5486429 possibly in q2 2009 if were lucky but most likely not until q3 2009
5486430 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5486431 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
5486432 dr mwanawasa had been making steady progress until last night when his condition suddenly changed and required intervention
5486433 the team of doctors have reported that the intervention was successful but described the condition of his excellency the president as serious
5486434 it takes skill to diagnose this co ndition not many cardiologists are familiar with it our washington university cardiologists have the expertise and experience to both catch it early and provide appropriate treatment
5486435 the heart squeezes properly but has trouble relaxing exercise is often the trigger for sudden death because of the muscle architecture three different mechanisms contribute to the condition the muscle cells are very disorganized and haphazard the blood vessels develop very thick walls and dont relax properly reducing the amount of blood flow to all parts of the heart the third thing that happens is that heart muscle cells can die and be replaced by ineffective fibrous tissue the sudden demand of strenuous exercise can trigger ventricular tachycardia and ventrictular fibrillation causing sudden death
5486436 the battle fronts has been breached the outposts have been overrun the enemy is moving the watch towers have been abandoned destroyed or neglected

5486463 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5486464 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5486465 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5486466 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5486467 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5486468 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5486469 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

5486473 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5486474 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5486475 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5486476 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5486477 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it

5486531 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5486532 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5486533 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5486534 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5486535 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5486536 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5486537 many in the christian right tend to get their information

5486541 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5486542 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
5486543 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
5486544 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
5486545 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place

5486548 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5486549 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
5486550 it makes for a very competitive show and an excellent way to spend the last afternoon at the fair
5486551 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5486552 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5486553 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5486554 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5486555 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5486556 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5486557 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5486558 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5486559 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5486560 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5486561 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5486562 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5486563 they are like really cute stuffed teddy bears i love these bundles of joy
5486564 ive seen more people come in this morning since ive been working with the campaign
5486565 ive never had anything like this happen so i just cant hardly stand it im so excited
5486566 we tend to be told whatever we want to hear before the fact but i wanted to see it in his eyes that he really is sincere then he has my vote hands down
5486567 if i could get the chance to go up and ask to speak to him maybe shake his hand i would never forget that as long as i live
5486568 he was a really great guy and people really got to know him and really loved him its been a great thing for our staff to see the positive reaction dante had throughout the community here in roanoke
5486569 we have to move quickly if we dont want people to come down and take our technology and scientists
5486570 our capital markets have failed we come to talkfests but its about acting about investing not just innovation
5486571 the ideas are there but you dont have people prepared to take risks with millions of dollars we need more risk money
5486572 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5486573 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5486574 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
5486575 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
5486576 the direction for the public is that this is not an either or decision
5486577 for a growing number of consumers its not that theyre saying the web is here im going to turn off the tv theyre going to add to their sources that may cut into their time there are only so many hours in the day but it doesnt mean eschewing the traditional sources of news
5486578 the established news brands will continue to be the brands that attract the publics attention
5486579 i would say theres a direct correlation between how long someones been in the business and that persons willingness to adapt
5486580 this means people really want our information we just have to keep up with how they want it it means they cant be platform centric the way they used to be for people to think the audience desire for news is going away this flies right in the face of that
5486581 its a terrific time for journalists to take their career into their own hands its always been a very passive career you move up from market to market and you dont have to retrain yourself but if you take the time to retrain if you learn the new skills and its not a matter of new skills for journalism those rules stay the same you throw yourself to the front of the pack
5486582 they do have an article by erica goode and ali hameed suicide bomber kills 15 at a sunni mosque in baghdad on violence thats not covered elsewhere violence today unless the motor cyclist they describe is the bicyclist described by mcclatchy in which case the death count has risen from 6 to 15 with 29 more wounded

5486584 any of my opponents about what this country means what makes it great
5486585 a ctions demonstrations and pickets will take place in cities and towns all across canada
5486586 any of my opponents about what this country means what makes it great
5486587 is the strongest point in this and its about the debates so how about we pair it with the open the debates feature
5486588 while i appreciate the service of debbie halvorsons stepson in the armed forces my own military career of six years has allowed me to personally experience the realities of the va

5486590 wir sind gut unterwegs wir werden in diesem jahr bereits in die n he kommen insofern geht der blick hier eher nach oben als nach unten
5486591 if mccain doesnt do something stupid like name a liberal running mate he should be able to hold on obamas campaign is falling apart
5486592 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5486593 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5486594 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5486595 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5486596 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme
5486597 to solve these problems it takes an entire community of specialists working together

5486604 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
5486605 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
5486606 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
5486607 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
5486608 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
5486609 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
5486610 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
5486611 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
5486612 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
5486613 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
5486614 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
5486615 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5486616 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5486617 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5486618 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5486619 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5486620 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5486621 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5486622 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5486623 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5486624 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5486625 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5486626 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5486627 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5486628 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5486629 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5486630 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5486631 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5486632 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5486633 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5486634 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5486635 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5486636 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5486637 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5486638 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5486639 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5486640 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5486641 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5486642 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5486643 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5486644 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5486645 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5486646 you keep playin where you shouldnt be playin and you keep thinkin that youll never get burnt ha i just found me a brand new box of matches yeah and what he know you aint had time to learn
5486647 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
5486648 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
5486649 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
5486650 we always look forward to putting new state of the art capabilities into the hands of our warfighters arrowhead and longbow uta provide just that
5486651 longbow uta has proven to be very successful in simulation testing and will be in operational testing in the near term the combat proven arrowhead system has been operational since 2005 both systems outstanding integrated capabilities enhance apache lethality and crew survivability while reducing pilot workload and adding new battlefield capabilities
5486652 to some people maybe but it took two of their gpus to beat one of ours we have had dual gpu cards and its feasible that it may happen again
5486653 well have to wait for the gtx 200 series to go on a process diet to 55nm and then just perhaps well see a gx2 based on geforce gtx 260
5486654 is that product the best product you can buy for a pc
5486655 a lot of people care about power consumption two gtx 260s have lower power consumption than one 4870 x2 in the asia pacific region for example theyre sensitive about power consumption
5486656 the 777 300er will provide tam with the lowest fuel consumption and operating costs available for airplanes in this class
5486657 advanced avionics of the electronic flight bag will further improve tams operating economics and reduce emissions
5486658 some people still think of the border only in negative terms
5486659 every time we turn on the tv or pick up the newspaper we are hit by stories about illegal immigrants and the problems they create we see that all the time but i also want people to know about the positive stories
5486660 local students put on a show demonstrating how eclipses work
5486661 as part of the project they had to calculate the geometry of a simulated eclipse the shadow made by their classroom globe for instance had to be 38 times the size of the globe itself to match earths actual shadow then they had to find a local building with the right orientation and architecture for shadow casting the new church of san giovanni near trieste italy was selected for this purpose
5486662 the final result was a projected shadow so perfectly matching the real earth one that the student holding the globe seemed to be the real actor responsible of the ongoing eclipse
5486663 that sound was a radio echo caused by distant radio stations bouncing off the meteors trail
5486664 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5486665 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5486666 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5486667 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5486668 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5486669 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5486670 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5486671 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5486672 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5486673 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5486691 after toshibas hd dvd finally phased itself out and we noted that blu ray was the clear winner we saw a lot of consumers who were saying whens the right time for me to buy
5486692 were at 1080p now and thats going to continue to go up with educated consumers one of the main reasons the sony ps3 blu ray player is so interesting is that it can be updated with software so as new standards come out theyll be able to update their ps3 blu ray player with software so that its consistent with whats available on the market at the highest levels

5486694 that refugee protection for military deserters and evaders is only available where the conduct objected to amounts to a war crime a crime against peace or a crime against humanity
5486695 officially condoned military misconduct falling well short of a war crime may a support a claim to refugee protection
5486696 i believe in a canada that grants asylum to principled young americans that said no to an illegal war

5486703 three hours after the early morning blast shopkeepers residents and survivors were still pulling charred goods and debris from damaged roadside stores and sweeping ashes and wreckage into the gutter
5486704 witnesses said that the bomber a man may have been riding a motorcycle that was parked about 65 feet from a traffic light on the street

5486727 that is what our soils here in shawnee county probably absorb without wasting water running it into the ditch
5486728 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
5486729 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
5486730 there were several stories similar to that in which guards a very few i might add showed compassion to the prisoners it was rare and i never met one but some of the guys did

5486737 juventus have asked for the player but there has been no contact and branislav has chosen milan
5486738 therefore he will probably be playing for milan next season a deal will be done partly because the player is unhappy
5486739 the problem at the moment is that chelsea want four starters in his position and he is the fourth

5486745 coach pruett looks forward to the opportunity to fully litigate his case later this year and will not comment on pending litigation
5486746 some of the alleged issues in the lawsuit involve the ncaa investigation of marshall university which concluded almost seven years ago the ncaa report is available to the public and the findings concerning several of the litigants are contained in it coach pruett looks forward to a conclusion of the legal proceedings so that all the facts and all the issues can be addressed

5486767 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5486768 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
5486769 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5486770 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5486771 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5486772 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5486773 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5486774 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5486775 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5486776 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5486777 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5486778 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5486779 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5486780 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5486781 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5486782 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5486783 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5486784 what were looking at is a fire sale of properties in newer affordable neighborhoods that were bought or refinanced near the price peak with lousy mortgages
5486785 people can now afford the homes they couldnt have before

5486794 the household credit market is starting to reflect developments in the real economy
5486795 while on a year over year basis the growth numbers are still impressive the monthly figures clearly suggest that we are at the early stages of a softening trend in the pace of growth in overall household credit in canada

5486803 when a house passed version came back to the senate mccain voted against it and obama voted for it that version passed 83 to 14 and became law
5486804 over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5486805 this is an erroneous claim that we first tracked down and debunked more than three years ago when it was being repeated by democratic party chairman howard dean and sens hillary clinton and john kerry among others
5486806 on the value of any health benefits paid for by their employers which isnt the case under current law
5486807 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5486808 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
5486809 the surge has been singularly or at least very predominantly one of the main reasons for the turnaround in the war senator mccain saw that the need for it because of his judgment his experience and wisdom senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge thats a startling lack of judgment in my view
5486810 i am skeptical about the surge because its belated i wish it would have happened a year ago or two years ago or three years ago
5486811 if we prematurely withdraw from iraq at a time or a manner that leads to chaos or genocide or open regional conflict in the middle east we will have a worse situation on our hands

5486824 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5486825 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree

5486838 the individuals that were talking about are going to be on our insurance product until they either go onto medicare or pass away so increasing the quality of their lives if we make an investment today will have a payback for us down the line
5486839 of all the changes that weve made at fssa since the governor was elected in the long run this will be the most important

5486907 inzaghis return was positive and very important because we can breathe more easily and allow paloschi the chance to catch his breath slowly but surely well get everybody back
5486908 we must not rush but simply take advantage of the fact that we dont have any official matches to allow the injured players to recover in time for the start of the championship
5486909 i prepared well for this match even if im still of the pace of the game i had taken part in only one training session but i felt the wish of many people who wanted to see me on the pitch im happy as i should have played only half an hour instead i played forty five minutes

5486927 calling for a complete boycott of the olympic games is not a good solution

5486929 all those who think olympics should go hand in hand with respect for human rights are also urged to insist that the international olympic committee take a stand
5486930 the ioc is clearly not a political tool but it is the guarantor of the olympic spirit and it cannot continue to display such passivity in the face of these flagrant violations of a peoples basic rights going further down this road would end up signifying a degree of complicity with the chinese government

5486979 i have serious sadness over two things in the congress
5486980 i know its the two biggest issues that youre concerned about but 107 days until the election maybe its 106 by now and things will be better
5486981 this will not happen without the election of barack obama as president of the united states

5487031 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5487032 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5487033 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5487034 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5487035 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5487036 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5487037 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5487038 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5487039 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5487040 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5487041 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5487042 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5487043 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5487044 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5487045 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5487046 phonetic spellings of ziros statements to padme would read like this ah know and a senatah in this nay buh hood and yuh tried to call fuh help senatah i honestly havent decided yet if this character is so wrong that it actually goes round the bend and becomes kind of perversely awesome in its totally batshit insane political incorrectness but im guessing most everybody will hate the drag queen hutt and i wouldnt be a bit surprised if glaad issued some sort of statement

5487051 the gap in revenue per employee between google and sap and salesforce com for instance indicates that google would more likely be more interested in what ebay does or in monetizing youtube than in zoho or salesforce coms barely profitable business companies invest in what generates the best return on investment
5487052 googles margins are a once in a lifetime occurrence and google will move in that high growth direction thats why microsoft is so desperate about search it has a higher growth rate we are more worried about microsoft than google microsoft will address the internet but pulling down office margins is a challenge for them no company peacefully accepts a lowering of margins
5487053 our intention is to help erode microsofts profit margin coming in from below
5487054 if salesforce is a proxy it would be difficult for google to justify the investment
5487055 one of the privileges we enjoy as a private company is to not disclose revenue profit numbers which lets us do the kind of analysis on competitors they cant do on us

5487066 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5487067 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5487068 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5487069 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5487070 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5487071 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5487072 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5487073 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5487074 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5487075 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible

5487077 how can it be art if it doesnt look like it was formed from leftover construction materials
5487078 this j p patches statue doesnt seem controversial at all

5487083 si bien por el momento nadie se atreve a hablar de cifras concretas las empresas desarrolladoras y las inmobiliarias reconocen que son cada vez menos los inversores extranjeros interesados en adquirir propiedades en buenos aires
5487084 para las empresas del sector reconocer que hay menos extranjeros no resulta nada f cil ya que en cierta medida implica atentar contra su negocio sin embargo con preocupaci n los empresarios admiten que cada vez son menos los extranjeros que se acercan a sus oficinas dispuestos a pagar 300 000 d lares por un departamento en puerto madero o medio mill n de d lares por un piso en recoleta lo que sin dudas contribuy a que en la primera mitad del a o se registrara una ca da del 27 por ciento en el total de permisos de construcci n autorizados en la capital federal

5487111 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
5487112 i think the worst of this housing problem may well be over
5487113 a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity
5487114 the fed financed takeover of investment bank bear stearns also made government backing of fannie and freddie debt
5487115 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses government sponsored enterprises
5487116 the problem is not quants per se but funds of funds and short term performance focus
5487117 capital is being allocated by nearly incompetent self righteous folks and thats where the problem is hiring of competent managers for our mutual and pension funds should be given a priority
5487118 quantitative portfolio construction based on sound macro value ideas and risk management is here to stay kill short term profit focus kill calendar performance boogies and quants will again become liquidity providers smoothing instead of exaggerating volatility kill the system that allowed quants to get so big dont shoot the quants they are the messengers of a broken system of values we just dont like the message they brought to us

5487141 lets be clear this is not about funding disclosure we are very transparent and willingly share our sources of funding to anyone who asks up to the minute as we have throughout our three decades as a 501c3

5487151 well without being rude we thought it was rather suggestive
5487152 i think it is inappropriate because you just never know who could be out and about and see that and just think it was a bit too enticing for a young child to be wearing
5487153 i would like to see all the products removed from the shelves
5487154 unfortunately an oversight was made and the text on the underwear was used out context
5487155 this product will not be part of any forthcoming collections and the remaining product has been removed from shelves

5487488 after looking at the tape we made too many mental mistakes offensively and defensively both

5487511 i have to run my race no matter who its against
5487512 there are parts of the state where i am not well known
5487513 i think mccain really did something extraordinary when the way he answered that question so he put it out there he acknowledged it and he sort of inoculated himself against it
5487514 mccain has acknowledged that he was not faithful in his first marriage but not necessarily before a national television audience
5487515 i think mccain really did something extraordinary when the way he answered that question he addressed an issue that the campaign has been having a hard time figuring out how to deal with theyve wanted to confront it its out there on the internet its something that democrats are trying to use against mccain so he put it out there he acknowledged it and he sort of inoculated himself against it i think thats really going to help him
5487516 mccain has acknowledged that he was not faithful in his first marriage but not necessarily before a national television audience
5487517 what i trace this to is a certain selfishness on my part i was so obsessed with me and you know the reasons that i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people
5487518 obamas answer you know that was not new information for a 47 year old man to claim that his worst moral failing happened when he was a teenager i dont know its a little disingenuous
5487519 you had an affair your first marriage the sitting president is been impeached for his conduct with monica lewinsky should a politicians private acts be part of public discourse
5487520 let me say that i am responsible for the break up of my first marriage i will not discuss or talk about that any more than that if someone wants to criticize me for that thats fine i believe that the standards of morality of conduct will be determined not by the politician themselves but by the media and the american people i will leave that judgment to them
5487521 is there anything out there that you want to talk about rather than wait until this campaign goes on and on and on thats going to cause surprises in the press once again will focus on scandals as opposed to policy issues
5487522 i certainly hope not i have made it clear that i am responsible for the break up of my first marriage but ive also made it clear that im not going to discuss that
5487523 you admitted to infidelity in your first marriage are you worried about the scrutiny that you and your family will have to undergo in this campaign
5487524 i have said that im responsible for the breakup of my first marriage i have then and now refused to discuss that further
5487525 w hen he mccain came back from the war to a wife who had waited for him not only that but had been badly injured in an auto accident while waiting he divorced her for the daughter of a wealthy arizona beer distributor
5487526 i say im responsible for the breakup of my first marriage and i will always bear that responsibility and i am not proud of it
5487527 not show the same determination to rebuild my personal life
5487528 my marriage to carol mccain was falling apart sound marriages can be hard to recover after great time and distance have separated a husband and wife we are different people when we reunite but my marriages collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more than it was to vietnam and i cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war the blame was entirely mine
5487529 the media and the american people have the right to make a judgment about him but the governor is entitled to privacy
5487530 ive done things in my life im not proud of im a believer in redemption and my life has been less than exemplary in many respects
5487531 im responsible for the breakup of my first marriage but i dont want to go into the details

5487537 it really kind of went on for a few days and just kind of got progressively worse
5487538 even up til right before they came in and told me i had appendicitis that was the last thing on my mind it kind of really snuck up on me and really wasnt the telltale signs of appendicitis
5487539 any time you are out nothing can replace the pounding and change of direction and shedding blocks like just good old fashioned getting in there and getting the work done
5487540 im really hoping to build that up as we progress through these last weeks of camp

5487566 an ambassador who starts prejudiced against the country to which he is accredited might just as well pack up and go home
5487567 then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him
5487568 if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him
5487569 however i know the minds of the president the secretary and the department pretty well and that should help to keep a straight course

5487573 no the baby is not coming for a while yet
5487574 and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living
5487575 this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it
5487576 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil

5487590 are appalled by the conduct of the ird towards our industry
5487591 it is out of control we expect mr oconnors support on this matter taxpayers must be able to rely on signed written agreements with the ird
5487592 we are excited about the traction envysion video has gained within the restaurant retail and hotel segments
5487593 o maikon rompeu o ligamento cruzado posterior e o anterior rompeu tamb m o ligamento colateral medial ele vai ficar um ano fora
5487594 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5487595 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
5487596 cuando hay un estado de derecho de buena fe como el estado de colombia no hay sitio en el mundo que le valga de escondite a los terroristas
5487597 se encuentra actualmente hospitalizada en nicaragua porque hay operarla de otro problema que ten a una enfermedad que le ha afectado desde hace unos cuantos a os
5487598 no salga inventando otra cosa alrededor de este hecho asilo que el gobierno acogi por razones eminentemente humanitarias
5487599 he said he had already begun to organize and he would not be able to do that
5487600 you had to know him as a person he was very aggressive focused consider his upbringing and what he had to overcome i think his attitude was different than a black man raised in black america
5487601 he wondered if we should knock everybody off the ballot how would that look
5487602 theres a legitimate argument to be made that you shouldnt create barriers to people getting on the ballot
5487603 to my mind we were just abiding by the rules that had been set up
5487604 i gave some thought to should people be on the ballot even if they didnt meet the requirements
5487605 my conclusion was that if you couldnt run a successful petition drive then that raised questions in terms of how effective a representative you were going to be
5487606 i think they ended up with a very good state senator
5487607 knock out your opposition challenge their petitions destroy your enemy right it is how barack obama destroyed his enemies back in 1996 that conflicts with his message today he may have gotten his start registering thousands of voters but in that first race he made sure voters had just one choice
5487608 that cnn talk to a state representative who supports obama because according to an obama spokesman she would be objective
5487609 one of the first things you do whenever youre in the middle of a primary race especially in primaries in chicago because if you dont have signatures to get on the ballot you save yourself a lot of time and effort from having to raise money and have a full blown campaign effort against an incumbent
5487610 its not the tactics of lets all people come together and put your best ideas forward and the best ideas win
5487611 thats the spin thats in the kool aid you can have some any flavor but the real deal was get rid of alice palmer
5487612 there are those who think that registering people to vote and getting them involved in politics and then using this tactic in terms of denying alice palmer the right to compete that these things are inconsistent and guess what they are they are inconsistent but thats the politics he plays
5487613 if you can win you should win and get to work doing the peoples business
5487614 it is flown upside down only as a distress signal
5487615 there are over 500 ski resorts across japan from the northern island of hokkaido to the southern main island of kyushu varying in size from large resorts with dozens of runs to small one lift slopes
5487616 no compromise with the main purpose no peace till victory no pact with unrepentant wrong
5487617 what would i have done i dont know what i know is that from my vantage point the case was not made
5487618 i didnt have the information that was available to senators
5487619 im always careful to say that i was not in the senate so perhaps the reason i thought the war was such a bad idea was that i didnt have the benefit of u s intelligence
5487620 and for those that did it might have led to a different set of choices

5487625 he was frosty at first he felt betrayed when she dumped him for his friend lance but after a while he caved in and has been sweet to her

5487648 juventus have asked for the player but there has been no contact and branislav has chosen milan
5487649 therefore he will probably be playing for milan next season a deal will be done partly because the player is unhappy

5487688 i am delighted to present you with a couple of very impressive results from last weeks total solar eclipse and which i was fortunate to view and photograph from novosibirsk siberia
5487689 as luck would have it the skies cleared about two hours before first contact and remained perfectly clear until 60 minutes after the eclipse and at which point the dense clouds arrived once again for those who did head south there were major problems with chinese officials and who confiscated a lot of equipment and levied fines the weather also degraded during the eclipse

5487694 why draw attention to something that will disappear with the next news cycle
5487695 everything is moving at warp speed the lesson of the last 20 years is to respond immediately and aggressively and across a broad front
5487696 the unending news cycle the explosion of the blogosphere and the freelance work of independent groups like the swift boat veterans of 2004 whose campaign severely undercut john kerrys bid for president has made every campaign entourage a kind of road crew cum paramedic team
5487697 when the swift boat ads hit us it was obviously a serious matter aimed straight at johns character
5487698 so howard dean called the republican party the white party strategically speaking this insult he has said it before in other situations so it is neither a gaffe nor an accident is beyond tone deaf and is sheer political idiocy this moronic mouthing off plays into every standard stereotype of an arrogant stevensonian elitist and adds fuel to the race baiting fires already burning through the democrats support this year thanks to obamas smear and run campaign this is a different claim than if dean had gone after the republicans as the racist party or even the anti minorty party which is what he probably thought he was doing by making an insult out of a biological fact instead of a pattern of behavior dean has declared that he and thus democrats as such being as how he is the dnc chair think that white is a suspect and dangerous category of person he did a crude inversion of racist claims about non whites and it says a hell of a lot about the moral and ethical midden between deans ears

5487706 for me the biggest issue is getting the book to the reader and how thats done im happy to leave to the marketing people unless they overstep the mark in this case i feel they really have overstepped the mark
5487707 if they had asked writers and children and parents they would have realised a lot of people are outraged at the prescriptive nature of this scheme
5487708 theres no such thing as an average seven year old they could be four or 10 or like me 65 its just nonsense
5487709 if you say a book is for a seven year old the nine year old is going to be trying to cover it up at the back of the class
5487710 there are so many more important issues they should concentrate on
5487711 the best way to get children to read is to write good books in the first place make sure theyre beautifully illustrated then have libraries open and teachers who love books and parents who love books thats how we improve reading among children
5487712 the interesting thing about childrens books is that its not the readers who are buying them it is parents and grandparents and libraries and schools
5487713 i think thats what the publishers were trying to address as a reader you drop a book if you dont like it so children will self censor but its knowing what to buy them in the first place
5487714 im sorry but i cant sit on that hard wooden seat
5487715 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
5487716 longer term we are still bullish on gold one of the things that have happened is that gold broke its support its 8 month support at 850 so the possibility of pulling back to the uptrend at around 760 still exists we have to remember that its been 2 years since we had the major corrective pullback which was also about 25 percent in 2006 so this is all part of the normal consolidation corrective cyclical bear market that occurs within an ongoing bull market environment
5487717 first of all the regulators issuers and participants need to be commended for getting the ball rolling to restoring liquidity to this market my concern is that the focus
5487718 the fact that 90 years after the pandemic b cells are still floating around in the blood of these people just changes our notion of immunologic memory

5487721 the cuts were in response to the general economic weakness and pressures in the industry
5487722 we ought not to interfere with the decision that the plan is fair and reasonable in all the circumstance
5487723 it is the policy of the united states to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective national missile defence system capable of defending the territory of the united states against limited ballistic missile attack whether accidental unauthorized or deliberate with funding subject to the annual authorization of appropriations and the annual appropriation of funds for national missile defence

5487754 the list of credentialed blogs include radical sites like the daily kos worse are blogs that feature anti catholic and obscene material the two most offensive are bitch ph d and towleroad
5487755 both of these blogs should be cut immediately from the list of credentialed sites neither functions as a responsible media outlet and both offend catholics as well as others to allow them access to the democratic national convention sends a message to catholics they will not forget we look for leah daughtry ceo of the convention to nix them asap

5487757 because there is no ceiling for trevard he can be as good as he wants to be we get him on daily about working harder hes got so much talent that its my job as a coach to make sure he gets the most out of it and im that way because things come so easy for him
5487758 i guess sometimes i can get a little lazy in practice
5487759 i thought he was going to run an inside route and he just took off
5487760 i tried to catch him but i couldnt i guess i wasnt really ready for it
5487761 we preached to him that florida lives by the big play and those guys are just going to run down the field
5487762 he started late in his backpedal and the guy ran right by him you hate like heck for that happen but hopefully you learn from it maybe from now on when they tell you the stove is hot they wont stick their hand on it to see if youre telling the truth or not
5487763 hes got enough speed that even when hes out of position he can come back and make plays
5487764 now were continuing to work with him on being in perfect position so he can make even more plays
5487765 the sec is such a competitive league such a fight that if you can play with experienced guys who have been through the battles thats what youre looking for
5487766 were just trying to get him to totally understand the scheme so he can play fast

5487769 texans have long held that it is a fundamental right of every law abiding citizen to keep and bear arms affirmation from our countrys highest court should unquestionably cement this right for future generations of texans and americans
5487770 the last time i checked putting a sign up that says dont bring your weapons in here someone who has ill intent on their mind they could care less
5487771 i think it makes sense for texans to be able to protect themselves from deranged individuals whether theyre in church or whether on a college campus or wherever

5487775 we need more playing time to come together as a team
5487776 you have to play some to tackle better and so well play more this week with our starters the same offensively to get timing especially in the passing game
5487777 after looking at the tape we made too many mental mistakes offensively and defensively both
5487778 its a gradual process and we have to embrace the process win when its time to win
5487779 but we have got to come together definitely by the end of the preseason thats our biggest goal and be hitting on all cylinders at the beginning of the regular season
5487780 even in preseason you get back in a routine and back to familiar things now well be more settled

5487847 which i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class but thats reflected in his policies where you know for people making more than 2 5 million hes giving folks a 500 000 tax break and so this is a fundamental difference in this election what ive said is were gonna give 95 of working families a tax break but its gonna be ordinary folks

5487875 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5487876 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5487877 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5487878 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5487879 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5487880 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5487881 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall

5487935 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5487936 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5487937 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5487938 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5487939 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5487940 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5487941 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5487942 they confiscated all of the bibles 315 in total and were told that only one per person was allowed

5487949 eddie campbells books are becoming with each passing year more stunning

5487951 its a fine eddie campbell book in the style that no one else could replicate and a joy to read
5487952 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5487953 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5487954 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5487955 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5487956 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5487957 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5487958 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one
5487959 it means that the third ddg 1000 ship is very likely to go forward and yet theres also the potential of building more ddg 51s

5487970 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
5487971 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time
5487972 it feels great my body does not feel the same on the ground it will be great to get home
5487973 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5487974 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5487975 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about

5487986 a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5487987 we have come from a different background and this is a mandate the people have given to us to lead the country to peace
5487988 we would probably wait and see what ukraines response is what the eu u s and natos response is then we would try to draw up a new balance sheet which takes these things into consideration
5487989 the economy has a negative side to the positive story the economy has been growing so rapidly with high credit growth there were questions about overheating and excessive foreign currency bank borrowing
5487990 the vice president is not an independent voice but merely echoes the position of the president as long as they both shall live
5487991 conservatives should have no fear of a vice president tom ridge
5487992 id be just like president mccain you know for life
5487993 wouldnt you be nervous looking over your shoulder at a guy whos a heartbeat away from having your job and you know that hes not opposed to stopping more than a million tiny hearts from beating each year
5487994 can use overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
5487995 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5487996 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5487997 i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them
5487998 but im happy to say that the episodes that they sent me to look at were really really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work that ive actually been involved in
5487999 its great for the chinese team to lead the medal tally since the beginning of the games
5488000 we enjoy the games by watching tv broadcasts in the cafe
5488001 i go to cafes after 10 oclock at night to watch the rebroadcast of the games
5488002 i stay in the cafe the whole day on fridays
5488003 its the best way for me to relax after a day of work and i enjoy the games very much

5488006 tresuary no title i think if it was in japan
5488007 juventus have asked for the player but there has been no contact and branislav has chosen milan
5488008 therefore he will probably be playing for milan next season a deal will be done partly because the player is unhappy
5488009 the problem at the moment is that chelsea want four starters in his position and he is the fourth
5488010 higher mortgage rates and falling property prices will cause investors to reconsider their exposure to residential property and many will choose a more diversified approach

5488014 i put 116 dollars in it today and that was at this price my husband says we probably saved about 8 dollars
5488015 drivers say they welcome any relief at the pump but they dont expect these prices to last
5488016 i think its going to go back up to four dollars its got to in order for people to take the alternative technology serious and it did go back up 3 cents at the same bp station on amnicola
5488017 this is just fabulous to be able to fill up my car for like half the price i did there i think its going to get even lower and hope it stays this for a while
5488018 itll go down one day then up a few cents the next day its too soon to tell whats going to happen
5488019 everybody is still going 70 75 miles per hour apparently it would have had to have gone higher before people actually slowed down

5488025 i like how the teacher joked with us and made it seem like it was going to be something else but once we got talking it seemed a lot more interesting
5488026 theres so much opportunity theres so many great programs in this community we really want to learn more about them and look at the best partnerships moving forward

5488037 bernie always said that he walked alone i dont think that he was alone i think he was walking with jesus ill see you soon bernie
5488038 later that morning we received information from wilmington that vehicle was related to investigation they were looking into
5488039 excused from such performance from and after july 4 2008 pursuant to california labor code sec 2855 a
5488040 may not be enforced against the employee beyond seven years from the commencement of service under it
5488041 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5488042 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5488043 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5488044 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5488045 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5488046 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5488047 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5488048 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known
5488049 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5488050 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5488051 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5488052 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5488053 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5488054 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5488055 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5488056 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5488057 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5488058 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5488059 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5488060 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5488061 next time you better go or youll have to hit the road jack
5488062 ok do you have any idea what it tastes like
5488063 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest
5488064 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china
5488065 and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5488066 he had to swallow himself whole and he went there the chinese are like that ok fine you dont like us were not buying french food
5488067 as a canadian i deplore the fact weve lost our position in the world
5488068 ask any businessman who goes to china and theyll tell you that
5488069 i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them
5488070 but im happy to say that the episodes that they sent me to look at were really really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work that ive actually been involved in
5488071 with the recent correction in the stock market and a slowing housing market canadians are seeing their net wealth position shrinking
5488072 a clear indication that the canadian economy is softening quickly
5488073 this environment poses a major challenge to markets and policy makers in north america
5488074 the household credit market is starting to reflect developments in the real economy
5488075 while on a year over year basis the growth numbers are still impressive the monthly figures clearly suggest that we are at the early stages of a softening trend in the pace of growth in overall household credit in canada
5488076 i dont think well be going off the cliff there may be a certain amount of reality to be faced in some areas because of the larger inventory and the slackening demand but i dont believe that were going to see anything like the united states has seen in recent times
5488077 the overriding criteria for the appointment of a supreme court justice will be merit
5488078 in determining merit certainly an asset for any individual to sit on that court is the ability to converse and understand both official languages
5488079 we do consult with the chief justices among others in every province and we have been very responsive when its been indicated to us that that would be an important characteristic of appointing a superior court judge
5488080 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5488081 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5488082 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5488083 i am sure that such a well conducted effective peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5488084 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider

5488088 its very easy to cause a lot of trouble using three guys and a laptop
5488089 the question that remains is was it planned or was it something that happened by coincidence or was it a bit of both
5488090 what makes this different is that the targets are no longer strictly military communications infrastructure and were now talking about destroying civilian internet sites
5488091 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5488092 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5488093 i find the ethical considerations of supervised injections to be profoundly disturbing
5488094 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5488095 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5488096 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5488097 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5488098 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5488099 we have to do more to reach out to our own sons and daughters who are overdosing in the downtown eastside
5488100 they need our compassion and they need our intervention not help simply to shoot up
5488101 we know that if people have a safe place that they can talk to people that they eventually will come off drugs they eventually will get help and that they dont die

5488105 is that a cool thing to say in this day and age that you love your country and that youre fighting for the red white and blue it seems sort of like a day gone by
5488106 these mid and small cap selections can be an attractive alternative to those from the tsx 60
5488107 the reason investors need to pay attention to the dividend growers outside the tsx 60 is that they have uniformly outperformed their large cap peers within the 60
5488108 we are an independent country we are talking about the interests of our country we have to make investments with regard to turkeys supply security
5488109 in the talks everything including investments is being conducted according to a set timetable
5488110 we will hold important talks with iran within one month we hope that the work which we launched before will produce a result during this period
5488111 we are going to iran within 15 days probably our foreign minister ali babacan will be at our side lets not say we are going to sign an accord but we will have important talks
5488112 we would have liked to move ahead with the project but we saw that the preparations are not yet sufficient and we instructed our energy ministries to carry out a more detailed work
5488113 we would regret it if some would think that we do things because someone tells us to do so

5488147 if they screw up in a building and they deliberately do things that are wrong in the building just to pocket money and people die because of it then people should be held accountable

5488173 this weekend exceeded our expectations and the film is in a position to do terrific business the great reviews we received across the country calling it a funny sexy beautiful end of summer film helped us
5488174 its not match point which was quite dark or cassandras dream which we released earlier this year
5488175 vicky is much funnier and lighter and we think were capitalizing on that
5488176 we think were really positioned to run for a while here
5488177 we feel like we opened pretty wide the key for us is to see what the drop off is this weekend and then make plans accordingly we would expect to increase markets and runs on labor day weekend
5488178 everyone we showed to thought it was great we originally had a more cautious or limited release on labor day weekend and have it be more of a september film but the more we started showing it the more we felt it was more apporpriate for a wider release in late summer
5488179 we are happy with the opening weekend numbers for a girl cut in two in a pretty crowded marketplace
5488180 we feel confident there is still a great appetite for french language films

5488191 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5488192 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5488193 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5488194 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the un security council making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5488195 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5488255 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5488256 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5488257 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5488258 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5488259 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5488260 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5488261 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order

5488266 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity

5488292 eddie brock muito importante para a mitologia do homem aranha
5488293 ele tem toda uma hist ria de dio contra peter e contra o aranha al m disso um dos principais personagens na cronologia do her i desde os anos 80 com ou sem simbionte
5488294 n o vou revelar se ele ou n o um simbionte s posso adiantar que na primeira vez em que o vir peter vai achar que um simbionte o que n o quer dizer que ele esteja certo
5488295 nas primeiras reuni es sobre estas hist rias nos refer amos a ele como
5488296 e eles n o estar o s perseguindo o homem aranha eles querem peg lo
5488297 esta vai ser a primeira luta pra valer entre o mercen rio e o aranha
5488298 eles chegaram a se encontrar anteriormente mas por poucas p ginas nem sei se lutaram
5488299 depois que a iniciativa entrou na ativa os her is registrados estavam t o mobilizados que havia poucos crimes com os quais eles n o pudessem lidar
5488300 esse o mundo que aparece no come o de brand new day um mundo que n o precisava do homem aranha um mundo em que as escolhas que peter fez no passado reduziram consideravelmente as escolhas sobre o que ele pode fazer de sua vida agora

5488303 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
5488304 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that
5488305 but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace
5488306 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5488307 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5488308 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend

5488311 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5488312 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5488313 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5488314 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5488315 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5488316 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5488317 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5488318 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5488319 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5488320 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5488321 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5488322 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5488323 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5488324 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go

5488342 we are amazed by the wonderful response we have received to project forgiveness
5488343 the fact that people can send in postcards or entries anonymously makes it easy to begin to address issues of regret we are again receiving sincere and heartfelt apologies and hope their words will inspire others to contemplate interpersonal relationships the jewish new year isnt only about praying to g d for forgiveness for our sins before one can attain forgiveness from the almighty for turning on a light on shabbat or using his name in vain one must first mend relationships with family and friends this aspect of the high holy days is so important that one must attempt to ask for forgiveness three times before he is released from his obligation to apologize

5488386 beijing has achieved and surpassed the targets it set for itself on environmental protection
5488387 beijing has made an enormous amount of permanent improvement in environmental protection including the construction of 150 kilometres of public transportation infrastructure and the olympic forest park a large park in the heart of the city
5488388 there is still significant room for improvement in the areas of particle matter water resources management and water quality and air quality is always going to be the most significant challenge
5488389 the final question is will beijing continue to invest in its public transportation infrastructure i think that will be a big test for the long term impact of the games

5488439 coming around again could have been a hit for anybody except we ended up playing it a bit too fast and adding lots of over the top twangy surf guitar and beeping farfisa organ that kind of detracts from its easy listening qualities
5488440 so even though coming around again is released 9 months after chasing rainbows it is not an indication of how the next album is gonna sound like its just a damn great song
5488441 i feel high is really different if it wasn t for the lyrical theme sex drugs rock n roll it would have fit well on the chasing rainbows album where i deliberately wanted to go a bit deeper with my subject matter acoustic guitar bass tambourine and a hauntingly hypnotic farfisa organ we actually recorded this as a band but felt it worked better sounding a bit folky and psychedelic the intro was later pasted on consisting of backwards drums and distant fuzz guitar

5488465 i made no offer to mr estcourt i have had no contact with him whatsoever in connection with such an appointment
5488466 i have been interviewed by police in recent weeks and not once did they inform me i was the subject of any investigation
5488467 nor have i ever been informed about any specific allegations made against me by mr burch
5488468 in flagging moves late last week to give tasmania a truly independent police service the premier mr bartlett made the case himself for an independent probe into these grave allegations
5488469 they thought i was joking eventually i had to show them my new bank cards to get them to believe me they kept asking why people seemed vaguely disapproving as if we were breaking a sacred rule
5488470 our concern is that were willing to work with them to save tax dollars but tax dollars is not necessarily whats right for service we have to make sure we have the proper equipment personnel training
5488471 frankly fayetteville and manlius work so well together on a daily basis that it made sense to sit there and say if its working so well in this informal agreement why not formalize and maybe take it to the next step and thats what this process is but we still have a lot of work to do
5488472 one of our goals this year when we set our new budget was to look at areas that we can save in the village in our budget process we have done it at the clerks office at the dpw the fire department was the next logical step
5488473 its real important that we keep an eye on both our career staff and volunteers and figure out a way to blend the two and keep our volunteers vibrant and career staff together and working as well as they have been

5488476 can use overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
5488477 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5488478 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5488479 pogue and mossberg have already seen it and they think its the bomb
5488480 part of that is because i started to sing just 2 years ago and it came out that way
5488481 i understand it in a conversation but im a little embarassed that i cant speak it
5488482 and so i said i want to play the drums i saw that it was cool to play the drums
5488483 i feel good like i am where i should be
5488484 i have a few fans but i have a lot of support everyday there are more people
5488485 its sad that people can be held captive for 6 years
5488486 its everything to me its what makes me who i am as a person
5488487 that is a basis of my faith to be humble
5488488 how can it be art if it doesnt look like it was formed from leftover construction materials
5488489 this j p patches statue doesnt seem controversial at all
5488490 if it doesnt offend people with outdated traditional moral values then whats the point
5488491 i just cant believe we are honoring a character that stands for such blatantly anti fremont values like washing your hands face neck and ears or sharing your toys

5488508 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week
5488509 i read sir alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
5488510 doing the daily show for the past six weeks has really been one of the most exciting times in my life
5488511 it has given me the chance to be myself while living out my dream and connecting with my fans on a whole new level

5488514 this is a case that has received a lot of negative publicity and the general population that could be on the jury is already contaminated
5488515 im preaching to me as much as im preaching to you i know god is here no matter the circumstance
5488516 i come here tonight with a cure for a broken heart as well
5488517 im preaching to me as much as im preaching to you tonight
5488518 some people have asked me whether i am angry at god because my son is no longer here
5488519 but how can i be mad at a god who holds my son safely in his arms tonight its hard knowing that i wont see my son again on earth but i have the assurance that christopher is in heaven because he put his faith in jesus i havent lost my son because i know where he is and someday i will join him
5488520 heaven is not the default destination when you die you have to choose it jesus christ paid your way to heaven when he died on the cross for you but you must make your own choice to follow him
5488521 woe to those who enact evil statutes and to those who constantly record unjust decisions 2 so as to deprive the needy of justice and rob the poor of my people of their rights so that widows may be their spoil and that they may plunder the orphans 3 now what will you do in the day of punishment and in the devastation which will come from afar to whom will you flee for help and where will you leave your wealth

5488544 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5488545 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5488546 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5488547 of course cloaking captures everybodys attention but these papers arent just about cloaking
5488548 the studies are about the ability to engineer these material properties that never exist in nature with that ability one can do many things and cloaking is only one of them
5488549 its like when you try to cross a river and keep your feet dry you may jump across stones and cross without getting your feet wet
5488550 thats exactly what we did we tried to engineer these materials such that energy passing through is hopping through other materials and not the metal because in the metal you have a big energy loss
5488551 even in their current state or maybe a few generations later they could have applications in optical communications or imaging
5488552 you want to cloak things that are big otherwise they are already essentially invisible because they are microscopic
5488553 to cloak a person you need metamaterial thats on that length scale and thats much much bigger than what these papers have demonstrated
5488554 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5488555 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5488556 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5488557 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5488558 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5488559 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5488560 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5488561 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5488562 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5488563 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence

5488568 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility

5488571 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5488572 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5488573 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5488574 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s outlook key
5488575 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5488576 the u s is obviously still a very important region for these companies
5488577 people know its weak but does it get worse i would argue even the u s business has not been as bad as people have said

5488580 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaida and extremist groups
5488581 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges that they face
5488582 the decision by president musharraf will now open up the possibility for the new government to act more decisively on issues facing it and i think that will allow the united states to work in closer cooperation in the weeks ahead
5488583 the fight against these kinds of groups that are interested in attacking the united states or our allies or friends around the world is a fight that was much larger than musharraf as an individual and required institutional changes within the pakistani army intelligence and also at the civilian level among the civilian political leaders to address the rising tide of extremism throughout the country
5488584 with musharraf out of the way it actually provides an opportunity now for the united states to distance itself to some extent so that if the military and the civilian government can agree on a policy which i think inevitably is going to have to be a more aggressive approach to the extremists it will not be seen as american policy
5488585 arizona hospitals are at a huge advantage to be represented by azhha an organization that is cognizant of their needs and is actively searchingfor cutting edge solutions to assist them

5488590 the impeachment threat is a very necessary step to restoring the constitution and getting civilian control over the military
5488591 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaida and extremist groups
5488592 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5488593 theres no stable settlement these two guys sharif and zardari will now start slugging it out
5488594 i hope all of pakistans friends will now seize the opportunity created by musharrafs exit to focus on the urgent issues of today confronting the threat of extremist violence dealing with food and energy shortages and helping the pakistani people build a stable secure democratic future
5488595 the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally
5488596 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions

5488651 the cow she thinks shes a dog so shes interested in everything
5488652 we really cant say whether she chased him away or wanted him to play
5488653 lets see how you like it when we do it
5488654 history and the quality of players on show suggests that both sides are going to go on the attack right from the kick off
5488655 both the argentinians and ourselves have players with the same creative characteristics and that makes me think well see an exciting match
5488656 i dont think you can compare that game with this one every tournament is different and the olympic games even more so because of the special atmosphere they have its hard to predict but i really wouldnt use that game as a benchmark
5488657 batista is doing a terrific job with this team and thats been plain to see throughout the tournament perhaps the only difference between us is that im also in charge of the full team
5488658 the reason for it all is very simple they are the two south american teams with the most world titles and theyre almost always there in the final rounds of the biggest tournaments its a historical rivalry and every time they meet theres always a lot of expectation this times no exception of course
5488659 the team knows the difficulties weve had just to get this far and theyre pleased to have reached this stage of the competition they are confident secure in themselves and they know what they want thats vital when the time comes to battle it out for the right result
5488660 the field of orthopedic implants is poised to transition towardspersonalized implants since off the shelf implant designs cannotaccommodate all of the anatomic variations present across patients

5488662 this latest attack on ultcw once again speaks to the unfortunateextremes uhw w leadership will take to fuel their war waged on seiu itsprograms and those who support its vision in order to redirect publicfocus off of their own internal issues surrounding the investigation andlegal action taken by its own members for the improper transfer of 3million of dues money into an outside fund

5488666 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5488667 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5488668 tomorrow morning youll be going to a meeting of tajis qada a qada is a kind of county that means youll be able to see how we cooperate with the locals thats what you wanted to see wasnt it

5488673 would you like us to pave the road for a kilometer or so
5488674 arent you afraid then that sooner or later your money will end up with the insurgents
5488675 formerly known as concerned local citizens the boys and men who used to be paid by the insurgents and who fought for them are now sons of iraq they help the iraqi police the iraqi army or they guard checkpoints they get paid for it weve given them an alternative and they were also tired of fighting
5488676 first al qaida came in and said we will give you 200 to place an ied then the americans came in and said we will give you 200
5488677 behind the insurgency there isnt so much ideology whats behind it is a whole lot of economy

5488681 you run the wind when you can just like we run the hydro when we can because the incremental cost is very low
5488682 but then you have to be concerned about the reliability of the system and that youre protected and that you can meet loads when you lose your lower cost and volatile resource

5488690 i think they are traveling up and down in packs
5488691 weve seen as many as four or five at a time
5488692 we asked if they would come and get them the animal control and they said no and they said we cant shoot them because we are inside city limits
5488693 the bir and boc commissioners as well as their respective officers should be vigorous in fully implementing the law instead of looking for loopholes to circumvent the penalties provided therein
5488694 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5488695 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5488696 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5488697 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5488698 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children

5488709 wait circus people dont they live in caravans and work in a tent
5488710 i appreciate you being candid with me about your concerns im going to go on trying to do a good job but it sounds like we should be realistic about the possibility this wont work out i wonder if we can make arrangements now to plan for a transition that will be as smooth as possible for both of us would you be willing to work with me while i conduct a job search that will help me and it will give you time to search for a replacement and have a smooth transition and i can be as involved as youd like in bringing the new person up to speed
5488711 im saying here i am an individual who had one point of view and now i have a different one
5488712 being away from the drug free america foundation allowed me an opportunity to take a fresh look at the issue
5488713 his anti drug philosophies along with his experience will be a great fit
5488714 when i joined that group the question of medical marijuana was not entirely settled
5488715 i was looking at it from the issue of does it have a medical benefit theres evidence both ways
5488716 in our nation today we need less interference by the federal government on any issue such as this
5488717 i dont believe one person changing their position gives any credibility to the other side on this
5488718 law enforcement has no clear legislative guidance and medical marijuana patients have little incentive to volunteer for the cardholder program
5488719 my lawyer told me she offered me five years if i pleaded guilty
5488720 he said he didnt think i would take it but he had to ask he was right i am not going to accept that i just dont think depriving someone of his freedom for some dried plant leaves is right
5488721 its effects are quite different but there are some parallels in terms of the possible dangers from its use like alcohol people can exhibit dangerous behavior if they take excessively high doses thats why we prohibit driving while intoxicated or allowing minors to drink but its obvious that many many people can enjoy alcohol without getting into trouble with it and they should not be subjected to harsh penalties neither should adults who want to use salvia
5488722 salvia can be very strange and interesting but its not something most people consider fun its not a recreational kind of experience
5488723 most people find it bewildering its not something most people are motivated to repeat it wont ever become a popular drug the main reason people seem interested in it is because the media keeps putting out these sensational stories comparing it to lsd or marijuana that creates a misleading impression and people who try salvia expecting something like that are usually disappointed
5488724 im shocked and appalled that they can put people in prison for using salvia for personal use
5488725 the drug had just been made illegal there and he says he didnt know it was illegal i think thats believable most people wouldnt know about an obscure law being passed
5488726 im hoping to take depositions from people like dr andrew weil or daniel siebert or other experts
5488727 im looking for attorneys in their vicinities who might be willing to take a deposition
5488728 my defense will be to fall back on the fact that the jury is the ultimate judge of the law
5488729 they dont have to listen to the judge they have the power let the jury decide what kind of state they want to live in
5488730 the public may be signaling that pursuing small time marijuana users is a waste of taxpayer resources
5488731 this issue suggests that there is a libertarian streak in the thinking of massachusetts voters
5488732 voters considering the no tax scenario seem to be aware of their new hampshire neighbors contending with high property taxes to fund programs
5488733 they appear reluctant to eliminate the income tax and risk paying more with some other tax

5488770 when you look at low power fm or ultrawide band rules the technology has great promise but the commission adopted rules that constrained it to the detriment of consumers
5488771 so of course there are concerns that that the rules could be too limiting

5488797 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5488798 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5488799 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5488800 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5488801 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5488802 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5488803 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5488804 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5488805 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5488806 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5488807 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5488808 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5488809 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5488810 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5488811 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5488812 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5488813 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5488814 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5488815 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5488816 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5488817 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5488818 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5488819 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5488820 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5488821 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5488822 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5488823 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5488824 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5488825 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

5488843 information about the quality of american higher education has been monopolized by one publication
5488844 forbes focuses on academic quality and on student faculty and alumni accomplishments a lot of times rankings focus on the inputs on the class ranks test scores and acceptance rates of students seeking admission forbes emphasizes the quality of the experiences students have in the classroom and resulting success achieved in life after college
5488845 whats really valuable here is that the forbes survey compares all of the nations best colleges and universities public and private big and small without segmenting them into separate groups
5488846 students often look at very different kinds of colleges before they decide where to go a ranking like this helps them weigh those choices together

5488861 our long term goal is to produce trainers from among the inmates themselves so that the jails do not have to depend on the services of outsiders
5488862 yoga has the potential of moulding human psyche and the regular classes for inmates will certainly help them lead a better life once they have completed their term in jails
5488863 we intend to motivate the young inmates in particular for attending the classes as they have to lead a longer life after serving the jail term
5488864 there would be no compulsion to attend the classes but given the response we have got so far from the inmates and jail employees the department is confident that institutionalisation of yoga classes is going to be a successful venture

5488876 niebuhrs view was that rationality belongs to the cool observer but because of the stupidity of the average man he follows not reason but faith and this naive faith requires necessary illusion and emotionally potent oversimplifications which are provided by the myth maker to keep the ordinary person on course its not the case as the naive might think that indoctrination is inconsistent with democracy rather as this whole line of thinkers observes it is the essence of democracy

5488889 they had totally controlled our minds and bodies and there was nothing we could do about it until you gave us the precious gift of unconditional love
5488890 you were correct in interpreting our sudden departure was due to our testing to see if we could actually return to our 7th density outpost in this solar system
5488891 so this revelation was what prompted the remaining group to immediately accept this ul gift which then swept through our entire race
5488892 we are working out a deal with those operating your monument to allow us to add our own holographic program to the existing one showing the gradual takeover of our race by the dark forces from the antimatter universe
5488893 finally our outpost became devoid of sentient life and is now being repopulated by ferinki as we adjust again to this high 7th density vibration

5488895 the illuminati ruling class conspiracy is not simply a group of egomaniacle internationalist elitist if it were held together solely by secret fraternities exclusive clubs and round table groups the conspiracy would have died out long ago the unbroken authority of this cabal cannot be explained merely by the thirst for money and power of the privileged families to which its members belong the evil force that is plotting to rule the world is much more than the sum of individual political and financial ambitions

5488910 we applaud suffolk county law enforcement for addressing this incident with the seriousness and speed we have come to expect from them and hope that the perpetrators of this anti semitic crime will be brought to justice
5488911 we will not tolerate religious hatred and there will be an all out effort to arrest and prosecute those responsible
5488912 this sector is known to be extremely competitive however an obvious shortcoming has always been lack of product availability and support this is the primary reason why we have already invested in an appropriate level of stockholding which will allow customers ready access to product

5488917 we have great confidence in port elizabeth as a result of various macro economic factors the commercial capital of the eastern cape is experiencing steady growth which has led to increased pressure on the availability of housing especially for the middle income bracket
5488918 our investment in parsonsvlei is not only in line with absas strategic intent to support property development in south africa but also an investment in the economy and growth of port elizabeth as commercial property finance specialists absa would also like to extend its involvement once development on the sites starts to include the financing of developers

5488926 boschendals status as an international tourism destination with a long and colourful history magnificent scenery and quality wines is beyond doubt however our professionalism in hospitality as well as our infrastructure will be tested to the limit

5488933 io credo che vada ricordato come uno dei pi grandi personaggi della storia della roma non so se il pi grande in assoluto sicuramente innamorato dei colori io lho conosciuto fin dai miei primi passi quando io cominciavo a giocare lui era gi dirigente della roma poi le strade si sono divise non come sostenitore ma come dipendente
5488934 io avevo appena esordito e incominciavo a girare il mondo con la roma fin da allora mostrava una carica e un entusiasmo incredibili verso questa societ che ha rilevato e portato ai vertici del calcio
5488935 non ho grandi ricordi specifici perch io ero ragazzino allepoca poi come giocatore o in qualche modo come operatore di calcio ci siamo persi di vista per ho sempre apprezzato il lavoro che ha svolto per questa societ e stato innamorato della roma lo ripeto e ha sostenuto i colori anche contro il sistema a un certo punto s messo a combattere una guerra contro il palazzo da solo perch pochissimi lo hanno fiancheggiato diciamo che viene ricordato come presidente che ha portato la roma ai massimi livelli

5488937 s ma nel nome del presidente sensi credo si sia rifiutato qualsiasi discorso di cessione con eventuali acquirenti ora chiss che succeder qualcosa potrebbe cambiare ma non so in che direzione perch non li frequento troppo credo che comunque quello che ha fatto sensi per la roma stato gigantesco

5488995 lehman leh has just begun to defile itself after several quarters of losses and promises of better days the press is reporting that the brokerage will have negative earnings for the most recent period that will total at least 1 8 billion big earnings deficits are almost always followed by a need to raise money
5488996 lehman appears to have two options one is to sell off a valuable asset that might be a part of its real estate portfolio or its money management arm neuberger berman the other way out for lehman is to raise more capital via a sale of shares or debt that amount would probably have to be in excess of 4 billion if the company wants to create a cushion against future losses
5488997 either path undermines the value of lehmans common shares and that value could easily go to zero by the end of the year the companys current market cap is only 11 billion so far this year lehmans stock prices is down almost 75

5489020 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses

5489023 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5489024 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5489025 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5489026 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5489027 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5489028 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5489029 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5489030 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5489031 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children

5489078 it appears that several milf sub commanders are not controlled by the milf leadership and are just using the peace process as a blanket to launch violent attacks against the people of mindanao
5489079 there is already a pullout upon command upon orders of the leadership of the biaf milf after several hours of trying to get in touch there with fighters in lanao apparently they were reached because the command is for them to pull out from the area right now the area is clear
5489080 they held hostage the whole town but we could not enter because the civilians were being used as human shields
5489081 they pulled out already of the area they let go of the children and the women but took with them the adult men
5489082 we will not tolerate and will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao i assure the filipino people that the government will defend them at all cost against any move or any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace not only in mindanao but in the whole country

5489095 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy
5489096 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5489097 my ultimate goal is to win championships and a build a club that all of our fans will be proud of
5489098 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
5489099 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america
5489100 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5489101 our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are oppressed throughout the world i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it
5489102 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights

5489105 one of the greatest freedoms we have here in america is the freedom of speech even the freedom to protest this meeting thats a good thing but we have to learn how to have civility in our civilization how to stop being rude how to stop demonizing each other and how to have a discussion and a debate because we all want america to be a greater place

5489110 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
5489111 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
5489112 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
5489113 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
5489114 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
5489115 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful
5489116 reconstructing these frescoes is incredibly complex given the condition of the fragments and the sheer number of fragments
5489117 the computer takes over the laborious parts of the process while leaving the important intuitive decisions to the humans
5489118 the figures come as no surprise considering the pressure that todays women are under just to make themselves look good
5489119 theres a host of waxing exfoliating moisturising straightening polishing and plucking involved in getting ready for a night out when youre stretched for time or just simply want to get out see your friends and have a good time the routine of getting ready can often be an unwanted task

5489125 in a note received just now from zacks senior biotechnology analyst jason napodano cfa the food amp drug administration fda just issued a warning on amylins amln diabetes drug byetta on a potential risk for pancreatitis

5489129 im happy for them im very happy that we can talk about this subject very very happy
5489130 google is not transparent how the auction process works the highest bidder does not necessarily win because google applies a quality factor to advertisers so it cannot be easily proved whether smaller players trying to break into a market are paying fair prices
5489131 once advertisers wake up to the notion that google is overrated and that television advertising allied to a new fangled targeting is underrated then well itv might be able to afford to buy another round of fa cup rights
5489132 in april 2005 along with his editor robert thomson he was served with a criminal libel summons from a french court by the barclay brothers over an article published in the times in november 2004 that action was dropped after the times published a statement in february 2007 he was also elected as a labour councillor in the london borough of lambeth between august 1999 and may 2006
5489133 they ve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
5489134 we want the course to act as a vehicle to re engage them but we will be setting ground rules
5489135 we don t want to simply take them out of school and that is all they do there will be a clear understanding that this is an add on conditional on carrying out their normal school work
5489136 this qualification will be of use anywhere where people are trying to enthuse and inspire youngsters it will promote a can do attitude and give them a sense of achievement on which to build
5489137 it is up to individual headteachers if they think it would be appropriate for some pupils it may be that some pupils will respond but i would be sceptical
5489138 it is very much our policy that pupils who are persistently disruptive should be removed from class until they learn to behave and that is popular with teachers and parents alike
5489139 there have been various initiatives of this type and while it is maybe a bit unusual it may have a function
5489140 the ssta has no objection to anything that retains contact between children and the education system
5489141 i wouldn t support just any black candidate what i like about obama is that he s fresh he s got good ideas
5489142 they are caught up in the euphoria the possibility that you could have someone in the white house that we haven t seen before
5489143 i would make history for myself in more ways than you can imagine
5489144 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
5489145 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
5489146 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
5489147 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
5489148 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
5489149 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
5489150 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties
5489151 i prefer a man who will burn the flag and then wrap himself in the constitution to a man who will burn the constitution and then wrap himself in the flag
5489152 it looks like they got away with it scot free
5489153 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
5489154 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
5489155 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale
5489156 women who conducted their interview in english were significantly more likely to express depressive symptoms compared to women who conducted their interview in spanish
5489157 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
5489158 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
5489159 it s important because it s our way of respecting the dead
5489160 it is also a chance for the whole family from across the country to come together
5489161 it will not be disrupting anything that goes on at northridge
5489162 and generally if there is a problem i will hear about it
5489163 duhhhhhh derrrrrr um yeah ill take 10 00 in ass errr gas
5489164 i think i d recommend mostly a friend build a tiny hill and pinecone eyes i ve heard pretty varying choices as far as people s favorites but i think those are the ones that for me are the most enjoyable to play every so often i ll start getting into playing other ones like love for longer but something about those three feels very much like an amalgamation of all the music i enjoyed as a kid
5489165 i grew up listening to the music of my parents really
5489166 i seldom ventured out into current music and when i did it felt very strange like i was doing it as a social thing i grew up on a lot of doo wop and oldies and tons of black sabbath strawberry fields era beatles simon amp garfunkel and also a lot of paco de lucia and silvio rodriguez
5489167 well electronic or otherwise i think we share a penchant for things that couldn t exist in the real world or just aren t seen music that is escapist in some way or otherwise enhances the world we live in by adding an epic or magical quality to our lives as we write it and digest it it might be about attempting to make impossible things real in some ways and genre or style is secondary
5489168 it all comes in waves i think right now it s my music with my art as a supplement it seems before getting started on this record it was probably the other way around i m quite used to thinking of it all as the same thing a lot of my writing comes from ideas sparked by drawings so i really need to treat it all as one source
5489169 i think when i first discovered edward lear i felt a strong connection to his work because he was both a writer and an illustrator he was combining words and inventing them to create really unusual juxtapositions and i think my visual art and music are both about that to some extent so i feel a sort of kinship do i know what a runcible spoon is i think it s probably a primitive spork
5489170 i enjoy when people think they ve got it figured out
5489171 and share their stories with me about what they think it means it s great it s like reading a book and having minimal visual cues but you ve made up all the visuals on your own and they re so vivid usually that s your life melding with the writers the title is really a play on words something i came up with through a miscommunication with my friend whitney in the song i try to imagine the fire at a campsite producing a large cloud of smoke shaped somewhat like a bear and two characters chatting and waiting for it to dissipate
5489172 i have to be here i have to go there
5489173 oh crescere crescere diventare grosso e vecchio lunica cosa bella di questo mondo
5489174 se almeno le candele fossero accese presto che cosa accadr chiss se verranno gli alberi del bosco a vedermi e chiss se i passerotti voleranno fino alla finestra forse metter radici qui e rester decorato estate e inverno
5489175 certo chi pu mai saperlo forse cadr anchio dalle scale e sposer una principessa
5489176 voglio proprio godermi tutto quello splendore domani sentir ancora la storia di klumpe dumpe e forse anche quella di ivede avede
5489177 che cosa faccio qui che cosa posso ascoltare da qua
5489178 la terra dura e coperta di neve gli uomini non potrebbero ripiantarmi per questo devo rimanere al riparo fino a primavera che ottima idea come sono bravi gli uomini se solo qui non fosse cos buio ed io non fossi cos solo non c neppure una piccola lepre invece era proprio bello nel bosco quando cera la neve e la lepre mi passava vicino s anche quando mi saltava sopra ma allora non mi piaceva qui invece c una solitudine terribile
5489179 erano proprio bei tempi ma ritorneranno ritorneranno klumpe dumpe cadde dalle scale e ebbe la principessa forse anchio ne sposer una
5489180 to defend something is always to discredit it yes the person who defends that has never believed in it if he does believe then the enthusiasm of faith is not a defence no it is the assault and the victory a believer is a victor
5489181 thou shalt not extinguish thine anger but shall master it that thy conscience may not be blunted by adjustment to wrong causes
5489182 suffering is either meaningful or not either redemptive or simply unpleasant
5489183 alleviating poverty is a kind of anti suffering policy i can get on board with not all suffering is sacrificial redemptive awesome
5489184 that the only way they can think to respond to suffering is to want it stopped as soon as possible
5489185 habita o rural significa investir em auto estima dos agricultores e valoriza o da agricultura familiar

5489198 this is a gorgeous venue and i can just envision some really great shows here
5489199 we do this same show in hollywood too but in hollywood dane cook or jamie kennedy could come out and people are like eh they see that kind of thing a lot but the crowds in orange county just seem to appreciate it a lot more and seem to have way more fun with it
5489200 tell me if this is a woman or a little kid they cry for no reason fall down a lot wake up in the middle of the night because they had a nightmare and occasionally call you daddy
5489201 the quickest way to get out of a phone call is to ask what time it is loudly repeat the time back and then just hang up
5489202 a mustache tells the world dont trust me around your kids
5489203 im a man and i like beer and whiskey but you also know what i like the taste of strawberries
5489204 someone said look at this rich bleep and slashed my bike seat
5489205 why do gay guys always look like they just smelled cookies
5489206 do we really trust the judgment of the american people
5489207 never throw a tank top over a light bulb to create mood lighting
5489208 having walked the last 15 years this is what we believe would be most helpful to take us to the kind of future that we all want to be part of and that we all want to contribute to
5489209 so if evolution is real why dont we see foxes turning into wolves and stuff

5489231 archbishop prendergast fully supports us and we are extremely excited about its success and future walks like it
5489232 citing only one study in support of a politically desired conclusion cannot be explained in any other way than a politically motivated exercise
5489233 i knew the fix was in at that point and subsequent events have confirmed this but i gamely kept trying to talk about balance and science
5489234 a better report would be one that pointed out where the consensus is and where the controversies still are rather than taking one side in the controversy
5489235 to this moment i dont have an answer to the basic point of how one study whether an excellent study or not could possibly be reasonably seen as supporting a bold and ideologically desired conclusion
5489236 ribbon cutting at a building the building was already built all the work had already gone in so that point in time was too late
5489237 daca mergi la fantana cu galeata sparta la un moment dat va trebui sa realizezi ca ar fi bine sa o repari o vindecare reala nu poate fi conceputa fara a elimina cauzele care au determinat boala

5489239 its a thunderclap both for pakistan and its foreign supporters
5489240 the one thing the two had in common was their opposition to musharraf
5489241 a lot of pakistanis feel he is not fit to be president or prime minister of pakistan until these allegations are finally cleared up
5489242 now that hes gone they will be accountable to whats happening
5489243 theres going to be a lot of change now in pakistans policies both internally and towards afghanistan
5489244 a fight against pashtun tribesmen along the north west frontier of pakistan who are supportive of their pashtun first cousins in afghanistan
5489245 it think with all of its other troubles islamist militants in the tribal areas secessionists in baluchistan the last thing the government would want to do is stir the pot in kashmir
5489246 they apologized they said it got a little heated and emotional and in the future they will instruct their employees how to act in that situation
5489247 we are very pleased with the open dialogue and we look forward to more open conversation with the group especially about how we can collectively spread a more powerful message
5489248 we take their coats everyone talks in a big hurry as if we didnt have four long hours ahead of us we self medicate with alcohol a lot of things are discussed different issues everyone laughs a lot but later no one can say what exactly was so witty compliments on the food a couple of monologues then they start to yawn we start to yawn they say we should think about leaving huh and we politely look away like theyve just decided to take a crap on the dinner table everyone stands one of us gets their coats peppy goodbyes we all say what a lovely evening do it again soon blah blah blah and then they leave and we talk about them and they hit the streets and talk about us

5489273 honey go to my blog and read what i wrote
5489274 this is an area where families with members on both sides of the border can get together on the beach and have a picnic or bring a new born baby to show to a relative on the other side
5489275 all that will be lost if this new fence is built
5489276 if its like the fencing put up elsewhere along the border near san diego there will be two fences made with triple strength concertina wire
5489277 there will be one fence 150 meter dead zone thats big enough for a vehicle to drive and then the second fence
5489278 ninety percent of illegal migrants on that part of the border come through a legal port of entry either smuggled in a vehicle crated in tractor trailers or they come legally and overstay their visa
5489279 the logic of building the fence makes very little sense
5489280 i was detained for visiting a park where north meets south and the pacific crashes against the land a park that i have visited all of my life
5489281 i was detained for bearing witness to the ongoing destruction of that park for a triple fence will bypass the last place where families can still come together and see each other through the wall of death that separates our families and communities
5489282 when we sit around here and talk about all these tax cuts and we say its our money your money and mine i think we ought to be honest with the american people in the first place its also our debt and its our childrens debt but secondly a tax cut isnt really a tax cut long term unless you reduce spending because then it becomes a tax increase on your children so were inflicting this awful bill not simply on ourselves but most importantly on our kids and it is that phenomenon that is very troublesome
5489283 the rising cost of health care is a real problem for every family in new york state and across the country
5489284 health care providers including ambulance companies have a vital obligation to their customers taking advantage of vulnerable new yorkers by extracting excessive and undue payments is a massive insult to injury my health care bureau works to ensure that hard working consumers are not subjected to erroneous and illegal overbilling by companies like greenport
5489285 will provide leadership for our administrative functions and will collaborate
5489286 also working closely with the academic deans he will help me to address the challenges opportunities and priorities before the fas
5489287 brett sweet will be a terrific addition to the fas administrative team he will bring to the position a strong financial background strategic planning experience and the leadership skills needed to move us forward as we pursue our many goals and objectives
5489288 on the proposition that political movements best serve a developing nation by combining efforts to achieve four critical goals as opposed to one or two of them to the exclusion of others
5489289 1 the struggle for social justice 2 the struggle for democracy 3 the effort to promote national economic development and 4 the adoption of economic and political nationalism
5489290 it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around in nursing homes every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
5489291 care homes can be such miserable places it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around in homes i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with i think i can accommodate three people every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
5489292 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5489293 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5489294 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5489295 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5489296 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5489297 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5489298 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5489299 if you pass this ordinance here there will be cities all over the midwest and coasts that will pass this as well and we really need this legislation
5489300 although the ordinances stated goals to reduce the number of unwanted pets and gang activity are laudable the reality is that it the ordinance will have no effect on these problems instead it will create some serious public health concerns cause many animals to be denied necessary health care and will trample on the personal property rights of conscientious pet owners
5489301 the idea that mandatory spay neuter will change a gangbangers behavior or that dog bite injuries will vanish is absurd
5489302 the aspca supports programs that provide incentives to the public to spay or neuter their companion animals the aspca does not support local laws that mandate the sterilization of all cats and dogs
5489303 we cant even enforce the licensing of our dogs in the city

5489307 instead of having to bid for and getting people to buy your product from you you allegedly pay bribes to guarantee the other company will purchase the product from sk foods
5489308 prior to the management presentation we will only require ea to enter into a confidentiality agreement
5489309 i can assure you that this requirement is the same as or more favorable to ea than that which we have employed with all other participants in the process
5489310 prior to the management presentation we will only require ea to enter into a confidentiality agreement
5489311 scotland has become famous for its call centres but this is the wrong end of the value chain to concentrate on
5489312 canada provides outsourcing services to the uk so there is no reason why the uk cant provide outsourcing services to canada
5489313 edinburgh does not rank sixth in the world for asset management for no reason
5489314 there is a simple message to those individuals like thompson who think they can go to this website or indeed any space on the internet and discuss their sexual interest in children and share images
5489315 you leave a digital footprint we will track you down and hold you to account
5489316 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that activity such as this will not be tolerated
5489317 the governments most recent report on microgeneration predicted 90 per cent compound annual growth rate for the ground source heat pump market
5489318 even if they are wrong by a factor of three it is still a massively expanding market
5489319 were focused on heat pumps as they are mature technology that are already used prolifically in scandinavia
5489320 the only issue is the upfront capital costs but they still offer returns on investment within five to seven years even for retrofitted systems which is far quicker than other microgeneration systems such as solar panels
5489321 the type of service it is you need national coverage and a local presence
5489322 were getting inquiries in from yorkshire for example and we can respond to them far quicker with a local presence
5489323 i felt pain that first inning and told the trainer

5489326 vehicle extrication is an issue worldwide and its expensive were taking steps today to ensure that our purpose in saving lives is met our organization exists to serve the public we have one of the most well recognized brands in the world as the creator of jaws of life our goal is to meet those objectives and make a difference
5489327 were going to bring in the tools from various fire departments test them and make sure that they get into the hands of the experts who will distribute them to make the most impact its not just about tools but also training firefighters crossing borders asked for our help and we want to make a difference
5489328 by teaming with hurst jaws of life we are confident that the outdated yet functional tools donated will get into the needing hands of emergency workers in mexico and around the globe
5489329 those of us in the united states have reaped the benefits of the jaws of life for many years where its now considered the industry standard nearly every roadway in our country is complimented with a jaws of life rescue tool in less developed countries the nearest tools may be hundreds of miles away
5489330 currently our dealer network has stepped up and donated trade ins to less developed countries weve supported that and now were taking it to the next level these tools will make a difference and were committed to a positive outcome
5489331 fire departments in the states need new tools so now is the time to make the most impact
5489332 the best case scenario is a flood of tools from caring compassionate americans who show a genuine desire to help i really want to see a pile of tools sent to charity

5489349 this gentleman knows this about himself and is in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5489350 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5489351 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5489352 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama
5489353 a tiny girl with huge eyes and a tube top who looks like a slutty disney character
5489354 what would you say if you were flying into memphis and they said you are about to land at isaac hayes international airport
5489355 he is a world person who the world will miss
5489356 literacy civil rights he was always there and thats why were all here for him
5489357 thank god for isaac living 65 years and making a difference in our lives
5489358 hollywood didnt send its stars to us we sent our stars to them
5489359 isaac came from our culture he emanated our culture thats why he never lost his authenticity never lost his conviction
5489360 there would be no isaac hayes without stax and no stax without isaac hayes
5489361 hip hop wouldnt be what it is without isaac hayes
5489362 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5489363 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5489364 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5489365 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5489366 it seems more and more likely that michigan will open the season with some type of quarterback rotation adam rittenberg writes that hes a little surprised by that thought as it appeared as though steven threet would distance himself in the competition after the spring but nick sheridan is keeping pace in camp coach rich rodriguez could have a clear cut starter in his mind and just wont say but hes also seems ready to forge ahead with both threet and sheridan

5489369 from a product perspective this acquisition will propel the company forward
5489370 of course we expected the cgp to be popular because as green building grows many consumers are looking for a builder with real credentials in todays market
5489371 as we see demand for green buildings continue to grow we are seeing the market respond as people skill up and get the appropriate training
5489372 a recent federation of master builders report showed that the value of the refurbishment market will be 4bn a year and countless studies have shown that to meet carbon emission targets there needs to be a focus on retrofitting older buildings
5489373 so there is a strong case for developing these skills even in the current climate for new build
5489374 were seeing a lot of demand from employers but while you get a lot of people interested in those jobs it is a fairly limited pool of people who have the required experience and qualifications
5489375 our previous system for managing email only allowed one employee to log in at any one time

5489377 we do expect it to reach the gulf maybe as a category 1 hurricane possibly a category 2
5489378 we expect it to be a significant system as it moves over florida
5489379 its difficult to say where it will be but in three days were projecting it anywhere from the eastern gulf near the florida panhandle to the western bahamas

5489382 the honorable thing would be for the candidate that has now lost 28 out of 29 ballots to withdraw
5489383 but venezuela insists on putting everyone through this vote after vote it is clearly obstructionist
5489384 this is sheer arrogance that a group of elected officials would try to pass this paltry reduction as in any way being genuine or meaningful relief the vote is an 11th hour political stunt at the end of a long administrative budget process
5489385 and what a coincidence that it comes just as the general election season starts
5489386 this charade demonstrates the commission is unwilling or incapable of taking our challenges seriously

5489399 nationally local governments have been struggling with soaring health care costs for many years
5489400 the awareness of the new liability and the requirement to disclose it has created heightened concerns regarding the affordability of public sector health care
5489401 fewer than 30 percent of the respondents have made changes to co pays or deductibles in the last two years

5489413 that refugee protection for military deserters and evaders is only available where the conduct objected to amounts to a war crime a crime against peace or a crime against humanity
5489414 officially condoned military misconduct falling well short of a war crime may a support a claim to refugee protection
5489415 i believe in a canada that grants asylum to principled young americans that said no to an illegal war

5489442 aleritas management made the right decisions and implemented the proper strategies to position the company for a profitable 2008 second quarter
5489443 we are encouraged by the second quarter results and a return to profitability although we made significant progress during the second quarter a source of frustration has been delays in the payment of servicing fees to our organization and brooke capital by securitization trusts these servicing fees total approximately 7 0 million and the delays have adversely impacted our organizations cash flows as the result of recent discussions with the securitization trusts we believe that most servicing fees will be received within the next 60 days
5489444 mike hess leads our communications initiatives and has been the primary liaison with our main street participating lenders i have been the primary liaison with our institutional partners
5489445 aleritas capital took its medicine in the first quarter and started getting well in the second quarter
5489446 i believe i can now redirect much of my attention to brooke capital corporation in an effort to help it return to profitability in the third quarter brooke capital provides collateral preservation servicing for aleritas capitals securitization trusts and as such its financial well being is important to aleritas and its secondary market participants and investors
5489447 we still have a lot of work to do but being profitable in the second quarter is certainly a step in the right direction communication is key to continuing our business relationships and to continuing profitability our communication initiatives implemented earlier in the year encourage due diligence and on site visits by participating lenders servicers large investors and others however our efforts to be transparent have strained resources as we have tried to honor all requests for information on a timely basis
5489448 aleritas capital was profitable in the second quarter despite virtually originating no new loans during the quarter until credit markets improve aleritas capital will focus on collection of existing loans and assisting existing borrowers

5489660 we originally planned a benefit concert at hill auditorium for sept 21 of this year but with the economy the way it is corporate sponsors are a bit more difficult to find so the date will most likely be moved back unless we get a miracle in my world miracles happen often

5489733 i find the ethical considerations of supervised injections to be profoundly disturbing
5489734 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5489735 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5489736 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5489737 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5489738 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial

5489760 some of them were just bad timing in the pc market the pc market was lousy last year some of it was the fact that we were an independent studio we didnt have unlimited money and we had to ship when we had to ship part of it was because we overreached and that was a design problem that was totally our fault we tried to do too much we tried to be a standalone game and a free play game and an mmo and an rpg and a shooter we were trying to be something for everybody and ended up really not pleasing many people at all

5489787 i had to learn how to start all over again walking you name it
5489788 initially most people felt that it was a relatively mild infection and that people recover from it very quickly
5489789 i think this paper as well as a couple of papers out of the u s in the last couple of years have really hit home the fact that this disease has a tremendous impact on people
5489790 and a year to recovery is a long time and even people with what we thought was the more mild form of the disease are significantly debilitated for a period of time
5489791 whats interesting and what surprised us was the fact that there seems to be a lot of resiliency in individuals who had the encephalitis or meningitis or the milder symptoms
5489792 i was young too when my mother died i was five so you got to talk to them cope with them and let them know everything is going to be alright
5489793 ill just sit him down comfort him and just let him know that they were in a house fire and it was out of our hands there was nothing we could do about it
5489794 so you just have to be outspoken and let them know that everything is going to be alright
5489795 you know its not so much talking that you do but the love you show for them and the hugs you give them and the respect and to let them know youre sad too
5489796 if theyre infected with west nile where they have west nile fever or they have west nile virus meningitis or encephalitis these data can tell them what to expect that gradually over about a year their mental and physical function generally and on average will return to normal

5489814 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course
5489815 whether i win or lose the impeachment the dignity of the nation would be damaged the office of the president harmed
5489816 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed
5489817 pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5489818 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5489819 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5489820 when i took over nine years ago this country was on the verge of being declared a terrorist state on the verge of becoming a failed state
5489821 the challenges of the last nine years have been greater than any in pakistans history yet i have met those challenges
5489822 thank god hes resigned the country will do much better now its a victory for the people
5489823 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5489824 benazir bhutto and all those who sacrificed their lives for democracy
5489825 for 44 years i have safeguarded the country and will continue to do so
5489826 no charge sheet can stand against me not even a single charge can be proven against me as i have full trust in allah almighty and i did everything with the belief of pakistan first
5489827 all stake holders whether they were soldiers politicians bureaucrats members of civil society ulema were consulted in all decisions
5489828 impeachment is their governments right and to face it is my right
5489829 i believe that no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did things for my own self but for my country
5489830 i am not afraid of impeachment because not a single charge can be proved against me
5489831 i am leaving with this satisfaction that i did my best with honesty and responsibility
5489832 we held elections twice the senate national assembly and local government all completed their terms this is the essence of democracy
5489833 i am proud of all these achievements all done for pakistan and its people
5489834 unfortunately all my appeals towards reconciliation and to address the complicated issues fell on deaf ears
5489835 certain vested interests began an atmosphere of confrontation and of vendetta they blamed me of hatching conspiracies from aiwan e sadr
5489836 had it been a conspiracy we would not have done it
5489837 i publicly announced support to the government and offered to share all my experience with them to help address complicated issues it was confronting
5489838 the coalition considered me a problem and not a solution
5489839 are they afraid of me or my obligations under the constitution
5489840 i have fought two wars for pakistan and still have the same spirit for my country
5489841 i took power of the country when it was at the brink of being declared a failed state
5489842 whosoever says that our policies for last nine years were faulty and unsatisfactory should not damage pakistan
5489843 forget about the past and focus on future the government should find solutions for the problems and take the country forward

5489856 we came from a situation where we produced 5 000 kg of corn by hectare while today it is 10 to 12 000 kg per hectare of corn
5489857 we have more chinese people eating we have more indians eating we have more africans eating and we have a lot more brazilians eating
5489858 all this which is treated by the press as if it were a crisis and is sold to the world as if it were a crisis
5489859 without any arrogance or self importance we brazilians need to confront what for others is a crisis as an extraordinary opportunity to truly transform ourselves into the granary of the world as many people have long predicted
5489860 without any doubt there is potential to produce if the government doesnt get in the way
5489861 we are not even going to say help if they dont get in the way a lot year by year the producer is generally increasing production
5489862 if you talk about central brazil there are still a lot of areas to be exploited so i dont have much doubt
5489863 what we have seen in the last 10 years is a quiet revolution happening in our country mostly in agribusiness production
5489864 we came from being an irrelevant international market participant to be one of the worlds major food and biofuel suppliers today
5489865 so if you look at what happened to our agriculture in terms of beef exports poultry exports again we were irrelevant and now we have the position of largest exporter in the world in major food crops
5489866 the impact will start to emerge with more intensity within 20 to 30 years and until then we should be preparing for this
5489867 the perspective for the moment for future harvests is highly productive so brazil has the potential to continue growing around 5 to 6 a year in terms of increasing harvests we are going to effectively maintain this rhythm in the coming years without any problem
5489868 we are not against expanding the brazilian capacity for producing food and helping brazil to develop this country
5489869 you can increase the food capacity through technology through better practices through occupying areas that are already degraded to investing in better crops
5489870 but you can not increase your productivity at the expense of the environment because the global market doesnt accept this price any more
5489871 if we have the right investments coming on for logistics for infrastructure and for technology and land development the country can multiply by two and a half three times the actual production in the next 10 years
5489872 of course we have increases that could come from europe from the usa from canada from argentina
5489873 but where you see the best conditions in order to give the world society the best rate of return in terms of investment is in brazil

5489876 next up is africa i think for africa this could be a redemption in terms of inclusion of people in production systems and making africa produce food and biofuels for the world
5489877 world demand for food today is one billion tonnes and brazil produces 150 million tonnes
5489878 brazil produces 150 million tonnes and the plan launched by the government for more food will produce six million more which is going to leave one million for export how is brazil going to be the granary of food production

5489943 john mccain shot down bayoneted tortured offered early release he said no hed sworn an oath

5489946 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make and what was the process that you used to make it
5489947 it was long ago and far away in a prison camp in north vietnam
5489948 but i said no and ill never forget sitting in my last answer and the high ranking officer offered it slammed the door and the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was but not only the toughest decision i ever made but i am most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life
