870033 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
870034 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the the western australian liberal party
870035 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
870036 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
870037 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes

870045 it also allows muslims to practice self discipline sacrifice and sympathy for those who are less fortunate
870046 now umm its not really much sacrifice if you dont lose anything amiright but hey its all good if i were religious id totally be the band wagon fair weather sort of religious person like yourself id probably do something like look up the time in mecca the holy muslim city and tell everyone that because im such a good and religious muslim im going to observe ramadan as i would if i were in the holy city of mecca mecca is about 12 hours different from where you are in the us give or take that means when the sun is up here its down over there now you can eat just like you normally do that way you can honor your religion by making a huge sacrifice without actually giving anything up best of both worlds you get eternity in heaven or whatever it is and you can just shrug off all the no fun lame dont eat when the sun is up part of your religion really i think by taking only the good happy fun aspects of a religion and ignoring all the other stuff you end up with a much cooler religion edudbors epic training http forum bodybuilding com showthread php p 159328841 age 18 stats 61

870082 i never saw the messenger of allah fast a complete month save for ramadan and i have never seen him fast more in a month than he did in syaaban
870083 o messenger of allah i never find you fasting in any month like you do during the month of syaaban
870084 that is a month the people neglect it comes between rajab and ramadan it is a month in which the deeds are raised to the lord of the worlds i love that my deeds be raised while i am fasting

870098 my knowledge is that hsbc board could not decide whether to extend the deal because the price renegotiation has not finished
870099 the theory is that if gas prices go up people walk or bike more or they take public transportation which requires walking to and from stops on either end
870100 also people eat out less when gas prices are high because they would have to drive to the restaurant and they have less disposable income
870101 i found that a permanent one dollar rise in gas prices is associated with a seven percent drop in overweight and a nine percent drop in obesity
870102 achieving just the minimum 35 miles per gallon fleet wide average by 2020 would cut oil use by 1 1 million barrels a day
870103 cutting the cost of gasoline at todays prices by more than a dollar per gallon
870104 further achieving a 35 mpg fleet wide average would create 149 000 new jobs nationwide in 2020

870147 in the current economy its important to think fashionable but also focus on getting the longest wear life out of a wardrobe
870148 this can often be achieved by layering for a lasting quality allowing the wearer to take the look from the fall season into the winter months

870161 the bathroom was a hole in the ground and you had to sleep on the ground
870162 it was not at all glamorous but rather frightening full of naked women in a dark room splashing water on you and rubbing your back painfully hard
870163 i was angry at my parents for being so loose and carefree both me and my sister became focused on our careers which is quite rebellious i guess

870193 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea
870194 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
870195 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
870196 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion ninety nine percent of the time it works out for us

870199 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
870200 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
870201 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
870202 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
870203 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
870204 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
870205 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it
870206 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission

870219 at this stage hell play the season out unless he believes he cant contribute
870220 its going to mean that at times our young defenders are going to take up some big jobs to help him out
870221 he is still our best defender and he is very keen as the leader to support the team through a tough year and hes fit enough to do it at the moment
870222 oh yeah in my house its just falsetto rapa nui rapa nui rapa nui
870223 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain world domination by the dissolution of other races and by the establishment of a world republic in which everywhere the jews will exercise the privilege of citizenship in this new world order the children of israel will furnish all the leaders without encountering opposition
870224 lets keep our boots polished bayonets sharpened and present a picture of force and strength to the red army this is the only language they understand and respect
870225 oh george you have been so close to this thing so long you have lost sight of the big picture
870226 i understand the situation their the soviet supply system is inadequate to maintain them in a serious action such as i could put to them they have chickens in the coop and cattle on the hoof thats their supply system they could probably maintain themselves in the type of fighting i could give them for five days after that it would make no difference how many million men they have and if you wanted moscow i could give it to you they lived on the land coming down there is insufficient left for them to maintain themselves going back lets not give them time to build up their supplies if we do then we have had a victory over the germans and disarmed them but we have failed in the liberation of europe we have lost the war
870227 i have never seen in any army at any time including the german imperial army of 1912 as severe discipline as exists in the russian army the officers with few exceptions give the appearance of recently civilized mongolian bandits
870228 everything they the russians did impressed one with the idea of virility and cruelty
870229 in my opinion the american army as it now exists could beat the russians with the greatest of ease because while the russians have good infantry they are lacking in artillery air tanks and in the knowledge of the use of the combined arms whereas we excel in all three of these if it should be necessary to right the russians the sooner we do it the better
870230 if we have to fight them now is the time from now on we will get weaker and they stronger
870231 these people do not understand toilets and refuse to use them except as repositories for tin cans garbage and refuse they decline where practicable to use latrines preferring to relieve themselves on the floor
870232 where although room existed the jews were crowded together to an appalling extent and in practically every room there was a pile of garbage in one corner which was also used as a latrine the jews were only forced to desist from their nastiness and clean up the mess by the threat of the butt ends of rifles of course i know the expression lost tribes of israel applied to the tribes which disappeared not to the tribe of judah from which the current sons of bitches are descended however it is my personal opinion that this too is a lost tribe lost to all decency
870233 this happened to be the feast of yom kippur so they were all collected in a large wooden building which they called a synagogue it behooved general eisenhower to make a speech to them we entered the synagogue which was packed with the greatest stinking bunch of humanity i have ever seen when we got about halfway up the head rabbi who was dressed in a fur hat similar to that worn by henry viii of england and in a surplice heavily embroidered and very filthy came down and met the general the smell was so terrible that i almost fainted and actually about three hours later lost my lunch as the result of remembering it
870234 evidently the virus started by morgenthau and baruch of a semitic revenge against all germans is still working harrison a u s state department official and his associates indicate that they feel german civilians should be removed from houses for the purpose of housing displaced persons there are two errors in this assumption first when we remove an individual german we punish an individual german while the punishment is not intended for the individual but for the race furthermore it is against my anglo saxon conscience to remove a person from a house which is a punishment without due process of law in the second place harrison and his ilk believe that the displaced person is a human being which he is not and this applies particularly to the jews who are lower than animals
870235 no ss means no more in germany than being a democrat in america that is not to be quoted i mean by that that initially the ss people were special sons of bitches but as the war progressed they ran out of sons of bitches and then they put anybody in there some of the top ss men will be treated as criminals but there is no reason for trying someone who was drafted into this outfit
870236 i think that this non fraternization is very stupid if we are going to keep american soldiers in a country they have to have some civilians to talk to furthermore i think we could do a lot for the german civilians by letting our soldiers talk to their young people
870237 of course i know that even your extensive powers are limited but i do hope that wherever and whenever you can you will do what you can to make the german populace suffer for gods sake please dont ever go soft in regard to them nothing could ever be too bad for them
870238 i doubted the expediency of blowing up factories because the ends for which the factories are being blown up that is preventing germany from preparing for war can be equally well attained through the destruction of their machinery while the buildings can be used to house thousands of homeless persons
870239 i am frankly opposed to this war criminal stuff it is not cricket and is semitic i am also opposed to sending pows to work as slaves in foreign lands where many will be starved to death
870240 i have been at frankfurt for a civil government conference if what we are doing to the germans is liberty then give me death i cant see how americans can sink so low it is semitic and i am sure of it
870241 today we received orders in which we were told to give the jews special accommodations if for jews why not catholics mormons etc we are also turning over to the french several hundred thousand prisoners of war to be used as slave labor in france it is amusing to recall that we fought the revolution in defense of the rights of man and the civil war to abolish slavery and have now gone back on both principles
870242 berlin gave me the blues we have destroyed what could have been a good race and we are about to replace them with mongolian savages and all europe will be communist its said that for the first week after they took it berlin all women who ran were shot and those who did not were raped i could have taken it instead of the soviets had i been allowed
870243 it is indeed unfortunate mon general that the english and the americans have destroyed in europe the only sound country and i do not mean france therefore the road is now open for the advent of russian communism
870244 actually the germans are the only decent people left in europe its a choice between them and the russians i prefer the germans
870245 what we are doing is to destroy the only semi modern state in europe so that russia can swallow the whole
870246 the nazi thing is just like a democrat republican fight
870247 there is a very apparent semitic influence in the press they are trying to do two things first implement communism and second see that all businessmen of german ancestry and non jewish antecedents are thrown out of their jobs they have utterly lost the anglo saxon conception of justice and feel that a man can be kicked out because somebody else says he is a nazi they were evidently quite shocked when i told them i would kick nobody out without the successful proof of guilt before a court of law another point which the press harped on was the fact that we were doing too much for the germans to the detriment of the dps most of whom are jews i could not give the answer to that one because the answer is that in my opinion and that of most nonpolitical officers it is vitally necessary for us to build germany up now as a buffer state against russia in fact i am afraid we have waited too long
870248 i will probably be in the headlines before you get this as the press is trying to quote me as being more interested in restoring order in germany than in catching nazis i cant tell them the truth that unless we restore germany we will insure that communism takes america
870249 i would like it much better than being a sort of executioner to the best race in europe
870250 in thinking over the situation i could not but be impressed with the belief that at the present moment the unblemished record of the american army for non political activities is about to be lost everyone seems to be more interested in the effects which his actions will have on his political future than in carrying out the motto of the united states military academy duty honor country i hope that after the current crop of political aspirants has been gathered our former tradition will be restored
870251 i have been just as furious as you at the compilation of lies which the communist and semitic elements of our government have leveled against me and practically every other commander in my opinion it is a deliberate attempt to alienate the soldier vote from the commanders because the communists know that soldiers are not communistic and they fear what eleven million votes of veterans would do
870252 all the general officers in the higher brackets receive each morning from the war department a set of american newspaper headlines and with the sole exception of myself they guide themselves during the ensuing day by what they have read in the papers
870253 it is my present thought that when i finish this job which will be around the first of the year i shall resign not retire because if i retire i will still have a gag in my mouth i should not start a limited counterattack which would be contrary to my military theories but should wait until i can start an all out offensive
870254 no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country you win a war by making the other dumb bastard die for his country
870255 i would rather have a german division in front of me than a french division behind me
870256 moral courage is the most valuable and usually the most absent characteristic in men
870257 for diverse political reasons many extremely high ranking persons hated patton i know who killed him because i am the one who was hired to do it ten thousand dollars general william j wild bill donovan himself director of o s s entrusted ne with the mission i set up the accident since he didnt die in the accident he was kept in isolation in the hospital where he was killed with a cyanide injection
870258 espionage is not a nice thing nor are the methods employed exemplary neither are demolition bombs nor poison gas we face an enemy who believes one of his chief weapons is the fact that none but he will employ terror but we will turn terror against him
870259 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers

870265 there are concerns the economy may be slowing faster than expected senior analyst lee wai tuck said from singapore
870266 the economy may slow we dont use the word recession the economy may slow too quickly
870267 it now is obvious to almost everyone that extremely tight financial conditions are bringing the australian economy to a screeching halt he said
870268 as i said to the treasurer wayne swan i dont think his outrage is going to do too much good he said
870269 the best way to do it reduce bank lending rates is through the reserve bank because the reserve bank is in a position to see the balance sheets of the banks and the treasurer isnt
870270 in conjunction with other economic data released in recent months the job advertisements series provides further evidence that the current level of interest rates is achieving the rbas desired slowing in domestic economic growth he said
870271 there will be scope for the reserve bank to take its foot off the brake he said

870277 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
870278 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
870279 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well

870287 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
870288 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
870289 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
870290 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
870291 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
870292 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
870293 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe

870295 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
870296 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

870304 cornyn sees himself as in two election fights the one in texas being the least important
870305 the one up in washington for advancement within the senate i think he has clearly in mind as well
870306 unfortunately the democratic leadership in congress led by senator reid speaker pelosi and senator obama has erected a political blockade around americas energy resources
870307 sen cornyn calls on democratic leadership to address long term solution to medicare payment system
870308 what some might view as partisan many others would view as a senator simply staying true to his principles and standing up for what he thinks is right
870309 senator cornyn will not apologize for holding senator reids feet to the fire and demanding that the senate take action on high gas prices particularly when so many texas families are getting hit in their pocketbooks
870310 hes got to run against someone because he cant run on his record
870311 its just a last ditch effort to keep the scumbag breathing
870312 he never should have been breathing in the first place i dont care i really dont care what anyone thinks about this except texas i love texas texas is in my blood
870313 displayed a callous cruel and cavalier attitude toward the two girls that he had raped and helped to murder surely no juror or judge will ever forget his words or his sordid deeds
870314 im where i am because i made an adolescent choice thats it
870315 my life is in black and white like old western movies
870316 but unlike the movies the good guys dont always finish first
870317 most of our friends abroad have long since come to the conclusion that this country on this topic just doesnt get it
870318 this state is seen as uncaring and hateful and this case is just right on the top
870319 most texans however consider death a just penalty in certain rare circumstances many europeans disagree so be it
870320 unfortunately i doubt that the international community is likely to brush this off as simply the actions of texas in the international community and under all u s treaty obligations the united states is responsible for texas actions
870321 if i lost a child i would never stop trying to find out what happened who was responsible
870322 in the courtroom hes strong as iron and knows the law
870323 hes the best trial attorney i ever went up against
870324 intuitive and articulate hes also one of the nicest guys in the courthouse hell always stop and ask how youre doing
870325 why it overpressured thats what theyll have to figure out
870326 the problem isnt so much proving the issue that there had been sexual contact
870327 the bigger issue is proving who did it so unless the child testifies that she had sex with a mr a or mr b you dont have any proof who did it
870328 the lord blessed me to go forward in marriage july 27 2006 the day after i turned 15 years old
870329 i was shown that i should perform three marriage sealings tonight
870330 i did gather my daughter and her mother annette in this afternoon and gave her a training on how to be a heavenly wife and to get close to her husband
870331 father said the lord would like you to get married tonight now what do you think of that are you willing
870332 we told them the day of the indictments we were going to face that thing
870333 all this is much less than beyond a reasonable doubt
870334 ive pissed away three booms in my lifetime but this time no
870335 with the price of oil like it is we should be able to get this paid off while the price is still up
870336 boom times are back for now but resource driven regions like the permian basin face a recurring dilemma
870337 at the bottom of every cycle when the oil industry is shrinking and times are tough nothing is pursued with more fervor than industrial diversification
870338 yet on the way up the oil industry can be so profitable it pushes other businesses to the side
870339 and its something that people are thinking about all the time
870340 when you see our garbage trucks start up you never see a big plume of black smoke
870341 you can look under the hood of one of those trucks and it looks like the old cars i used to be able to work on
870342 you dont need an elaborate fuel and pollution control system
870343 you can feel the fuel going through the line when it stops the car is full
870344 theres not much room back there left to put things
870345 these vehicles just couldnt go far enough without having to be refilled
870346 our folks just couldnt always count on making it back to a refueling facility before running out of gas
870347 everywhere i go people want to ask me all about my car
870348 they want to know how it runs it runs just the same as any other car
870349 im convinced that if more city fleets could be converted to using natural gas we could improve the environment use a fuel that we can produce ourselves and free up gasoline supplies for the general public

870357 in the heavily documented world of the 21st century it is difficult for us to imagine how chasms of discrepancy could have formed in the historical record
870358 while obama was abroad the campaign actually launched a crafty two front ad strategy carefully calibrated to inflict maximum damage on the dem with minimal backlash the press may have been too focused on mccains easily mockable blunders to get the message but were willing to bet that swing voters werent
870359 adkisson targeted the church officer still wrote in the document obtained by wbir tv channel 10 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
870360 capable to become the commander in chief of a superpower without seeming presumptuous
870361 he is well aware voters here at home might see that as presumptuous
870362 whether by the end of this week he will be seen as presumptuous or overly cocky
870363 that means walking the fine line between looking presidential and appearing arrogant and presumptuous
870364 plus the growing sense in some quarters that the presumptive democratic nominee is getting a little presumptuous
870365 for the first few months of the campaign the question about obama was who is he the question now is who does he think he is
870366 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
870367 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
870368 if you dont find god in the next person you meet it is a waste of time looking for him further
870369 it is our duty as men and women to behave as though limits to our ability do not exist we are co creators of the universe
870370 whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now
870371 the only people who get anywhere interesting are the people who get lost
870372 and the day came when it was more painful to remain tight in a bud than the risk it took to blossom
870373 education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army
870374 watch your thoughts they become words watch your words they become actions watch your actions they become habits watch your habits they become character watch your character it becomes your destiny
870375 we all know that a rocket burns most of its fuel during the first few moments of flight as it overcomes inertia and the gravitational pull of the earth thats what its like for us as we launch our dreams into physical reality
870376 at the critical juncture in all human relationships there is only one question what would love do now
870377 success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of concentration and perseverance
870378 the road to success is not to be run upon by seven leagued boots step by step little by little bit by bit that is the way to wealth that is the way to wisdom that is the way to glory pounds are the sons not of pounds but of pence
870379 in the private sanctuary of ones own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential
870380 it is never too late to be what you might have been
870381 you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget that errand
870382 it had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them they went out and happened to things
870383 wherever you are is always the right place there is never a need to fix anything to hitch up the bootstraps of the soul and start at some higher place start right where you are
870384 everything you need you already have you are complete right now you are a whole total person not an apprentice person on the way to someplace else
870385 who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous
870386 having been to a few hall of fame functions i know my life will never be the same
870387 when he played i used to hope the quarterback would throw his way
870388 because i had that confidence he would be there to knock it away or pick it off
870389 there was something about me or something about that situation where i always figured i could make plays and i was going to make plays
870390 we had a tall defensive line and three linebackers who could drop back and had pretty good pass coverage skills i played with lanier and jim lynch on the right side and we would talk consistently about what was coming and what was going to happen
870391 the old afl was trying to put a product out there to get a tv contract so they threw the ball a lot and i had a lot of opportunities
870392 i could play the clarinet and read music but i wasnt going to be a professional musician
870393 everyone in my hometown thought i was going to be a professional baseball player i had great ball skills even 8 9 years old playing little league and when i got in high school i could always catch the ball i just had the instinct the anticipation
870394 i got a lot of calls when i was first nominated for the hall of fame from a lot of guys i played with and a lot of bishop alumni around the world now that ive gotten into canton the college will live in the hearts and minds forever
870395 i saw a guy who ran a 4 3 40 and we were looking for speed at the corners
870396 he had great range good hands excellent speed and great anticipation he was like the seventh or eighth wide receiver and we were wasting his talent
870397 i thought i had a good opportunity after a week watching all the other guys
870398 i was bigger and faster than them tom bettis took an interest in me right off the bat he saw something in me he really drilled and worked me hard stayed on me and molded me
870399 i never had any leg trouble or groins or twisted muscles
870400 the best thing about emmitt was you knew he was going to be there every day he was going to play the hardest he could play
870401 he was consistently good every game he didnt have these real good games and these real bad games he was consistently a great player
870402 cornerback is probably the hardest position to play on a football team youre out there with the best receivers in the world and they know where theyre going and you dont know where theyre going but he had the instincts the speed and athletic skill
870403 emmitt did his homework it goes back to his knowledge of the game he knew every step of what the receiver and quarterback were going to do he knew what was coming
870404 today you might play against a great receiver one week and the next week you might not every week we faced great receivers against oakland denver san diego all kinds of hall of famers he had to play against every week
870405 on offense otis taylor made a lot of big plays and on defense emmitt would come up with the plays
870406 once he made the interception he could run he had the ability to get us in great field position or even score a touchdown
870407 he was to the defense what otis taylor was to the offense
870408 kansas city is a small market and emmitt was never the flamboyant guy out talking to everybody and on tv all the time
870409 he was a quiet guy and when you have so many great players on the team some get lost in the shuffle and a lot of people who vote for the hall of fame will say well the chiefs have this many players in there so there may be a quota there

870452 and in the summer theres an upswing in buyers asking about backup power
870453 is people think they know what harlem is and they havent a clue first of all theyre not
870454 now did she do anything offensive no all she did was come to me to buy a house i showed her how to buy a house
870455 hello reverend wright weve got our little racists running around some of them want harlem to stay black they actually think harlem was built by and for black people and we have to tell them all the time excuse me dear we werent here we didnt even lay the bricks right some of us worked on the subway tunnel okay but this was built by and for upper middle class white folks we were the second and third owners we were never and i mean zero nunca never the first owner of all these houses
870456 you dont have a god given right to own your house till the end of time
870457 unless you actually own your house were not talking about a country like italy thats for italians were talking about a neighborhood in the united states of america theres nothing that says harlem has to be black

870480 my job is not to make profits larger although i care about a healthy oil industry

870489 im sure paris would tell you that herself shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it
870490 its getting increasingly evident that this is a once in a century type of phenomenon
870491 not the standard type of liquidity crisis that we have seen in the past
870492 its still very evident from inter bank lending spreads that we have not gotten closure yet
870493 its essentially fundamentally the price of homes in the united states which are determining the ultimate collateral of mortgage backed bonds pretty much around the world
870494 were still nowhere near the bottom of the home price thing
870495 ultra expansionary us monetary policies with artificially low interest rates led to bubbles all over the world and in every imaginable asset class the price of gold more than doubled in nominal terms and against the dow jones industrial average
870496 central banks of necessity determine what the money supply is
870497 if you are on a gold standard or other mechanism in which the central banks do not have discretion then the system works automatically
870498 the reason there is now very little support for the gold standard is the consequences of those types of market adjustments are not considered to be appropriate in the 20th and 21st century i am one of the rare people who have still some nostalgic view about the old gold standard as you know but i must tell you i am in a very small minority among my colleagues on that issue
870499 hey buddy need a couple of hundred thou for a house
870500 i served for two years on the freddie mac loan prospector advisory committee
870501 they claimed it was so they could hear from bankers and brokers about what they could do with not only their automated underwriting decision but how freddie could improve
870502 we as a group came up with many ideas yet the real reason we met in places like new orleans and the ritz in suburban washington was to promote their agenda
870503 they sent an armada of their people to the meetings and never really considered what we had to say
870504 during the peak of the bubble frenzy people would always ask me just how bad it could get
870505 i always said that some major bank failures and either bankruptcies or takeovers of some large home builders to possibly be followed by a federal bailout of the gses government sponsored enterprises would be the worst case scenario that scenario has now arrived
870506 if joe and jane taxpayer are going to be asked to bail them out during their time of peril they should also be able to participate and be rewarded in their future recovery
870507 what is going on is that a realistic view of the role of regulation has finally sunk in at the federal reserve the subprime problem was not unknown there but the attitude was that the markets could handle it
870508 well they cant so we will likely see a lot more regulatory activity in the housing and financial markets
870509 i am currently involved with one specific deal where the appraiser has insisted on making three return trips to the condo being financed and is still contending that minor touch up paint and tile work be completed before he gives the ok for the bank to release or sign off on the loan
870510 agents and sellers previously insulated from the changing financial landscape
870511 are starting to get the idea that this crisis is in fact going to affect them
870512 we would be very interested in assets that arent core to wachovias business
870513 i think youll see a lot of that over the next six to 12 months
870514 i cant imagine that markets like philadelphia would ever be considered noncore by wachovia
870515 they should sell their new york city locations where they have been a total failure
870516 i think from new york south theyre pretty well entrenched
870517 those deposit franchises have a lot of value but my guess is when wachovia talks about the northeast they mean new york and new england from philadelphia they have such a good earnings stream they dont want to cut that off
870518 she was very small but very big in what she did you know how you hear on the news when someone dies that they always helped everyone and it isnt always true
870519 if you broke your glasses somalie would fix them if you lost an earring one day i came in with one missing and she said give me your necklace the next day she came in with two new earrings made out of my necklace whatever was broke she would fix
870520 her family gave us incense and i was trying to stick my candle on the pavement it took me five minutes i said to my sister if somalie had been here shed tell us to step back and shed make a beautiful display but shed tell us very nicely and it would not make us feel bad
870521 all her painting sculpting and sewing she learned on her own
870522 as soon as you put her in a class and said you have to do it it was not fun anymore as soon as you tried to pay her for something there was no more passion
870523 we will actually come and put one in their homes
870524 when youre a teenager you just take everything in you absorb all these ideas
870525 it just opened my mind not only to new ideas but just that theres a bigger world out there and that i can do anything i want and so when i got home i was like im going to be a filmmaker thats when i decided when i was about 17 and i stuck to my guns
870526 theyre revealing themselves in a way that could follow them for the rest of their lives
870527 i felt the weight of that responsibility when i was making it
870528 i knew i wanted it to be a town that had only one high school
870529 and i wanted it to be economically mixed and i was hoping for it to be racially mixed but that was hard to find in the midwest in small towns
870530 much more than my film and theres much more of an emphasis on wealth and competition
870531 more stagy we want to control everything in america its unfortunate
870532 i think theres something mean spirited about a lot of them too theyre appealing to the basest part of ourselves weve become bottom feeders
870533 i think that because this film is about teenagers there is a natural assumption that its influenced by reality tv because there is so much reality tv about teenagers
870534 but a lot of reality tv got their cues from documentaries and now documentaries are being criticized for learning things from reality tv funny
870535 there were parallel story lines a bit more like you have in
870536 so it was written like that but in the editing process my editor and i realized it wasnt working that left us in a kind of crisis especially me because everybody really liked the script everybody loved the script and i remember going into the shoot with a huge attitude like i knew i had the cast and i knew i had the script and i felt like nothing could go wrong and then it was like waking up we saw the first rough cut and discovered that it didnt work at all
870537 i tell you man people dont doubt you anymore but you cant believe the hype dont believe the hype thats very important
870538 so its a very personal film but dont expect too much each film has to be whatever lets see
870539 this is all just showboatin see this guy right here you think he can do anything about the economy the economy runs on its own cycles no matter whos in there
870540 the effects of leaders are very strong in autocratic settings but much less so in the presence of democratic institutions

870592 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
870593 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from eight to 80
870594 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it

870609 we see this as an opportunity to bring us together and lift up the country
870610 we have all tribes on the team and there is no problem
870611 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
870612 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
870613 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
870614 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
870615 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
870616 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up
870617 we have been pulling out our staff on a gradual basis anyway in preparation for a prolonging of this dispute
870618 we will take strong military counter actions against even the slightest hostile actions in the tourist resort in the area of mount kumgang and the area under military control from now on
870619 they have a lot of very big challenges but one of the things is working with the other institutions including the army and the intelligence service
870620 they need to get everybody lined up in the same direction if they are going to tackle the terrorist problem
870621 this reinforces what we have long known that the gun lobby will go to any lengths no matter how unethical to protect the profits of the gun industry in this country
870622 upi newswire nra using paid informants to spy on gun violence prevention groups is easy since movement relies largely on volunteers
870623 you mentioned the gun position ive been talking about the second amendment being an individual right for the last year and a half so there wasnt a shift there
870624 said consistently that i believe that the second amendment is an individual right and that was the essential decision that the supreme court came down on
870625 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control you said in idaho recently i have no intention of taking away folks guns but you support the d c handgun ban
870626 he also opposed letting people use a self defense argument if charged with violating local handgun bans by using weapons in their homes the bill was a reaction to a chicago area man who after shooting an intruder was charged with a handgun violation
870627 our position is firm there will be no cooperation with the so called international criminal court
870628 the correct position for the au therefore should be to investigate ourselves
870629 these colonial superpowers are waging a targeted campaign against our country
870630 the highest national interest is the eu membership and we will not give it up but this does not mean that the government will agree to any blackmail
870631 if someone thinks that this pro european government will give up on defending national interests for the sake of european perspectives they are wrong
870632 zimbabweans are looking at the current talks with cautious optimism they are very weary of the likely outcome from these negotiations as you are aware in 1987 there were negotiations between the zanu pf and zapu zimbabwe african peoples union and the negotiations came up with a unity agreement that basically failed to address the core issues basically the agreement led to the annihilation of the opposition in matabeleland
870633 zimbabweans are quite weary that for the mdc to go and negotiate with the zanu pf such a scenario like the previous talks might come out of those negotiations the second thing is that zimbabweans are quite cognizant that whatever negotiations take place their will or their decision in march 29 is non negotiable which means that the decision that they made that the mdc is the government they would want to be in place needs to be respected in any negotiation process
870634 the fact that the sadc southern african development community and the au african union are monitoring the peace process does not give zimbabweans confidence based on the fact that the two bodies have had their credibility eroded to a large extent the aus acceptance of robert mugabe to go to the au summit after the african union and pan african parliament and sadc had all declared that the election in june were not an expression of the free will of the people of zimbabwe was an indictment on the au it was a sign that the au body is complicit with mugabe in terms of subverting the will of the people of zimbabwe
870635 so there is some hesitance on the part of zimbabweans to say there is no guarantee that the au will protect their vote more importantly that it was exacerbated by the resolutions that came out advocating for a government of national unity

870746 the dr said you did a good job with the bandages
870747 ah esse texto aqui deus falou ah mas este outro aqui n o
870748 porque a profecia nunca foi produzida por vontade dos homens mas os homens da parte de deus falaram movidos pelo esp rito santo
870749 l mpada para os meus p s a tua palavra e luz para o meu caminho
870750 toda escritura divinamente inspirada e proveitosa para ensinar para repreender para corrigir para instruir em justi a
870751 porquanto tudo que dantes foi escrito para nosso ensino foi escrito para que pela const ncia e pela consola o provenientes das escrituras tenhamos esperan a
870752 seca se a erva e murcha a flor mas a palavra de nosso deus subsiste eternamente
870753 e o ter consigo e nele ler todos os dias da sua vida para que aprenda a temer ao senhor seu deus e a guardar todas as palavras desta lei e estes estatutos a fim de os cumprir
870754 examinais as escrituras porque julgais ter nelas a vida eterna e s o elas que d o testemunho de mim
870755 acharam se as tuas palavras e eu as comi e as tuas palavras eram para mim o gozo e alegria do meu cora o pois levo o teu nome senhor deus dos ex rcitos
870756 bem aventurado aquele que l e bem aventurados os que ouvem as palavras desta profecia e guardam as coisas que nela est o escritas porque o tempo est pr ximo
870757 voc n o vai conseguir este emprego n o adianta nem tentar

870761 aguardando a bem aventurada esperan a e o aparecimento da gl ria do nosso grande deus e salvador cristo jesus
870762 ent o aparecer no c u o sinal do filho do homem e todas as tribos da terra se lamentar o e ver o vir o filho do homem sobre as nuvens do c u com poder e grande gl ria quando pois vier o filho do homem na sua gl ria e todos os anjos com ele ent o se assentar no trono da sua gl ria e diante dele ser o reunidas todas as na es e ele separar uns dos outros como o pastor separa as ovelhas dos cabritos
870763 eis que vem com as nuvens e todo olho o ver at mesmo aqueles que o traspassaram e todas as tribos da terra se lamentar o sobre ele sim am m
870764 porque o filho do homem h de vir na gl ria de seu pai com os seus anjos e ent o retribuir a cada um segundo as suas obras
870765 porque o senhor mesmo descer do c u com grande brado voz do arcanjo ao som da trombeta de deus e os que morreram em cristo ressuscitar o primeiro
870766 depois n s os que ficarmos vivos seremos arrebatados juntamente com eles nas nuvens ao encontro do senhor nos ares e assim estaremos para sempre com o senhor

870770 todo aquele que vive habitualmente no pecado tamb m vive na rebeldia pois o pecado rebeldia
870771 de modo que a lei se tornou nosso aio para nos conduzir a cristo a fim de que pela f f ssemos justificados
870772 se guardardes os meus mandamentos permanecereis no meu amor do mesmo modo que eu tenho guardado os mandamentos de meu pai e permane o no seu amor
870773 n o penseis que vim destruir a lei ou os profetas n o vim destruir mas cumprir porque em verdade vos digo que at que o c u e a terra passem de modo nenhum passar da lei um s i ou um s til at que tudo seja cumprido
870774 eu sei que tudo quanto deus faz durar eternamente nada se lhe pode acrescentar e nada se lhe pode tirar e isso deus faz para que os homens temam diante dele
870775 assim observarei de cont nuo a tua lei para sempre e eternamente

870778 daquele dia e hora por m ningu m sabe nem os anjos do c u nem o filho sen o s o pai
870779 mas irm os acerca dos tempos e das pocas n o necessitais de que se vos escreva porque v s mesmos sabeis perfeitamente que o dia do senhor vir como vem o ladr o de noite pois quando estiverem dizendo paz e seguran a ent o lhes sobrevir repentina destrui o como as dores de parto quela que est gr vida e de modo nenhum escapar o mas v s irm os n o estais em trevas para que aquele dia como ladr o vos surpreenda
870780 e ouvireis falar de guerras e rumores de guerras olhai n o vos perturbeis porque for oso que assim aconte a mas ainda n o o fim porquanto se levantar na o contra na o e reino contra reino e haver fomes e terremotos em v rios lugares
870781 eia agora v s ricos chorai e pranteai por causa das desgra as que vos sobrevir o as vossas riquezas est o apodrecidas e as vossas vestes est o ro das pela tra a o vosso ouro e a vossa prata est o enferrujados e a sua ferrugem dar testemunho contra v s e devorar as vossas carnes como fogo entesourastes para os ltimos dias eis que o sal rio que fraudulentamente retivestes aos trabalhadores que ceifaram os vossos campos clama e os clamores dos ceifeiros t m chegado aos ouvidos do senhor dos ex rcitos
870782 sabe por m isto que nos ltimos dias sobrevir o tempos penosos pois os homens ser o amantes de si mesmos gananciosos presun osos soberbos blasfemos desobedientes a seus pais ingratos mpios sem afei o natural implac veis caluniadores incontinentes cru is inimigos do bem traidores atrevidos orgulhosos mais amigos dos deleites do que amigos de deus tendo apar ncia de piedade mas negando lhe o poder afasta te tamb m desses
870783 tu por m daniel cerra as palavras e sela o livro at o fim do tempo muitos correr o de uma parte para outra e a ci ncia se multiplicar
870784 logo depois da tribula o daqueles dias escurecer o sol e a lua n o dar a sua luz as estrelas cair o do c u e os poderes dos c us ser o abalados
870785 ora quando essas coisas come arem a acontecer exultai e levantai as vossas cabe as porque a vossa reden o se aproxima prop s lhes ent o uma par bola olhai para a figueira e para todas as rvores quando come am a brotar sabeis por v s mesmos ao v las que j est pr ximo o ver o assim tamb m v s quando virdes acontecerem estas coisas sabei que o reino de deus est pr ximo
870786 vigiai pois porque n o sabeis em que dia vem o vosso senhor por isso ficai tamb m v s apercebidos porque numa hora em que n o penseis vir o filho do homem
870787 portanto assim como por um s homem entrou o pecado no mundo e pelo pecado a morte assim tamb m a morte passou a todos os homens porquanto todos pecaram
870788 pelo que ainda que te laves com salitre e uses muito sab o a mancha da tua iniq idade est diante de mim diz o senhor deus
870789 porque deus amou o mundo de tal maneira que deu o seu filho unig nito para que todo aquele que nele cr n o pere a mas tenha a vida eterna
870790 porque o filho do homem veio buscar e salvar o que se havia perdido
870791 porque n o temos um sumo sacerdote que n o possa compadecer se das nossas fraquezas por m um que como n s em tudo foi tentado mas sem pecado
870792 era desprezado e rejeitado dos homens homem de dores e experimentado nos sofrimentos e como um de quem os homens escondiam o rosto era desprezado e n o fizemos dele caso algum verdadeiramente ele tomou sobre si as nossas enfermidades e carregou com as nossas dores e n s o reput vamos por aflito ferido de deus e oprimido mas ele foi ferido por causa das nossas transgress es e esmagado por causa das nossas iniq idades o castigo que nos traz a paz estava sobre ele e pelas suas pisaduras fomos sarados todos n s and vamos desgarrados como ovelhas cada um se desviava pelo seu caminho mas o senhor fez cair sobre ele a iniq idade de todos n s
870793 mas na realidade cristo foi ressuscitado dentre os mortos sendo ele as prim cias dos que dormem porque assim como por um homem veio a morte tamb m por um homem veio a ressurrei o dos mortos pois como em ad o todos morrem do mesmo modo em cristo todos ser o vivificados
870794 e em nenhum outro h salva o porque debaixo do c u nenhum outro nome h dado entre os homens em que devamos ser salvos
870795 eis que estou porta e bato se algu m ouvir a minha voz e abrir a porta entrarei em sua casa e com ele cearei e ele comigo
870796 n o havia um desenho qual era a cor das letras isso pode ajudar nem ao menos uma palavra
870797 levando ele mesmo os nossos pecados em seu corpo sobre o madeiro para que mortos para os pecados pud ssemos viver para a justi a e pelas suas feridas fostes sarados
870798 sendo justificados gratuitamente pela sua gra a mediante a reden o que h em cristo jesus
870799 se confessarmos os nossos pecados ele fiel e justo para nos perdoar os pecados e nos purificar de toda injusti a
870800 pedro ent o lhes respondeu arrependei vos e cada um de v s seja batizado em nome de jesus cristo para remiss o de vossos pecados e recebereis o dom do esp rito santo
870801 confessei te o meu pecado e a minha iniq idade n o encobri disse eu confessarei ao senhor as minhas transgress es e tu perdoaste a culpa do meu pecado
870802 vinde pois e arrazoemos diz o senhor ainda que os vossos pecados s o como a escarlata eles se tornar o brancos como a neve ainda que s o vermelhos como o carmesim tornar se o como a l
870803 eu eu mesmo sou o que apago as tuas transgress es por amor de mim e dos teus pecados n o me lembro
870804 arrependei vos pois e convertei vos para que sejam apagados os vossos pecados de sorte que venham os tempos de refrig rio da presen a do senhor
870805 se confessarmos os nossos pecados ele fiel e justo para nos perdoar os pecados e nos purificar de toda injusti a
870806 ent o aspergirei gua pura sobre v s e ficareis purificados de todas as vossas imund cias e de todos os vossos dolos vos purificarei tamb m vos darei um cora o novo e porei dentro de v s um esp rito novo e tirarei da vossa carne o cora o de pedra e vos darei um cora o de carne ainda porei dentro de v s o meu esp rito e farei que andeis nos meus estatutos e guardeis as minhas ordenan as e as observeis

871042 i wanted to run faster so i pushed the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor it worked for a while and then it crashed and now it wont start

871046 thanks for buying our car how can i help you
871047 im not a technical person i just want to go places in my car
871048 martha soon we will be married 50 years and theres something i have to know in all of these 50 years have you ever been unfaithful to me
871049 well henry i have to be honest with you yes ive been unfaithful to you three times during these 50 years but always for a good reason
871050 the first time was shortly after we were married and we were about to lose our little house because we couldnt pay the mortgage do you remember that one evening i went to see the banker and the next day he notified you that the loan would be extended
871051 i can forgive you for that you saved our home but what about the second time
871052 and do you remember when you were so sick but we didnt have the money to pay for the heart surgery you needed well i went to see your doctor one night and if you recall he did the surgery at no charge
871053 and you did it to save my life so i of course i can forgive you for that now tell me about the third time
871054 so do you remember when you ran for president of the yacht club and you needed 73 more votes
871055 behold i am coming soon my reward is with me and i will give to everyone according to what he has done
871056 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing
871057 its a tough road but i think georgia has as good or better shot than anybody else in the top 10 the only wild card is how incredibly competitive the sec has become the key to us doing well assuming the bulldogs play up to their potential on paper as it was last year and years previous you have to beat florida in jacksonville that historically has been the make or break game
871058 while we were waiting on the side of the road the attacker was taunting the police with the head in his hand
871059 if the city can convince my members of the dire necessity of such a move the membership would be willing to listen
871060 theyd be willing to consider anything the city can convince them is necessary
871061 which is certainly going to be a damn cold day in hell before that happens
871062 judging from the reaction here and elsewhere its already been considered and rejected by the members
871063 theyve stacked their payrolls with top washington power brokers of all political stripes including republican john mccains presidential campaign manager rick davis democrat barack obamas original vice presidential vetter jim johnson and scores of others now working for the two rivals for the white house
871064 in washington fannie and freddies sprawling lobbying machine hired family and friends of politicians in their efforts to quickly sideline any regulations that might slow their growth or invite greater oversight of their business practices indeed their rapid expansion was at least in part the result of such artful lobbying over the years
871065 it will be somewhere between 600 000 and 750 000 with about a third of it going directly to the bush library
871066 hayden grab your towel we are going to the pool
871067 i had learned what we all learned over there every man has his breaking point i had reached mine
871068 cia director michael hayden banned waterboarding in 2006 but government officials have said it remains a possibility if approved by the attorney general the cia chief and the president
871069 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
871070 for the first time in its history the united states sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment u s held detainees making torture the official law of the land in all but name
871071 the bush administrations extralegal counterterrorism program presented the most dramatic sustained and radical challenge to the rule of law in american history
871072 no position taken had done more damage to the american reputation in the world ever
871073 i dont know of any acts of torture that have been committed by individuals in developing information
871074 so i would not certainly make an assumption i would attribute the absence of an attack since 9 11 at least in part because there have been specific attacks that have been disrupted to the excellent work and the dedication and commitment of people whose lives are dedicated to defending the country interrogators have used enhanced interrogation techniques but they havent used torture
871075 an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering
871076 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture we have further found that if a defendant acts with the good faith belief that his actions will not cause such suffering he has not acted with specific intent
871077 imagine that in an ordinary criminal prosecution a bank robber tortures a bank manager to get the combination to a vault he argues that the torture was not to inflict pain but to get the combination every torturer has a reason other than to cause pain if youre going to let people off the hook for an intention other than to cause pain youre not going to be able to prosecute anyone for torture
871078 as of 2006 there had been more than 330 cases in which u s military and civilian personnel have incredibly alleged to have abused or killed detainees this figure is based almost entirely on the u s governments own documentation these cases involved more than 600 u s personnel and more than 460 detainees held at u s facilities throughout afghanistan iraq and guantanamo bay they included some l00 plus detainees who died in u s custody including 34 whose deaths the defense department reports as homicides at least eight of these detainees were by any definition of the term tortured to death
871079 because the u s failed to offer adequate assurances against inhumane treatment
871080 the uk can no longer rely on u s assurances that it does not use torture and we recommend that the government does not rely on such assurances in the future
871081 the interests of justice are not served by admitting these statements
871082 because of the highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
871083 each time an avid lender struck a deal with an avid borrower
871084 it reinforced a new definition of acceptable behavior for neighbors family and friends in a community behavior sets off ripples every decision is a public contribution or a destructive act
871085 i always had that dream to go back and help my people someday and they will never really get away in mind
871086 when i saw my dad and came back i was confident it was doable
871087 the most insulting small minded trash ive ever read in a newspaper
871088 what a sobering sight that was at the recent lynyrd skynyrd concert at the shell a graying couple she in big jeans that were still a size too small he a skinny willie nelson type hand on her derriere swaying to the music like a couple of sleepy cobras just where did they think they were back in 1972
871089 look you cant see the stage that well anyway without binoculars your hearing isnt what it used to be youre really not up for dancing but theyll still let you into the shell just ask for the special new boomer seating up front but off to the side near the restrooms and hearing aid rental booth

871131 there are concerns the economy may be slowing faster than expected senior analyst lee wai tuck said from singapore
871132 the economy may slow we dont use the word recession the economy may slow too quickly
871133 it now is obvious to almost everyone that extremely tight financial conditions are bringing the australian economy to a screeching halt he said
871134 as i said to the treasurer wayne swan i dont think his outrage is going to do too much good he said
871135 the best way to do it reduce bank lending rates is through the reserve bank because the reserve bank is in a position to see the balance sheets of the banks and the treasurer isnt
871136 in conjunction with other economic data released in recent months the job advertisements series provides further evidence that the current level of interest rates is achieving the rbas desired slowing in domestic economic growth he said
871137 there will be scope for the reserve bank to take its foot off the brake he said
871138 again and again some people in the crowd wake up they have no ground in the crowd they emerge according to much broader laws and carry strange customs with them and demand room for bold gestures the future speaks ruthlessly through them

871141 we live in an age of prophecy during which humanity has the opportunity to re awaken to timeless inter dependent relationship with the cosmos without a doubt we are here at this special time to help fulfill an awesome and delicately orchestrated plan to align earth with the cosmos and humanity with the universal heart we are here to awaken to the full potential of being authentic aware human beings its time to drop your cosmic remote control get out of that visualization chair and get to work spirit helps those who help themselves spirit works right now not yesterday not tomorrow quit watching what is going on and take action use your power to do something about the imbalances in your world
871142 ones mind once stretched by a new idea never regains its original dimensions

871158 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
871159 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
871160 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
871161 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
871162 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
871163 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
871164 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
871165 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
871166 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
871167 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
871168 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
871169 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
871170 its a novel approach which in my experience helps couples achieve greater intimacy so why not
871171 this report shows that more than 50 per cent of existing teachers would meet those accomplished standards
871172 what we require now is a commitment on the part of government with additional targeted funding to progress this proposition
871173 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
871174 i am concerned that the aeus proposal would mean that more than half of the nations teachers would qualify for this professional pay
871175 performance pay should be for those who actually perform at the highest level and should be something teachers strive towards it shouldnt be easy for anyone and everyone to qualify
871176 the ieua looks forward to working with our colleagues in the government school sector to achieve these agreed outcomes
871177 jeffs a leader to all the aboriginal boys at the club and also to a lot of younger guys

871184 there are no property developments in the portfolio and all the buildings over which mortgages are held are established and well tenanted there are no related party loans
871185 the reality is that this is a solid investment which has delivered attractive consistent returns
871186 the fund is performing well however we cannot ignore the market sentiment and the impact this is having on investor confidence
871187 we are hopeful investors and their advisers will clearly consider the nature and benefit of good quality mortgage assets when making investment decisions in the current environment

871194 if i go tonight ive had a hell of a life
871195 in essence youre saying goodbye to people who youve been part of their life for a long time
871196 when i got up that morning i heard the babies crying and i looked down and i saw looked like two white pieces of paper laying in the exhibit no camouflage at all
871197 they were just strung out through the whole exhibit i locked the big cats down when i got em they were about half frozen to death so we brought em to the house put em in warm water brought their body temperature back up

871201 i will work on eliminating passive voice from my writing
871202 if you aim for nothing you will certainly attain it

871205 we need to test and improve the product before deployment were not buying a product but a technology its going to take a while for the technology to have an impact on the bottomline and topline
871206 when we talk to the operators at the ceo cmo level ive not had a single customer talk to me about price the only thing they talk to me about is how many more products have developed and what can we launch and what can we do in terms of tweaks and micro marketing tactics feature changes to increase revenues this is not a cost game right now so were not likely to be squeezed on price
871207 we have to launch new products every six months thats the mandate of the product teams
871208 tariff re balancing instead of rs 6 min there are calls at rs 1 2 min but these are supplemented with subscription packs of rs 30 50 per month

871223 for these and similar reasons forsooth the ancients insist that the earth remains at rest in the middle of the universe and that this is its status beyond any doubt yet if anyone believes that the earth rotates surely he will hold that its motion is natural not violent but what is in accordance with nature produces effects contrary to those resulting from violence since things to which force or violence is applied must disintegrate and cannot long endure on the other hand that which is brought into existence by nature is well ordered and preserved in its best state ptolemy has no cause then to fear that the earth and everything earthly will be disrupted by a rotation created through natures handiwork which is quite different from what art or human intelligence can accomplish

871239 far from being a society in the advanced stages of recovery from our terrible history south africa is a gigantic psychiatric unit with so many of us whites as well as blacks failing to acknowledge let alone wrestle with our wounded psyches we are not so much a nation in decline following great expectations but a traumatised people hovering between depression and delusion

871241 surely the most obdurately gormless president in the history of the anc youth league young julius continues to astound with his stubborn resistance to reason

871246 i think donald dropped to the ground on purpose on that one
871247 i had good lean on it and he just fell and the ref threw it it was like michael jordan against allen iverson first coming in
871248 i really thought they flew to the ball it looked to me from not studying it it looked like they did a good job with the bump at the line of scrimmage disrupting the routes i thought the defense had a very good night
871249 im happy about the contract glad we got it done the fact that i can just back on the field and be around the guys and really move forward to help this team win i was excited about that
871250 of course you cant simulate playing in pads and everything like that so i think that will take a little bit of time i take real pride in the conditioning part of what i do and i think the training staff theyll tell you what kind of shape i came in
871251 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people will give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
871252 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down communicate there are some things that we need to go through and then once again information that comes out of that conversation will be used to move forward in the decision well make for our football team thats where we are
871253 there are some things where the production wasnt there whether it was on the front end or the back end of the pass play
871254 im just playing football out there tonight we didnt throw and catch it as well as i would have liked to but its a growing process were going to try to peak at the right time when we play minnesota
871255 i think the organization has been put in a tough spot
871256 its a difficult situation when he decided to change his mind but were going to welcome him back and move forward as a team
871257 with him coming back and if they do open it up to competition then i get a chance to compete and thats all i can ask for
871258 mrs joness insurer will only cover ventolin hfa or proair hfa but youve written proventil hfa can we switch
871259 rapid heart beat vomiting chest pain and palpitation occurs more frequently with proventil hfa than with cfc albuterol
871260 so despite the damage the freon in the generic inhalers do to the ozone layer 74 million inhalers last year
871261 sep 18 2007 mediterranean diet halves risk of progressive lung disease a large
871262 there is no freon in cfc mdis freon is cfc 113 it is not used in inhalers cfc 11 12 are used in mdis
871263 i recently requested and had a conversation with the inventor of the hfa 134a propellant and also proventil hfa and he told me straight up that he likes proventil hfa better due to some of the valving issues however he feels that schering plough is raping the population by selling this 10 year old drug at the highest retail price of any albuterol on the market
871264 rapid heart beat vomiting chest pain and palpitation occurs more frequently with proventil hfa than with cfc albuterol
871265 such as the hfa inhalers many pulmonary patients are now suffering with and in some cases undoubtedly dying from and b as fda whistleblower dr
871266 the classic approach of industry and fda has been to do studies that are too small to conclusively identify that a risk is real
871267 there is nothing worse or more unethical than someone who cannot discuss the disease state trying to prove a medical point through anecdotal evidence
871268 the gas hfa 134a has over 25 years in human testing with thousands of patients across the world
871269 my debate with arthur has to do with his lack of knowledge of the history of hfa as well as the vast majority of people who use it daily and never have an issue vs his message of doom and gloom and you are all going to die yes an exageration of his point but none the less if you use hfa which is just a false statement
871270 additionally he would rather patients be afraid of their rescue medicine and not take it but sign up for his petition even though it is a decided issue already and he has to have the knowledge that the change has already occured in regards to these inhalers
871271 so the change is coming doctors have no say in it blame president clinton for ratifying the montreol protocol treaty in 96 that is what is forcing the change over and more expensive drugs
871272 the overall incidence of adverse events was comparable between both groups
871273 in addition the incidence of respiratory side effects was also similar
871274 the safety profile of the hfa formulation was comparable to those of the marketed cfc mdis used in germany and france italy
871275 no clinically significant differences were detected between hfa134a or cfc driven inhalers on the switch from cfc to hfa mdi 2 weeks before randomisation versus 2 weeks after randomization
871276 in conclusion administration of a fenoterol ipratropium bromide combination via hydrofluoroalkane metered dose inhaler is as safe as delivery by the currently available chlorofluorocarbon metered dose inhaler in an extended population of patients with cao under normal prescribing conditions
871277 rapid heart beat vomiting chest pain and palpitation occurs more frequently with proventil hfa than with cfc albuterol
871278 the classic approach of industry and fda has been to do studies that are too small to conclusively identify that a risk is real
871279 i dont trust my doctor he tried to get me to use a more expensive medicine that he said would better treat my asthma he actually wanted me to believe that my asthma can change over time
871280 why not provide the patients with fair data like the percentage of patients on cfc that suffered from paradoxical bronchospasms due to the cold puff that get great relief from hfa or what about those asthmatics that got less than 50 of their targeted dose of medicine from cfc inhalers when the ambient temperature dropped below freezing for those of you who live in the north and keep their inhalers in their car or who are active outdoors in the winter or what about the patients who cut their medicine bill by 50 by useing hfa versions of steroid inhalers and are able to get off of expensive combo therapies and maintain their quality of life
871281 once again let me reinforce that you are singling out proventil hfa and other rescue medicine
871282 you need to expand your research to the approval trials for the hfa gas which is the data you

871305 since the charge against the ars was nonsensical though possessed of a certain vague if irrational social plausibility in the light of the lex iulia and augustan moral reforms in general ovid as i good rhetorician could safely be left to refute it at eye catching length and in loudly self exculpatory tones while exercising discretion over his less easily justifiable brush with dynastic power politics this explains why he was not only allowed but encouraged to correspond freely with friends in rome ep 3 6 11 12 and to publish his exilic poems the literary praeceptor amoris found himself in the end treated as a mere political pawn
871306 i have two serious strikes against me i am an historian which means that i believe in the objective existence of truth and have no great faith in the binding force of critical theory and not only do i passionately love literature but i never forget it was written for real people in an actual society at a specific point in time
871307 no book was so bad but some good might be got out of it
871308 i think when youre choosing a director because its all about choices just the sheer physical task of it which is a grind and you want to make sure they have a physical but you want to know the choices and the intelligence behind it is one you want to work with because theres a million choices along the way if its not all of a piece if its not all the same sensibility and taste then the picture doesnt know what it is kind of movie what i thought was if we make a good one of those i think therell be an audience for it
871309 when we were doing waynes world literally we were writing it the night before wed be writing scenes in my office at paramount we were shooting on the lot so it was okay that and thats the way we were used to it at the show i think in this one because its so much more elaborate stunts and physical comedy i think there was a lot more planning to do things
871310 i was there i think three times i sort of keep an eye on it being a producer on a movie set is watching paint dry its just really good for morale you want to show people that youre engaged but if youve done your work properly and the script is right and the cast is right and the director knows what hes doing then i think its a straight supporting role and you come back into it in post i mean it has to stay on schedule and those kinds of things
871311 it was not as hard with the studio as it should have been because its a first time director and a first time movie star and its an expensive movie in the sense that its got stunts and as movie goes its not expensive but in that world its expensive and they said well if thats what you want to do and so pulling the cast together and we got lucky on a lot of things and then the experience of making it was just great we were in vancouver and you know the team on the picture aside from the people we brought were like nick powell who was the stunt coordinator whos done gladiator and bourne identity so we have that and andrew dunn whos the cinematographer it was like the a team so if akiva said how do we do this there was a really interesting solution to things and it was all in service of what is essentially a big dumb comedy

871324 many semi popular accounts of cosmology contain statements to the effect that space itself is swelling up in causing the galaxies to separate this seems to imply that all objects are being stretched by some mysterious force are we to infer that humans who survived for a hubble time would find themselves to be roughly four meters tall certainly not apart from anything else this would be a profoundly anti relativistic notion since relativity teaches us that properties of objects in local inertial frames are independent of the global properties of spacetime
871325 in fact nothing happens and nothing occurs till the very end
871326 any attempt to determine whether galaxies are moving through static space or are carried away by the expansion of space are doomed to failure

871336 when youre a teenager you just take everything in you absorb all these ideas
871337 it just opened my mind not only to new ideas but just that theres a bigger world out there and that i can do anything i want and so when i got home i was like im going to be a filmmaker thats when i decided when i was about 17 and i stuck to my guns
871338 theyre revealing themselves in a way that could follow them for the rest of their lives
871339 i felt the weight of that responsibility when i was making it
871340 i knew i wanted it to be a town that had only one high school
871341 and i wanted it to be economically mixed and i was hoping for it to be racially mixed but that was hard to find in the midwest in small towns
871342 much more than my film and theres much more of an emphasis on wealth and competition
871343 more stagy we want to control everything in america its unfortunate
871344 i think theres something mean spirited about a lot of them too theyre appealing to the basest part of ourselves weve become bottom feeders
871345 i think that because this film is about teenagers there is a natural assumption that its influenced by reality tv because there is so much reality tv about teenagers
871346 but a lot of reality tv got their cues from documentaries and now documentaries are being criticized for learning things from reality tv funny
871347 there were parallel story lines a bit more like you have in
871348 so it was written like that but in the editing process my editor and i realized it wasnt working that left us in a kind of crisis especially me because everybody really liked the script everybody loved the script and i remember going into the shoot with a huge attitude like i knew i had the cast and i knew i had the script and i felt like nothing could go wrong and then it was like waking up we saw the first rough cut and discovered that it didnt work at all
871349 i tell you man people dont doubt you anymore but you cant believe the hype dont believe the hype thats very important

871355 four boys in a repressive environment who find freedom through this play
871356 students 1 2 3 and 4 are characters outside of the shakespearean characters
871357 its their story i get a buzz when i see what happens when you look at things through a different lens
871358 it needs muscularity a pack of teenage boys generates an energy violence is always possible something happens with an all male environment there is a kind of mob mentality a different energy when there are no women around
871359 forget about gender and sexuality its much more exciting if the characters are swept into something monumental and dangerous that was not in their minds to have the play itself push them to emotional abandon
871360 my job as a director is to cast well and then to paraphrase british director richard eyre give the actors a comfortable loving environment and ask them to soar
871361 what saddens me the most about our society is that for boys any behavior that shows intimacy is labeled and shamed dont cry dont be a sissy while girls are allowed to have best friends have sleepovers hold hands r amp j addresses that

871427 they key to a tournament like this is making it through those first two days
871428 if you can make it to the ladder and be one of those 64 players that move on to wednesday anything is possible
871429 you need to stay calm and realize that youre in the tournament rather than just watching it theres always the possibility that you can really light it up especially with match play
871430 the fact that i made it through qualifying and i get to play is just amazing
871431 now that im in it i dont want to stress out but just stay focused and play well
871432 it will be great working with my dad and having my family there
871433 were so close and hes done so much to help me out its really neat to get to share something like this with him
871434 its rare for us to sign up to a project based on just a proposal but the opportunity to work with proven talent like pat and clint from such an early stage on a project with so much potential was just too good to pass up
871435 holy shit its a symbiote infected wolverine youre up against
871436 were going to explore the background of the fallen the main villain of the movie as well as expand on the reign of starscream story that were doing and tie everything in to what this next movie is going to be the next movie starts out with just tons of action and theres obviously going to be a lot of questions so were hoping to answer some of those beforehand
871437 reign of starscream starts right at the very end of that big last action sequence in mission city
871438 if i could get all the information thats stored within frenzys body i might be able to rebuild the all spark back on cybertron and therefore everyone will think im this great leader
871439 were definitely taking every character that we can from the sequel
871440 so youll see some sector 7 involvement and how they developed into a new group that will be introduced
871441 hes more of like a military guy so in destiny were going to see a lot more involvement with the backgrounds of prime and megatron as well as cybertrons history and how that affects the present day it all centers around the plot of the sequel which i obviously cant get into itll be explained but youll see a lot more expansion of their characters and their motivations and their destinies if you will
871442 one of the toughest things with stories involving time travel
871443 is that no matter what you do theres always some sort of paradox i get to play in my own sandbox with a lot of new characters who wont be in the movie
871444 in the film john is straddling the line between being a soldier in the resistance to becoming the leader hes been told he has to be
871445 hes struggling with the responsibility does he want it in the comic hes still just a soldier taking orders as opposed to giving them but his persona and actions are starting to have a strong effect on the people around him

871451 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
871452 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
871453 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
871454 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops

871472 theyre stuck in tijuana with no job no home no resources they end up turning to a life of crime and if they are selling their body or addicted to drugs theyre tempted to have unprotected sex for more money
871473 he has been on the other side of the needle
871474 i know its difficult but its not impossible i know you have moments of desperation
871475 one user will share a needle with 50 others if he has to

871487 nuestros objetivos son los mismos queremos dejar de lado eso de las pel culas de superh roes siempre tienen que queremos re formular lo que nos funcion la ltima vez y hacerla evolucionar al fin y al cabo es un hombre que es puesto en una circunstancia extraordinaria y junto con toda la gente que lo rodea crea una familia me gusta la idea de iron man 2 y creo que podr n entender todos los puntos de vista que contiene podr n tocar estos temas que son mucho m s dif ciles de entender pero a la ves seguir con el entretenimiento

871489 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
871490 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
871491 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
871492 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion nine nine percent of the time it works out for us
871493 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
871494 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
871495 if it keeps raining we win it didnt and we got seventh
871496 it was a crazy ballgame but it was a big win

871500 where if my car and my house hadnt been tampered with and i hadnt gotten a threatening phone call and id been able to do my work that was a good day
871501 felt like the one thing i could do that had any possibility of minimizing the danger
871502 theres no way they could be sisters and exchange clothes
871503 a chunky necklace needs a confident woman to carry it off
871504 to me pearls are step 1 on what to wear if you want to become a first lady
871505 both michelle and cindy are channeling jackie o they wear streamlined clothing with pearls
871506 weve seen so much statement jewelry bigger necklaces bigger bracelets bigger earrings and it always trickles down to all price points
871507 you use accessories to make your wardrobe more exciting if youre not buying new clothes then youre investing in new jewelry even if its costume jewelry
871508 you can look severe and bare if youre not wearing a necklace which makes you look feminine and elegant
871509 a necklace should fit into the neckline of the dress the green with the mixed pearls looked good but the neckline is too high and theres too much detail around it
871510 some women default to pearls when they dont know what else to do i dont think thats happening with her shes using the necklace to complete an outfit and give insight into her personality
871511 im not sure if pearls are the best choice because i dont think of her as being traditional
871512 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents
871513 the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
871514 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds
871515 although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
871516 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
871517 the landscape scale ecology of pollinators and pollination mechanisms patterns and processes
871518 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
871519 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
871520 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
871521 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
871522 its not just matrix of natural areas with agriculture mixed in but a patchwork quilt with animals using all of the areas in the landscape
871523 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
871524 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
871525 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
871526 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
871527 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia

871542 now im no psychiatrist far from it but i think a simple answer is that senator clinton could be depressed
871543 maybe hillarys taking meds but theyre just not working for her could that be why shes always attacking big pharma
871544 weve had experienced hillary soft hillary hard hillary misty hillary sarcastic hillary joined at the hip to bill hillary her own person who just happens to be married to a former president hillary hillary cuddly hillary hillary just as in the white house when her cascading images and hairstyles became dizzying and unsettling suggesting that the first lady woke up every day struggling to create a persona now she seems to think there is a political solution to her problem
871545 i mean most people have mood swings and attitude swings which i have to say in my case change radically time to time but to go from basically applauding him sen barack obama as a human being to saying he ought to be ashamed of himself is a wicked turn of tone i think but you say what you think
871546 w e are talking about a clinical condition that could make her clinton dangerously ill suited to become president and commander in chief
871547 that if he is already on medication his doctors need to adjust it or change it entirely

871585 there is going to be a vote september 30 will not come and go without a vote on the opening the outer continental shelf the message has been delivered the issue cant be ignored any longer
871586 bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full fair debate consisting of full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives

871588 this is an economy where people are on edge about things like downsizing and getting laid off and heres a guy who has wielded that knife
871589 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
871590 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
871591 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering

871597 my life as a high beta stock or actually thats the good side of my face
871598 as i recall we picked this particular variety because when it flowers it will be quite pretty it will be either pink or purple
871599 nothing is prettier than taking a ride down church street in the summertime when all the trees are in bloom
871600 i think its great that were planting trees to reap the benefits for the environment and controlled planting so that we can plan the species and the location
871601 the wetlands area is such a unique area for us to focus things like this memorial area down there is one more attraction to the wetlands
871602 at over 70 mph there was just so much spray
871603 its really hard to remember a time in my life when they werent there to call them best friends is an understatement i considered them my sisters i wanted to give back and i wanted to do something i think this is something to fill the hole in my heart
871604 i came home from school and just started mentioning the idea to my friends
871605 were hoping that everyone will stay and enjoy a night in the village
871606 i want to bring the community together and i want to keep the spirit of the girls alive im hoping the walk will be uplifting and something everyone can look forward to every year
871607 several months ago i was approached by meryl scheible a friend of the five girls
871608 i was really impressed with her organization and desire to plan this event hopefully the walk is a way to celebrate the lives of the five girls last years tragedy touched the hearts of the entire community if our organization can help in any way we are proud to do so
871609 i just think its a fantastic memory to keep going
871610 i think this is something that nobody will ever forget and i think its great that people are supporting the scholarships in the names of these five angels
871611 she was one of a kind level headed and mature for her age she always thought she could have gone to college a year earlier because she felt she was ready
871612 although she had lower back problems it didnt stop her from tumbling even though it required frequent visits to the chiropractor
871613 she would get excited about winning designer clothes or shoes on ebay and i told her to please stop winning
871614 i looked up to her and would ask her advice about stuff
871615 she loved to ride the bus and be at all the games
871616 when we couldnt make the away games she would call us and keep us posted on the score
871617 we had a whole spreadsheet of graduation parties to attend
871618 she and her friends just went from party to party they were really looking forward to a summer of laying out in the sun and swimming
871619 she had met friends and couldnt wait to get there she was ready to go
871620 shes just one of those people who really sticks out in your mind
871621 so when she graduated last week i tried at graduation to say something personal to each kid as they crossed the stage and i just simply said to meredith as i handed her her diploma
871622 it was a vote of the family but neighborhood solicitation of names
871623 she looked at her mom and said just get more pipes
871624 and i guess i vastly underestimated this young lady in terms of the effect she had on many many others and i dont think i gave her enough credit
871625 she was really caring and i really loved her a lot
871626 now im starting to see why she did those things
871627 we feel those thoughts and prayers every day and thats how we go on with our lives it seems everybody knew at least one of the girls
871628 i think that they continue to touch so many peoples lives even a year later
871629 this has been the most painful year of our lives and will continue to be
871630 people say time heals but the pain and the loss seem to grow but i do want to say the thing that gets us through the day is our family and friends new and old
871631 the phone calls the e mails and the hugs mean so much to us
871632 we love people who loved katie we just miss her
871633 we are moving forward with our lives and would like to thank everyone for all the positive thoughts and support
871634 thank you friends we could not have made it without you every time i see an angel ribbon magnet on a car i feel like i have a received a hug
871635 our home and family life is a constant reminder that meredith is missing from our presence we do realize these special dates the anniversary holidays are times when others are more conscious of our loss and at that point we are drawn close by others
871636 i think we are at the point now where we are just starting to grieve i think were all feeling like this is forever now i think i speak for everybody when i say the grief will never go away every day theyre in our hearts and in our minds the community all of the friends and the community have just been wonderful theyre still supporting the families these girls will just never be forgotten
871637 she was good with words she was a really good communicator both written and verbal she was creative
871638 bailey was eagerly looking forward to beginning her future at ithaca college often discussing with us how she planned to be successful at school yet keep her life in balance
871639 personally thats one of the things i like the most about bailey
871640 she was doing a joint graduation party with her cheerleader friend missy cameron
871641 the word boring and bailey would never be used in the same sentence because she just had so much zip
871642 bailey was a driving force in our life she was constantly on the go arranging activities with friends yet conscientiously attending to her responsibilities at school her team and volunteer work
871643 she had so much energy she always had some little adventure planned
871644 i told her do not forget to put on your shoes
871645 in those days baileys greatest joy in life was to go to skate works and pick out her competition outfit and her competition music
871646 it brought her out of her shell and gave her confidence
871647 bailey was a joyful blend of irreverence humor generosity intelligence honesty and loyalty
871648 she always wanted to be surrounded by people all the time
871649 wed wake up in the middle of the night wed walk out at 3 oclock in the morning and katies sitting in the office cutting paper pasting trimming photos
871650 she would sit up all night and make a scrapbook so she could give it to someone at school the next day
871651 then when she got older she manufactured this huge group of friends
871652 she would say i dont know who leaves four girls in charge of these important statistics but they did
871653 she was a cheerleader not officially but she was spirited involved in school activities fun high energy and hung out with all the cheerleaders frequently
871654 she had such a smile that everybody wanted to be around her
871655 i think it cost us money to have her work there
871656 i keep saying american eagle stock is going to drop this year
871657 tongue in cheek she said i cant bring my good tiara to school someone might take it so ill have to bring my back up tiara
871658 i figured our life with her would be short because she would be building her own life
871659 that will be the hardest thing ill miss her smile the most
871660 she wanted everyone to be friends she reached out to all people and had many social circles
871661 she always had a smile on her face she was one of the nicest girls ive ever met
871662 it wouldnt surprise me to come downstairs and find meredith on the couch even if hannah wasnt here
871663 whatever meredith wanted to do hannah wanted to do she was a fixture in this house
871664 i think she was the best cheerleader on the team
871665 i think she was playing for the social aspect of it
871666 i just loved it id come down the hall and hear hey uncle hannah always had a smile she might be one of the happiest people i knew
871667 she was constantly on the go or on the phone
871668 it was hard to sit her down for five minutes
871669 she was nervous she wasnt going to make any friends
871670 but i said that was impossible she didnt even have to try

871713 i see these guys and the at bats they have and maybe it rubs off on me i just sit and watch
871714 a couple of tough hops for the guys we have nobody to blame but ourselves
871715 we talk about a lot of things but right now raz is in the rotation
871716 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
871717 i really appreciate manny being here but i dont think hes our saviour
871718 everybody wants him to be and man i hope he is but we still have to pitch and we still have to play now that were going to play with him hell make us better and well make him better
871719 i mean he hit 70 home runs in one year mannys not going to do that hopefully itll just be easier for us to score runs than before when it was such a nail pulling issue for us
871720 they gave me a lot of good pitches to hit and i drove it
871721 im still nervous out there but im going to play hard no matter what
871722 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
871723 that just puts it in perspective there is a lot of excitement going on right now with the fans
871724 i didnt have control and when i got it in the zone they hit it hard
871725 i didnt do my job today but ill go out there again in five days and do my job

871864 css sprites are a way to reduce the number of http requests made for image resources referenced by your site images are combined into one larger image at defined x and y coorindates having assigned this generated image to relevant page elements the background position css property can then be used to shift the visible area to the required component image this technique can be very effective for improving site performance particularly in situations where many small images such as menu icons are used the yahoo home page for example employs the technique for exactly this
871865 now you can change the width of your sidebar and header previously the height of the header was defined by the logo or turn off the sidebar and header entirely you now have control over the width of your site which previously was always 100 of the browser width you can also set the width of text boxes if you do not want your content to fill the whole space of the page by default
871866 when you want to embed one of your google docs documents spreadsheets or presentations you can now conveniently select it from a list rather than pasting the url into the document with google webmaster tools it is easier to see how google indexes your content and if you enable the integration you can also auto generate a sitemap to submit to google

871868 the videos on the home page today represent just a sliver of whats out there in terms of content made by or for the hearing impaired we focused mostly on american sign language asl but we also spotted signed videos in many other languages like this one of the swedish alphabet and we loved seeing the site used by the deaf community to help organize a prom to call out to cyclists and even to vent about a troublesome roommate in other words this weeks trendspotting tuesday may be sign language themed but really its just another day in the life of youtube
871869 i think the opening partnerships in both the innings was a turning point of the match sehwag getting a double hundred and giving fantastic starts with was very important
871870 he sehwag is a very good player and the way he scored runs in both the innings was great getting 201 in a total of 329 is something amazing
871871 it was also amazing the way harbhajan singh bowled in both the innings and then ishant and
871872 it was something special from the 19 year old sharma everybody saw what he is capable of it augurs really well going into the last test
871873 i was never worried you cannot say 300 350 is enough but on this wicket if you have 300 and the way our new ball bowlers bowled was amazing
871874 getting three wickets for 10 runs within 40 minutes was crucial and that put sri lanka on the backfoot
871875 i am really proud of the way we played in this test we are confident of putting up a good show and if we repeat this performance we will get a good result
871876 as the series goes on you try and figure out the best possible ways to handle the spinners they are quality spinners mendis is a mystery to some of us but sehwag has shown that you can get runs against the spinners
871877 it was important to get a good start when you are chasing any total which we did not get losing three wickets for 10 runs was not ideal and thats where we probably lost the game
871878 we had a plan but when you lose three quick wickets it is very difficult to fight back our batting was not consistent enough i thought we could give them a better fight
871879 i am very happy for ajantha he bowled brilliantly and supported the other bowlers as well but it is very disappointing to lose the game in which he has taken 10 wickets
871880 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals

871882 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
871883 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
871884 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
871885 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
871886 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
871887 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this

871904 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
871905 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
871906 as well as we knew each other and the way the labs were run someone would discover what was going on
871907 especially since dry spores were not something that we prepared or worked with

871920 gender is probably the most restricting force in american life
871921 in an urgent memo sent to gop members and staff saturday
871922 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering
871923 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
871924 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the hand maidens of the oil companies
871925 they were too tired to do the peoples business so they went home for a rest while the american poor sat at home unable to drive to their jobs i think they forgot about the poor and middle class will you have gas money to get to the polls on election day
871926 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
871927 not bad is good and im willing to compromise and do good provided before we do good we study our plan and make sure what we plan to do is not bad oh and by the way im not rigid
871928 my stand on preventing off shore drilling is hurting my campaign and the democrat party so ill make it sound like if elected id allow off shore drilling but have no fear ill make sure off shore drilling is studied for eight to ten years and it wont happen on my watch
871929 ignorance is the greatest commodity we pay for in this country
871930 i love how people constantly claim that the lift of the executive ban on offshore drilling is why gas prices are going down its demand dummies
871931 to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife there and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations
871932 were the best and were going to make things work
871933 ignorant drilling now wont change the price of gas it might effect the futures market but nothing more than 50 cents to a dollar every single drop of oil we currently drill out goes to the open market none of it earmarked for american consumption want to lower prices demand that the oil we drill never leave the nation

871970 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
871971 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the the western australian liberal party
871972 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
871973 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
871974 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
871975 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
871976 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
871977 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
871978 there are concerns the economy may be slowing faster than expected senior analyst lee wai tuck said from singapore
871979 the economy may slow we dont use the word recession the economy may slow too quickly
871980 it now is obvious to almost everyone that extremely tight financial conditions are bringing the australian economy to a screeching halt he said
871981 as i said to the treasurer wayne swan i dont think his outrage is going to do too much good he said
871982 the best way to do it reduce bank lending rates is through the reserve bank because the reserve bank is in a position to see the balance sheets of the banks and the treasurer isnt
871983 in conjunction with other economic data released in recent months the job advertisements series provides further evidence that the current level of interest rates is achieving the rbas desired slowing in domestic economic growth he said
871984 there will be scope for the reserve bank to take its foot off the brake he said

871990 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
871991 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
871992 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
871993 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
871994 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
871995 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
871996 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it
871997 let amp squo s get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
871998 we worked so hard and put so much into it a qc and barrister doing it pro bono without charge i havent had the guts to read the judgment its quite nauseating

872007 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
872008 is israels lifeblood no one understands this better than israels enemies that is precisely why they still engage in a systematic campaign to erase the historical link of the jews to this great city for if israel were severed from jerusalem the jewish state would lose its sense of legitimacy and its will to fight only then could israel be destroyed
872009 what befalls jerusalem threatens the security of the united states and its allies worldwide thats because jerusalem and israel are ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy radicalism and moderation terrorism and freedom
872010 if a land has a soul then jerusalem is the soul of the land of israel

872037 there are a lot of resources out there but there has to be quality control
872038 what were trying to do is take the burden away from the schools so they can focus on teaching and learning
872039 the idea is to build an edumall which is evaluated by its users so that good resources will be highlighted
872040 resources that arent so useful will sink to the bottom of the pile and can be removed as necessary
872041 as edumall grows its going to be very big and this is how people like to work online they want things to be personalised they want to talk to other people to have a home online and the personal space provides that
872042 independent learning for instance students dont always have to go through the teacher
872043 we talk a lot about remedial and enrichment work and it takes a lot of time not only for the teacher but also for students
872044 digitalisation is changing the way students learn and we have to accept that
872045 i guess well only know how much easier when it comes into use
872046 we are potentially closer than we have ever been to a deal
872047 what makes news nowadays is the growing list of mainstream economists who are questioning globalisations supposedly unmitigated virtues

872054 i guess those guys are kind of used to these rallies
872055 that was just going to set up a slider for the next pitch
872056 all we want to do is go out there and do our best to help the team
872057 i know its going to take us some time and were not like those guys that left here in the trades but were going to try
872058 at 3 54 we made the decision that were either going to wait for this boston los angeles deal or were holding onto jason bay and walking away from a couple other deals
872059 i felt like wed gone through so many what if scenarios weve gone through the clubs in such great detail that we felt like we knew what we had to have if it wasnt reached we were ready to walk way if it was we were ready to move
872060 we definitely jumped into the deep end involved with the yankees red sox dodgers and being very deep into conversations with other clubs too
872061 but i came away very pleased with the process with the dynamic in the room
872062 we have put a dollar figure out there and well see what happens
872063 were still optimistic hell sign if not well have the third pick in the draft next year
872064 our third and fourth round picks both were shortstops so one had to go up
872065 were obviously not happy with whats gone on in state college
872066 its a situation that we hope never happens again but we see it as an aberration
872067 id say all eight would be in our top 15 maybe our top 10

872083 we are for peace we are for honorable and long lasting peace christians and muslim live in harmony and peace in zamboanga city and we respect each other culture and religion
872084 this issue of ancestral domain again cropped up we are appealing to the government peace panel to listen to our calls we are part of mindanao we are part of the philippines we are filipinos and we should thread what binds us together and not our differences we do not believe that a juridical entity should be created out of religion or base on segregation here we should live together and in harmony

872100 but the indispensably at the events are different such as reporters seeking fit to network executives
872101 maybe it works to everybodys advantage that there will be follow up stories to questions that come out of comic con
872102 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of mob are losing their homes and their jobs
872103 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

872106 the first quarter performance clearly reflects efficacy of our business model wherein the changing market conditions has a minimal affect on the growth the home textiles business is showing steady growth trends while the soda ash business during the period witnessed a strong growth which we would like to consolidate going forward the forthcoming launch of our retail operations in the domestic market augurs well for the company as this would help us fully leverage the business model put in place where in we successfully integrated the indian and foreign operations in the home textiles businesses ghcl would continue to improve overall efficiencies for better productivity and margins to address the emerging situations in the market environment and deliver value to the stakeholders across the categories we expect to bring in a strong performance in the coming quarters

872129 depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of god
872130 while we sit here deliberating in cold debate somewhere in this field of death every second of time marks the dying gasp of a human being

872132 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game

872140 a good film is very hard to make whatever kind of film it is because it has to go beyond whatever genre it is to make it a great film period its about telling a great story thats intriguing that builds that builds the characters thats multidimensional and is going somewhere interesting and i think also for horror films there are only so many scary horror films you can make
872141 we shot it in june and we find out i think in mid august glenn gordon caron i knew he was so talented from all of this projects hes made but working with him i was more and more in awe of him as the days progressed which is usually not what happens he was just so wonderful to work with that i hope it will become a series
872142 she wakes up in this in between world thats not heaven or hell
872143 its sort of this next place you go its sort of this master control realm theyre giving her an orientation and she meets this person who ioan gruffudd plays and shes basically told that shes dead and has this new job now helping people on earth straighten out their lives shed led a very frivolous life and shes not the kindest of people so when she dies she realizes there is something to be said about being a good person
872144 i am an angel who comes back to earth but its not touched by an angel by any means
872145 when i was talking to glenn about this he said it was a romance that it was
872146 i wanted the character and the situations she faced to be very normal
872147 my thinking was that the horror aspects of the story would become more terrifying because of the connection the reader felt with the character
872148 the town is sort of the verge of being a ghost town with empty houses everywhere
872149 she hates it there but shes stuck with the help of a new friend she begins to notice that there are some freaky things going in that place
872150 these arent the roving rotten flesh kind that only exist in the movies
872151 these zombies are beautiful popular but very dead and they want hannah to become one of them
872152 they use blood from the living to maintain their own appearance of being among the living
872153 i know some people are purists but i like the idea of reinventing these universal monsters i think it keeps them terrifying if they keep evolving but rest assured my zombies are still the flesh eating homicidal creatures that everyone is familiar with
872154 prior to writing it id lived in new york city for 10 years
872155 i relocated to the middle of nowhere about a year before writing zombie blondes there was a quite a bit of culture shock going from manhattan to the woods of a small town there was something scary about these secluded little towns and i worked that into the book
872156 the question i had was where are all the people going to come from to fill those units
872157 we have people leaving the city we have no jobs here im kind of wondering whos going to fill up all those units whos going to pay all that kind of money to buy in that area
872158 yes the canal project is a great idea but you need to have the basics first meat and potatoes before dessert

872160 our land has been selling and we have to keep up with demand

872163 i assure you i am striving for a thorough and expeditious review of this matter
872164 i am encouraged that the bishop is taking this to another level
872165 it appears to me that if he is taking it back to the presbyteral council that he would have to go to them with something different that there is some change being made
872166 wants to ensure that the needs of all parishioners especially the needs of those with disabilities are being met
872167 whether this is a complete reversal or if the church stays open as a secondary worship site or is designated as a site for the disabled we just dont know
872168 but i think there were a few more smiles on people today as they were leaving church
872169 why would you close a church that already allows total access and inclusion and keep open a church that would have to be made compliant

872218 neither before nor after josiah was there a king like him who turned to the lord as he did with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength
872219 the other events of josiahs reign and his acts of devotion according to what is written in the law of the lord all the events from beginning to end are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah

872225 who would have thought id play a spicoli like character and then make out with spicoli in the same year
872226 it couldnt be a better showcase for his talent to look at these two roles theyre both different sides of him
872227 he be able to bring the attributes of the not old stoner guy he needs for pineapple but underneath that is the scholar and the deep thinker and the guy who wants to learn about art and is interested in politics his performances are complex and layered
872228 a very smart sweet person he seems to have really evolved over the last 10 years into this verily easygoing approachable warm subject when we did freaks and geeks he was so hungry and obsessed with the work it made him a little more of an intense guy now hes to a high degree happy in his animated existence
872229 we sent him pineapple for the role of dale the idea came up to switch roles

872232 they wanted me to wear these guatemalan pants i was like who wears these awful things and judd and shauna robertson the other producer are good friends with woody harrelson and said woody wears these all the time i even met some other friends of woodys and theyre like yeah woody wears them thats how the outfit came about
872233 i was always going to play saul they found me in my apartment in that place was no script they just came into my place my dealer came back me it was consummate elaborate
872234 i used to smoke weed but i havent done it in a long lifetime everybody steady now thinks that guy is stoned its just the way i talk because i dont smoke weed somehow theres something about me the way i talk that implies that im on drugs
872235 we got them leashes so we could take them outside because theyre completely indoor cats they got so scared
872236 were walking down sunset and one of them got out of the leash and jumped over the fence to the chateau marmont we were hunting him down in the bushes of the chateau marmont
872237 we used to laugh because in between takes hed be reading the iliad on set we still havent versed in books the iliad it was a very difficult book with him it was always james joyce or something
872238 this sounds so pretentious but i was reading proust and judd is like why do you read things like that i dont know its good limit judd reads he gave me a great book called a fans notes by a guy named frederick exley
872239 in that places a sensitivity that exudes from him he can without trying make you see into his soul he makes it seem effortless
872240 what do you think about me being the other girl
872241 and he would always ask me if my girlfriend was the better kisser

872251 i wonder if mccain fancies himself a bit of a fashion plate
872252 maybe the senator has some help in the shoe shopping department from his fashion plate wife
872253 but wasnt senator obama the guy being called an elitist
872254 dont pan down to the shoes because weve talked about getting new shoes for him
872255 michelle has asked me to clean up because when she first met me i had one suit michelle always finds this funny because i basically buy five of the same suit and then i patch them up and wear them repeatedly i have four pairs of shoes recently ive taken to getting a haircut more frequently than i used to because my mother in law makes fun of me
872256 shouild they meet again perhaps this simple 275 prada sandal might work for senator mccain
872257 im not a right wing blogger and the 520 shoes belong to john mccain and frankly i dont think how much his shoes cost matters one whit for how hed govern the country
872258 its long been obvious that mccains only prospect for winning would be to move the election away from debates over issues where his positions are widely rejected by the public and instead demonize barack obama as an effete elitist effeminate far leftist terrorist loving radical what is far more notable than mccains now almost complete reliance on rovian demonization themes is how obediently the establishment media has been spouting and disseminating them
872259 were discussing how to franchise new drum corps in canada so its a set formula for finances how others can get the finances and recruit for their corps and how our kids can go out and be instructors for these new corps
872260 we have a small business owner who is spearheading this idea hes talking about setting up a package that anyone can take to a city approach the local government for canada council arts grants show them the financial requirements and get something going in conjunction with the local governments this program would be offered free to whoever is interested
872261 it would be a total package that we can give to potential directors to get the ball rolling and get corps started the programs must be self sustaining so theyre not concentrating on government money were trying to iron out the details as we go but we need to give it a try for the sustainability of drum corps in canada

872278 i think the opening partnerships in both the innings was a turning point of the match sehwag getting a double hundred and giving fantastic starts with was very important
872279 he sehwag is a very good player and the way he scored runs in both the innings was great getting 201 in a total of 329 is something amazing
872280 it was also amazing the way harbhajan singh bowled in both the innings and then ishant and
872281 it was something special from the 19 year old sharma everybody saw what he is capable of it augurs really well going into the last test
872282 i was never worried you cannot say 300 350 is enough but on this wicket if you have 300 and the way our new ball bowlers bowled was amazing
872283 getting three wickets for 10 runs within 40 minutes was crucial and that put sri lanka on the backfoot
872284 i am really proud of the way we played in this test we are confident of putting up a good show and if we repeat this performance we will get a good result
872285 as the series goes on you try and figure out the best possible ways to handle the spinners they are quality spinners mendis is a mystery to some of us but sehwag has shown that you can get runs against the spinners
872286 it was important to get a good start when you are chasing any total which we did not get losing three wickets for 10 runs was not ideal and thats where we probably lost the game
872287 we had a plan but when you lose three quick wickets it is very difficult to fight back our batting was not consistent enough i thought we could give them a better fight
872288 i am very happy for ajantha he bowled brilliantly and supported the other bowlers as well but it is very disappointing to lose the game in which he has taken 10 wickets
872289 we dont have any information about it we have not heard of this matter

872305 i was slapped by a policeman when i sought his help following the stampede then other policemen joined in and lathi charged the crowds present there this made things worse after the stampede had the police helped people the casualties would not have been so high
872306 we have been receiving bodies in heaps since the first truckload arrived around 2 p m sunday there is not even enough space to put up the bodies properly so we have put them up in all available places
872307 there were hardly any policemen at naina devi keeping in view the crowds that came sunday and when the rumour of a landslide led to mayhem and stampede the policemen only aggravated the situation by cane charging people two of my nieces died in the stampede but i was able to save many others

872312 we were hurting after the munster final its not easy to lose games but we are in a better state right now going into next weekend than we would have been if we had won
872313 this team has been on the road for many years we talked about that and we have talked about the success of the team and how that success can take its toll hunger has always been an issue for this team and it continues to be that
872314 i think we showed the necessary hunger to win tight games and maybe go a bit further in this championship
872315 we kept our noses just in front and that gave us a psychological advantage going down the stretch
872316 we were hugely disappointed with second half against cork we sat idly by for the last four weeks and it hasnt been easy we showed rustiness in the first half
872317 its a work in progress when we went direct and early with the ball i felt we had them in trouble
872318 i thought tommy performed quite well and kieran created so many different things he has finesse too which people forget
872319 ive given this job four years of my life i have a young family and i have a lots of businesses in monaghan ill take two weeks and go away with the family and ill decide in five or six weeks
872320 you make your own luck it just looks that every time that monaghan comes with a good team kerry are on a roll
872321 the reality is that kerry can stop everybodys roll and no matter what team comes and goes kerry is the team to beat in the country they always will be
872322 it was enjoyable in the end but wed have to be honest and admit it was a poor game of football in the first half we played a lot better in the second half
872323 we worked hard to pick things up during the week and we thought we had succeeded but unfortunately bad shooting came back to haunt us
872324 i have communicated with croke park and i have told them the feeling here in cork there is a strong feeling here after last year they the supporters feel that they deserve it this year and i think there should be some appreciation of that on the part of croke park

872342 stunned motorists were confronted with the sight of a 500kg bull charging straight at them yesterday when a show bound bovine made a bid for freedom down one of brisbanes busiest inner city roads
872343 i was just keeping up with it so we could contain it and know where it was
872344 youve got to tell these city people that the next time someone is running up the street behind a bull to just stop and not get out of their car and try to wrangle it for us
872345 most of the traffic stopped and there were cars and people following it trying to keep the traffic away

872349 wow a timeless rocking chair this is good for my mom
872350 i feel lonely lately like everything that is around is there for me but at the same time itd be better in a way if i were to go away for awhile and see if anyone would really even miss me when i were to return it might seem unjustifiable but at the same time its something that we all go through at one time or another some of us are just aware of it more than others some it doesnt happen to as much as others it just all depends on what kind of person you are sure we all have different personalities but there are still simularities that certain people have amongst one another i want to go somewhere that ill be seen as a god but the thing about that is if you were to go back later on to your regular life youd either be sad all the time because people didnt see you the same way anymore or youd go crazy and start killing anyone who didnt see you as what you once were in another place or youd leave thinking that you needed no one that didnt think the world of you and in the end its good that not everyone thinks of you in the highest regards because then when you have someone to yourself that cares about you as much as you do them it doesnt really mean anything isnt it better to have less of the perfectionism that makes us truly human rather than be at a higher regard than everyone else
872351 dont talk just stop it will all be alright in the end do what you want no one can tell you otherwise just make sure you run run run when the cops come looking for you they really dont have as much authority as they think they do they deserve to die for being so nosy there are times that i dont want to help anybody at all and its because you really dont have to if you dont want to we just have the instinct that we have to help anyone in distrest and i honestly dont see why were like that seeing as how most of us are selfish in the first place
872352 not to be ungrateful or anything but maybe it pays down a bill but it doesnt pay down every bill every month the short term quick fix kinda stuff sounds good and it may even feel good that first month when you get that check and then you go out and you buy a pair of earrings
872353 i know were spending i added it up for the first time we spend between the two kids on extracurriculars outside the classroom were spending about 10 000 a year on piano and dance and sports supplements and so on and so forth
872354 now were keeping like a bowl of fresh fruit in the house but you have to go to the fruit stand a couple of times a week to keep that fruit fresh enough that a not gonna eat the pruney grape you know at that point its like eww shes not gonna eat the brown banana or the shrivelledy up things its got to be fresh for them to want it whos got time to go to the fruit stand who can afford it first of all
872355 and the notion of trying to think about a lunch every day so you grab the lunchables right and the fruit juice box thing and we think we
872356 i wake up every morning wondering how on earth i am going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day i know that everybody in this room is going through this that is the dilemma women face today every woman that i know regardless of race education income background political affiliation is struggling to keep her head above water
872357 what i notice about men all men is that their order is me my family god is in there somewhere but me is first
872358 i am offended as a gay person and i am appalled as an american that somebody can commit a crime and not be held accountable and the people who are supposed to uphold that law are dismissing it
872359 its kind of hard to see how a civil union would be covered by the bigamy law but i have not done extensive research on this
872360 i dont get any sense that thats whats going on at all
872361 i think the rather unique facts and the multistate and international aspects combined with the fact that it appears to be civil not criminal makes it not likely to attract the attention of those whose job it is to prosecute criminal matters
872362 it wasnt just that we considered ourselves married all of our friends considered us married our families considered us married
872363 a person having a husband or wife living who marries another person
872364 youre getting into some novel legal issues with basically some real gray areas
872365 my impression is if she were charged with felonies it certainly would be illustrative of her character her disregard for the law so yes i think being charged with these crimes would definitely assist my case
872366 the sense i get from wells weiss is that everybodys passing the buck to somebody else which is always a frustrating thing
872367 but part of it is the situation perhaps by its nature doesnt lend itself cleanly or clearly to criminal investigation or prosecution and if so which jurisdiction canada vermont new york
872368 in my view it is bigamy but i would also say in my view given the state of flux and lack of clarity in the laws right now it would be a bad idea to prosecute it criminally
872369 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
872370 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
872371 how blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked nor stand in the path of sinners nor sit in the seat of scoffers but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law he meditates day and night
872372 pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is gods will for you in christ jesus
872373 but his delight is in the law of the lord
872374 thus also faith by itself if it does not have works is dead

872376 it is an affront for the radio hall of fame to honor james dobson a right wing demagogue
872377 the focus on the family broadcast was created as and remains a means of helping families thrive

872380 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them
872381 it was the family that raised me that rescued me i also didnt want to leave poland i thought it was the country that let me live
872382 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
872383 i think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life it stays with you all the time what you go through you cant throw it out of your memory
872384 my husband is very religious and doesnt especially care for the jews
872385 anytime he tried to say something against the jews i would tell him you forget who i am
872386 i was born and baptized and bred in a pretty staunch catholic upbringing
872387 its when you get into conversations with mom and you ask why is the sky blue
872388 i asked whats going to happen to howie goldstein when he dies
872389 im thinking wait a minute they seem like a pretty nice family
872390 why would god create a bunch of people and just because they have different beliefs punish them forever
872391 the last thing i want is to make a bunch of converts to atheism
872392 it doesnt bother me that people are religious or spiritual up until it moves them to do something that harms others
872393 the number just keeps going up or at least the number of people willing to come out of the closet is going up
872394 i had a friend who was very religious and said im going to pray for you
872395 i said its okay you dont need to pray for me
872396 and i am a good person im a very caring person i care for my cats and other people

872399 poland needs more people so many of our citizens live abroad and 1 5 million couples face being childless we are offering a service
872400 the church is wrong we can help these people they can not we are living in the 21st century
872401 surrogacy is contrary to the unity of marriage and to the dignity of the procreation of the human person it represents an objective failure to meet the obligations of maternal love of conjugal fidelity and of responsible motherhood it offends the dignity and the right of the child to be conceived carried in the womb brought into the world and brought up by his own parents it sets up to the detriment of families a division between the physical psychological and moral elements which constitute those families
872402 what i find refreshing about the scottish church is that you admit the inclusiveness of your church
872403 the british church is inclusive it just wont say it is
872404 its time for us to stop worrying so much about the church
872405 the church is not ours to win or lose the church is gods
872406 we gave the bible to slaves to keep them docile and they had the nerve to believe it and women and people in wheelchairs and gays
872407 there was an open service at lambeth and my picture was put up at every security checkpoint so i could be recognised and ejected if i turned up

872412 the solution to the hamas fatah split is to have elections now and the people will decide whether to elect abu mazen palestinian authority president and fatah chairman mahmoud abbas or hamas
872413 this is the way they work from providing medical services to religious services to even soccer teams
872414 if the government doesnt give enough money for sports activities or sports facilities they will construct them by donations and provide the services by so doing they will attract particularly the poor those that dont have enough money to pay
872415 if the government doesnt build a hospital here there is a vacuum
872416 this allows the islamic movement to come here and build hospitals take the credit provide the service and connect to the people
872417 the islamic movement gathered money here to pay for teachers and to clean the streets and people started trusting them
872418 the main goal of the islamic movement is to bring people to the best situation here in education in ethics
872419 they are struggling in the same political field as the islamic movement
872420 they still know their situation is better than elsewhere in the arab world
872421 where the israeli government is neglecting or failing to set lines and limits they go in and do whatever they can in support of their ideology until someone wakes up and says we have to show them the limits of laws
872422 only rarely do archeologists come across findings of significant figures in history which help lift the dust of history and bring the biblical story to life in such a tangible way
872423 i was in shock i could not move i could not do anything
872424 we are ordering dna tests for all children whose mothers present credible indications that they were abducted and we are asking parents of those two babies in the us to voluntarily submit dna tests of their adoptive children
872425 these people are absolutely devastated horrified over the idea a child was stolen from a mother
872426 maybe its because they saw i was vulnerable all alone in the shoe store
872427 that photograph kept me company during those terrible 14 months
872428 you have no idea how hard it is when your own child rejects you
872429 she will not take toys and when you lift your hand she cowers and runs away
872430 i kind of look at the department of homeland security right now as sort of a somewhat delinquent student
872431 theyve had some homework assignments and theyve been by no means easy homework assignments but they havent really turned them in
872432 thats kind of like being tasked with a research paper and just handing in the outline
872433 its ok but it really wasnt what the assignment was
872434 thats an assignment weve all been watching we watched millions get poured into the system that still hasnt been delivered
872435 weve been lucky so far but with global economy i dont know how long our luck is going to last
872436 its one thing to have the spectrum available its another to have the equipment available
872437 caring consumers to the truth about how over 90pc of pork bacon and ham is produced in this country
872438 they experience fear pain and many emotions not unlike the family pet
872439 yet most pigs raised in australia are confined in factory farms where they are denied any quality of life
872440 what they are forced to endure in the name of profit would be illegal if they were instead a dog or cat
872441 trapped in a cycle of suffering she is forced to give birth on a hard concrete floor denied the ability to nurture her young and will be continually impregnated until her body can no longer physically cope

872447 i think keller knows in her heart that she should not pursue her relationship with ronon but its just this physical attraction but she has a very intellectual attraction with mckay and i think she understands him in a way that a lot of other people dont when hes complaining and going on and on about how terrible things are and how sick he is or whatever she just kind of has a way of dissipating that in him and going okay you know what rodney just chill out so yeah with those two shes eventually going to have to make a choice

872460 a further proposal is the definite expansion of the coast guard in the matter of border patrol
872461 navy and coast guard losses were 4 729 killed and 4 640 wounded

872468 it was a unique opportunity to create applications to deliver content to millions of facebook users across the globe
872469 the entries were of a high calibre and we believe a lot of the applications have the potential to be successful and popular in facebook
872470 we were very impressed with the response from the information technology community in south africa and the creativity and quality of the applications
872471 we may be using webcams and internet technologies but youre still trying to find that chemistry
872472 and if it isnt there you just move on to the next person
872473 if people decide they dont like someone they usually know within 30 seconds
872474 if you meet someone you like three minutes isnt long enough if you dont like them 30 seconds is too long
872475 if you see someone you like in real life you dont go up to them with your resume and compare you just talk
872476 i wanted to be a little ridiculous and put myself out there
872477 my mom said the more places you put your resume the better chance you have for finding a job i figured id do the same thing with dating
872478 eight to 10 percent of our users have been to real dating sites
872479 were more about meeting new friends not necessarily meeting new dates
872480 the dating stories are good to hear and weve got plenty of them
872481 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
872482 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
872483 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
872484 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
872485 south korea is a leading testbed for the it industry and the internet media here certainly has a frontier like aspect in leading experimental democracy
872486 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information
872487 we now have a presence with about 170 to 180 of the top 350 customers in south africa

872496 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honourable thing and step down from this board
872497 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
872498 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
872499 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
872500 a girlfriend who was involved in a breakup is now trying to convince the world she was the initiator and not the victim

872523 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
872524 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
872525 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
872526 ships aircraft and industrial equipment burn huge quantities of fossil fuel causing greenhouse gas pollution yet president george w bush stalls with one bureaucratic dodge after another
872527 because bushs environmental protection agency continues to wantonly ignore its duty to regulate pollution california is forced to seek judicial action
872528 the lawsuit is certainly typical of the attorney general of california

872557 but i feel it more so now especially when im at a crossroads people are asking what you do now and you say social work im a case manager people are like thats it im like its so much more than what you think
872558 ive had colleagues recently tell me cedric its admirable that youre doing what youre doing but you should be doing something else you should be doing greater things i feel that way but i feel what im doing now is great in its own way
872559 we believe that once integrated housing is in place it will ease those tensions and build that tolerance
872560 the system has to have something in place to give them a push one day these guys will get out and theyll have to learn to live among different people if he can be tolerant in prison he can be tolerant on the street
872561 i always wanted to be center stage at the concert hall
872562 this is like do good and avoid evil or buy low and sell high
872563 assume a posture of respectful intellectual equality with the bench
872564 designed to include members of the community rather than to proselytize
872565 todays ruling is a vindication of the constitutional principle that the government must not take sides when it comes to religion
872566 the whole point of it is to make u va more accessible
872567 its trying to make the process less intimidating less formidable
872568 tell my family and friends i love them tell the governor he just lost my vote yall hurry this along im dying to get out of here
872569 i find no compelling reason to set aside the sentence that was recommended by the jury and then imposed and affirmed by the courts
872570 he didnt think about that when he took that lamp off the table and hit my son with it i know my son had pain
872571 but we hope that virginias procedures will someday be improved
872572 apples secrecy keeps them from properly testing out their apps with tons of users the way other companies do who arent so worried about secrecy
872573 apples mobile me just deleted every single item from my outlook calendar on windows vista gone deleted
872574 well since we know mobileme didnt do this maliciously it is software after all how about posting more about what you actually did that might have caused this so your readers might be able to help or provide suggestions
872575 essentially we are seeking to prevent qualcomm from imposing on nokia the licensing terms of an old agreement contrary to the terms of that agreement and based on a vague allegation of use of patents that have never been identified
872576 further we are asking the courts clarification on acceptable corporate behavior in a standard setting environment
872577 we believe this means you should not be entitled to seek court injunctions for essential patents
872578 if it was such a bad deal why did they negotiate so hard to extend that deal
872579 if it was a good deal when it was 50 patents its an awfully good deal now that we have 7 000 patents to license
872580 the developers planning charter square a two tower project on the site of the old convention center on fayetteville street expect to forge ahead with the first building despite speculation that proposed condominiums would stall its start the 20 story tower is to include about 300 000 square feet of offices ground floor shops and at least 30 condominiums
872581 wilmington street between martin and davie streets is closed the city of raleigh hoped to open one lane of traffic by 8 a m the break happened around 4 30 a m and crews were able to shut off the water main just before 6 a m
872582 was overwhelming that you were a leader in this conspiracy
872583 its an astronomical amount of pcp that is coming here and being dumped into the community
872584 we dont have any way of reading your minds if you move let us know
872585 after much reflection and discussion we have decided to separate after 15 years of marriage
872586 so that we can both be actively engaged as parents for our children
872587 its like the kind matt dillon used to use on gunsmoke
872588 my first reaction is we shouldnt have had to be here in the first place
872589 its a great feeling to be returning to a state of normalcy when it comes to being able to defend your life in your household
872590 the point of this whole thing is to get people to serve on juries its not to lock them up
872591 i never received any more notices so i thought everything was taken care of at that point
872592 i guess i need to call them and get this straightened out
872593 weve seen a lot of instances where a company will be working on a product thats not even released yet and the diagrams for that product are already out on the net
872594 this case is unique because of the high profile of the targets the individuals on this list are at a very high risk almost imminent of identity theft
872595 i didnt even know what peer to peer was i do now
872596 this may explain why two weeks ago i got a 9 000 cellphone bill from at amp t
872597 i am pretty confident that the people of the district of columbia want us to err in the direction of trying to restrict guns
872598 the second amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms
872599 its clear the supreme court didnt intend for you to have a loaded gun around the house i dont think the court thought this was going to become a wild west scene
872600 being used against a reasonably perceived threat of immediate harm
872601 an actual threat by somebody you believe is out to hurt you
872602 i dont think they intended that anybody who had a vague notion of a threat should have access to a gun
872603 content to serve as a caretaker for the regime of excessive executive power established by the bush administration
872604 they embraced the fight for a new judiciary as a dream to correct all ills
872605 he is our big hope in our drive to support the rule of law
872606 to americas detriment because terror cannot be fought without democracy and democracy cant be sustained without an independent judiciary
872607 we try not to focus on some of the issues that will be taken care of later on
872608 the goal is to restore legal protection to preborn babies from the moment they are conceived which is the only way were going to stop abortion
872609 if we give fertilized eggs legal rights abortion could be considered murder and a woman could be sent to jail for making the difficult life decision to terminate a pregnancy
872610 because this amendment would define a person in a given way and expand the universe of who persons are it expands the reach of laws that deal with persons
872611 if a pregnant woman is really two people with exactly equal rights then it is not clear the pregnant woman can undergo any medical treatment that jeopardizes a fertilized egg
872612 even though the success wasnt immediate this battle isnt over
872613 in our view you dont have to have a personhood amendment before the court to overturn roe v wade you just need the right court so we are more interested in the makeup of the court than what particular challenge comes before the court
872614 we knew that netroots nation was holding its conference in austin this weekend so we looked at it more as an opportunity to meet them head on
872615 they thought i was the new hire you know the new manager coming in
872616 i think its really of kind of funny its like they have to justify their existence by comparing themselves to us
872617 the point of rightonline is to get the conservatives focused and engaged and all sitting in the same room together
872618 up until now we didnt really have an answer to something like netroots nation we were all doing our own thing not really working together
872619 its the first contested war crimes trial since world war ii so its important
872620 youre looking at it primarily and appropriately as bringing mr hamdan to justice but were also well aware that it provides the first opportunity to test and validate this mechanism
872621 this was supposed to be the premier system for bringing to justice the masterminds of the worst crime ever committed on u s soil
872622 the only result in seven years was the conviction of an australian kangaroo trapper who is now free
872623 i find it ironic that there is this tremendous rush to unfairly discount a very well thought out military system
872624 mr hamdan and these other suspects are getting more due process than any of the people who were beheaded by the terrorists in iraq and afghanistan
872625 the notion that youre going to obtain csi level evidence on the battlefield is absurd
872626 the government can hold mr hamdan all the way up until the end of hostilities
872627 it could hold him longer if he were convicted and sentenced beyond that in a commission
872628 my trainer paul hamilton has a lot of experience in thai boxing and ive spent the last four months training with that in mind ive been training at 7 in the morning and doing bits of vale tudo as well
872629 i cant kick for toffee yet but dont worry that will come ive already told hammo trainer hamilton to find out who the british champion is at my weight so i can have a go at him and ill tell you what ill smash his face in

872642 these are important and necessary changes that will provide an improved and efficient service to residents

872786 e stata una battaglia iniziata nell83 oggi penso dovrebbe essere una cosa del tutto naturale consentire a un detenuto soprattutto se ergastolano di avere un figlio con la propria moglie o compagna

872788 lo sentii dire che chi fa del male a un bambino va subito ucciso ricorda la iacone distinto gli feci ma che dice scusi mia madre mi sgrid lui era cutolo non dovevo permettermi di rivolgermi cos a quelluomo raffaele si ferm mi guard era incuriosito pochi mesi e ci siamo fidanzati lho baciato una sola volta in ventanni il giorno del matrimonio in carcere lui me lo disse se ti sposi con me come essere vedova oggi mi ha regalato una figlia e sono felice

872860 the officer was using the baton as he was taught to
872861 but we very much keep in mind what recordings cant do they only show part of the story
872862 one of the most aggressive police departments in the country
872863 its hard to believe that these incidents arent happening a great deal more than the ones actually ending up on video
872864 using force is ugly but if you dont do that youll have a violent felon running around
872865 we do things people in an office or store or hospital dont have to do
872866 the theory is that if gas prices go up people walk or bike more or they take public transportation which requires walking to and from stops on either end
872867 also people eat out less when gas prices are high because they would have to drive to the restaurant and they have less disposable income
872868 i found that a permanent one dollar rise in gas prices is associated with a seven percent drop in overweight and a nine percent drop in obesity
872869 achieving just the minimum 35 miles per gallon fleet wide average by 2020 would cut oil use by 1 1 million barrels a day
872870 cutting the cost of gasoline at todays prices by more than a dollar per gallon
872871 further achieving a 35 mpg fleet wide average would create 149 000 new jobs nationwide in 2020

872882 il carico radioattivo ritrovato mentre andava nella discarica appena aperta a savignano dimostra tutto il pericolo che questo piano rifiuti rappresenta per la nostra regione
872883 se da un lato si sottolinea c la gestione illegale dei rifiuti che pu portare a situazioni come quella di oggi dallaltro c il decreto governativo che legalizza lo sversamento della gran parte dei rifiuti tossici fanghi chimici ceneri pesanti ecc per fare della campania lo sversatoio a basso prezzo dellindustria settentrionale per questo vitale perseguire modelli alternativi praticabili e richiesti dalla stessa unione europea

872934 tidak timbul masalah pas menyertai kerajaan kerana pas masih lagi bersama dengan pakatan rakyat
872935 namun apa yang timbul sekarang perkataan muzakarah itu seolah perlawanan seperti yang berlaku di dewan bahasa dan pustaka baru baru ini di antara menteri penerangan dan dato seri anwar ibrahim
872936 kita tidak mahu berlawan macam itu kita nafikan ada muzakarah kalau dedahkan begitu akan menimbulkan masalah kerana akan ada yang kalah dan menang hanya apa yang ada sekadar pertemuan biasa
872937 bagaimanapun kita mahu lihat respon daripada umno terhadap apa yang kita kemukakan terlebih dahulu

872953 obama no considera en modo alguno que la campa a de mccain est empleando la raza como un tema de debate pero est seguro de que los republicanos est n empleando las mismas pol ticas de baja estofa de toda la vida para asegurarse de que los votantes se distraigan de las verdaderas cuestiones de esta campa a cuestiones de las que obama seguir hablando
872954 si obama es presidente se le puede seguir llamando casa blanca
872955 una campa a de desprestigio no es algo bonito de ver caer tan bajo no deber a ser propio de mccain pero los dem cratas ser an unos inconscientes si no se dieran cuenta de que a veces este tipo de estrategias funcionan

872971 hearst will either have to print decent newspapers or get out of the business as for hearst personally his reclamation and elevation to the plane of honorable men is not to be thought of he will always remaind the degraded unclean thing that he is shunned by every honest citizen and for whose wandering feet there shall be no resting place where the american flag rises and falls upon the breeze

872986 socialism is a fraud a comedy a phantom a blackmail
872987 the true forms of government are those in which the one or the few or the many govern with a view to the common interest
872988 the voice of the people is the voice of god
872989 god is near of you with you in you a sacred spirit has its seat in us it is the observer and keeper of our good deeds and our wrongdoings
872990 socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it
872991 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood
872992 i counted 15 bodies most of them of women who were torn to pieces
872993 from what i can see they are women who were cleaning the area there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
872994 we received 47 civilians who were injured in the blast and so far five have died in the hospital three of them women
872995 its the largest number of civilians we have received from one incident in weeks
872996 she had been doing this kind of work for three months but now she has lost everything she has lost her life
872997 cos perdo una pagina vista e le impression dei vari banner
872998 we are not going to speculate or jump to conclusions until we have gathered all the evidence
872999 investigations into the blast are in full swing and at this stage you cannot rule out anything there have been suggestions that this could be the act of criminals out to destroy vital information but there is also a strong view that politics could be involved
873000 right now police are examining debris from the blast a live bomb which was also supposed to explode was discovered we are working on the origins of the bomb
873001 lets play farm team for the yankees and sure well accept a handful of magic beans in return
873002 whats wrong the people in this town why cant they make a decent bagel here
873003 oh look the fat guy is in the all you can eat seats i wonder how many hot dogs and nachos hell pound down
873004 mentoring obama during his formative high school years in hawaii
873005 deadly confirmation that a hard core cpusa member played a key role in helping raise obama
873006 he stayed with the communist party even after the hitler stalin pact thats why i refer to him as a stalinist agent
873007 his values passed on to obama were those of a communist agent who pledged allegiance to stalin
873008 do you know the time because my watch is broken
873009 hmm but its a very complicated mechanism and your big claws will only destroy it even more
873010 oh no give it to me and it will be fixed
873011 thats ridiculous any fool knows that lazy lions with great claws cannot fix complicated watches
873012 sure they do give it to me and it will be fixed
873013 can i come and watch tv tonight with you because mine is broken
873014 you dont expect me to believe such rubbish do you
873015 thats ridiculous any fool knows that rabbits dont eat foxes
873016 you dont expect to get such rubbish published do you
873017 just wanted to let you know that kathi russ and i loved the wizards they worked out perfectly im sure well be using you again
873018 this is a like a kid out of the ghetto going to yale

873021 werent you listening didnt you hear those workers in immokalee say that they liked their jobs
873022 crops without plowing up the ground they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters
873023 the change in the prime ministers position has to do with his own perception of the political developments in the united states maliki thinks that obama is most likely to win in the presidential election and that he will withdraw his countrys troops from iraq as he pledged in his campaign
873024 hes got to take preemptive steps before obama gets to the white house
873025 we must not forget that jerusalem is a stones throw from baghdad
873026 he says that because iraq is a distraction from more important problems u s resources devoted to it must be curtailed will iraq be written off because mr obama does not consider it important enough
873027 more reassuring if mr obama were not rigidly and stubbornly maintaining his opposition to the successful surge of the past 16 months
873028 project out and to then try to plant a flag on a particular date
873029 a heck of a lot more granularity than the kind of very short hand statements that have been put out
873030 we occasionally have commanders who have so many good weeks they think its won weve got this thing well we dont weve had so many good weeks right now for example weve had two and a half months of levels of violence not since march 2004
873031 well thats encouraging its heartening its very welcome but lets keep our powder dry lets not let our guard down
873032 we know where we are trying to go we know how we think we need to try to get there with our iraqi partners and increasingly with them in the lead and shouldering more of the burden as they are
873033 but there are a lot of storm clouds out there there are lots of these possible lightning bolts you just dont know what it could be you try to anticipate them and you try to react very quickly its all there but its not something you want to lay out publicly
873034 very clearly the insurgency is in no position to overthrow the government or really even to challenge it
873035 its actually almost in no position to try to confront it by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
873036 were getting close to something that looks like an end to mass violence in iraq
873037 weve put out the forest fire now were dealing with pop up fires
873038 the improved security obviously is allowing us to move more supplies but there also has been a large increase in demand for the services
873039 the improvement in security certainly is contributing to an improvement in the reconstruction program
873040 are doing a lot of hard and important work out there
873041 i realized i was the only weird kid nobody else cared
873042 especially not young and lovely ones it is dangerous why did you do that
873043 i hope to find some salada coins i really like those i also hope to finish off my sets from the 1950s im looking to spend between 300 and 500
873044 i always try and buy 86 fleer basketball rookies and i also look for members of the baseball 500 home run club in high grade
873045 sometimes i dont buy anything because the price of admission is high and you have to pay for parking and some sellers are asking for high prices
873046 i knew it was going to be big but not quite this big
873047 i dont think ill come close to spending all my money
873048 i also left my lists at home but i need everything from the 1950s so if i can come across some deals ill be buying
873049 im trying to build some sets from the 1960s and 1970s
873050 this is my first national and i am enjoying it i came here with some co workers and we are having a great time
873051 this is like going to the best sports museum you can find
873052 you can trace the history of any sport and see rare one of a kind stuff
873053 in the past ive been to nationals where the dealers are only interested in making the sale i dont know if it is the current state of the economy but the sellers seem to be in a much friendlier mood and that is a surprise
873054 so i try and get to the national when i can
873055 one company has on display a ruth baseball hat from his barnstorming tour with gehrig
873056 i havent found a lot im buying here to resell at shows in milwaukee
873057 but i dont know if theres anyone who enjoys it more than i do
873058 it was an awesome learning experience to be surrounded by so many loving and accepting human beings
873059 je me fous de la gueule du monde et je me permets de raler en hurlant au racisme
873060 het zijn er veel geweest ik heb berekend dat mijn twee eenheden 3 000 mensen of meer hebben gedood velen van hen zijn in de rivier de cauca gegooid
873061 er zijn meer onschuldigen dan schuldigen gedood maar zo gaat dat in een oorlog
873062 je hebt kanker die zal snel je hersenen bereiken als je ons niet helpt
873063 ze vroegen informatie over mijn familie en mijn buren en zeiden dat ze me niet zouden doorlaten als ik niets zou vertellen
873064 the iraqi government broke their branches and took down their tree
873065 its almost like the old mafia criminal days in the united states
873066 we had to get our share of the cooking gas from mahdi army people
873067 now everything is available we are free to buy what we want
873068 we had no idea when they were coming or where they were going
873069 i am blind ive got a headache ive got a toothache my back hurts all of this is from the mahdi army
873070 they used to come and order us to give them 100 gas canisters
873071 then several weeks later 11 workers guards and even a director all state employees with ties to the militia were transferred to other areas
873072 i told them this isnt good they must not be blamed
873073 if your brother has been killed this is the time for revenge
873074 the sadr movement has no power now there is no militia control
873075 you still get punished if you talk bad about them
873076 the main motive is to exclude the sadr movement from politics
873077 to be honest with you i find it very slow
873078 if you could reduce these sensational attacks further i think you are almost approaching a level of normal or latent violence
873079 the fact that the levels of violence have come down so significantly and stayed down now for some two and a half months indicates there is a degree of durability
873080 al qaeda although significantly degraded still can strap a suicide vest on an individual and push him or her into a crowd of iraqis
873081 what weve got to do of course is figure out how to keep it there while over time further reducing our forces and trying to further degrade the networks that carry out the sensational attacks
873082 certainly there have been very tough days and tough reversals
873083 shes a meezer we all know how uppity they are do we really need that in the white house
873084 well of course i get stuck with the uppity meezer comment
873085 imagine the outrage if they said that about senator obama
873086 het is moeilijk om op dit moment een eerste balans op te maken maar er zijn ontelbaar veel oproepen binnengekomen vooral vanuit lamine remicourt
873087 we hebben hier wel vaker storm maar dit maken we niet vaak mee
873088 bij een weekendongeval betaalt een jongere een franchise van 250 euro na een ongeval in de week hoeft dat niet
873089 maar of dat aan de polissen ligt of aan de campagnes of de rijopleiding kunnen we niet uitmaken
873090 it is certainly our intention that we reduce troop numbers but i am not going to give an artificial timetable at the moment
873091 that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
873092 those who operate on the premise of short time periods in iraq today are being more realistic artificially prolonging the tenure of u s troops in iraq would cause problems
873093 what happened today is a national step forward to boost the governments role and take the national reconciliation ahead
873094 si je suis lu pr sident de la r publique je ferai voter d s l t 2007 une loi qui interdira la pratique d testable des golden parachutes parce que cest contraire aux valeurs qui sont les miennes
873095 je ne passerai jamais sous silence les atteintes aux droits de lhomme au nom de nos int r ts conomiques
873096 i know baby now get under the table right now
873097 if they see you with a gun theyll shoot you dead
873098 dimensions just started to collapse not just in our world something is destroying everything
873099 youve reached the tardis the doctors not here at the moment as hes off saving the universe again with a bit of a help from his friends press 1 if you have a missing planet press 2 if youre offering banana daiquiris press 3 if youre returning from a parallel universe have a brilliant day
873100 the information is somewhere on the sci fi com website i read it in one of their email newsletters there will only be four episodes next season followed by a full season of 12 episodes in 2010
873101 hamlet goes to see his dad and he turns out to be captain jack that could tie in to the whole face of boe thing somehow
873102 in torchwood they die young its dangerous youve got weevils and every week theres a major crisis and you cant keep doing that where no one on the team dies youve got to show what the stakes are and it was felt that it would be a bigger surprise and really show the higher stakes by killing two characters
873103 hamlet goes to see his dad and he turns out to be captain jack that could tie in to the whole face of boe thing somehow
873104 in torchwood they die young its dangerous youve got weevils and every week theres a major crisis and you cant keep doing that where no one on the team dies youve got to show what the stakes are and it was felt that it would be a bigger surprise and really show the higher stakes by killing two characters
873105 im an avid fan of doctor who and its great to see him running the liberal party
873106 the four aspects of the darfur situation which demand prompt and concerted action by the united nations system the african union the organization of the islamic conference the arab league and the non governmental organization community a disarmament and disbanding of the janjaweed militias who are prime agents of the genocidal violence b unhindered relief the return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes c a start of ecologically sound development for the area based on the complementary relations between agriculturalists and pastoralists d an end to impunity and a structuring of prosecution for crimes against humanity and genocide
873107 persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article iii shall be punished whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers public officials or private individuals
873108 any contracting party may call upon the competent organs of the united nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article iii
873109 the evidence of systematic actions to quote from article ii of the genocide convention
873110 first there is a reign of terror in this area second there is a scorched earth policy third there is repeated war crimes and crimes against humanity and fourth this is taking place under our eyes
873111 an old man who dies is a library which burns
873112 mechanisms of justice and accountability where they exist are under resourced politically compromised and ineffective the region is heavily armed further undercutting the rule of law and meaningful disarmament and demobilization of the janjawiid other militias and rebel movements is yet to occur darfur suffers from longstanding economic marginalizatin and underdevelopment and the conflict has resulted in further impoverishment
873113 it is true that for those who have never come to kelantan they have this perception of a taliban state with extremist muslims and a lot of racial problems where we marginalise all the other races
873114 so when they arrive in kelantan they will find that its a totally moderate state and they will find that all races are living in harmony they speak basically the same language they consider themselves kelantanese its not chinese indian malay they consider themselves kelantanese and they are very humble people they live moderately
873115 the chinese and indians can practise their own way of life
873116 so that is why we want people to come here and see this is actually what we want to portray to the people and this is actually what pas has always been saying
873117 i like staying in kelantan because its peaceful there have never been any racial riots in kelantan everyone is treated equally regardless of race chinese malay indian
873118 the problem is that we are not given the opportunity to appear in the mainstream newspaper
873119 that is why we really want people to come here and see but now we have an alternative media for example through the internet but the problem with the internet is that there are some quarters of people who do not have access to the internet however it cannot be denied that this medium has played a great role in the recent election
873120 if you take kelantan for example the penetration of internet services is not that high actually
873121 they convey back whatever they have read from the internet to the people even to the old folks who dont bother to browse the internet on what are the issues being brought up and resolved over the internet
873122 we would like to have our services being watched by a wide audience we are thinking of having our infrastructure built up and going into iptv kind of things where you can watch events from your normal tv rather than using computers we hope to see that before the end of the year
873123 actually pas has been the ruling party since 1951 until now except from 1978 to 1990
873124 they have brought all the good things to the kelantanese and also set a very good example for all malaysians whereby pas is a good government and can govern the state very well compared to barisan nasional
873125 talking about the population of kelantan weve got a population of 1 5 million and out of that 3 7 percent is chinese and if assuming that pas is what people think then this 3 7 percent of the chinese should move out of kelantan state but instead more chinese are coming in
873126 actually for the past few years ive invited all the people especially the chinese groups to come to kelantan and visit this state and find out why the chinese in kelantan support pas so much compared to other states
873127 pas is equal and fair to everybody whether you are chinese indian or malay you have the same opportunity
873128 even in business the state government issues a licence to everybody who can fulfil the laws in the state so there have been no complaints no memorandum has being sent by the chinese or indian community to the state government to demand for their rights
873129 in kelantan barisan nasional lost badly in the last election but all hope is not lost we are moving quickly to remedy the situation we know where we went wrong and god willing we hope to regain the lost ground as soon as we can so we have to work hard
873130 i think kelantan is a bit of a special case and i dont think they can actually be compared to the other states in the same way because i think kelantanese are generally very parochial
873131 and i know part of the campaigning was this idea that outsiders were going to come in and take it over and therefore every single kelantanese sort of banded together and said no way so unless they do get a credible alternative kelantanese government nothing is going to change there in terms of who rules it
873132 they said we couldnt leave when violence was up they say we cant leave when violence is down
873133 we leave iraq to a government that is taking responsibility for its future a government that prevents sectarian conflict and ensures that the al qaeda threat which has been beaten back by our troops does not reemerge
873134 if you want to play here ill give you something else to play with
873135 no hitting here ill play with it if you dont want to
873136 if you scream or throw one more thing i am going to spank you
873137 you need to calm down so we can talk with you
873138 the mother and the fa ahther the mother and the fa ahther
873139 shes been to the beach and a movie today shes over indulged
873140 shes been to the beach and a movie today shes ungrateful
873141 shes been to the beach and a movie today shes exhausted
873142 oh honey im sorry too do you want me to heat up some of these noodles with butter and salt
873143 shes been to the beach and a movie today shes exhausted
873144 have not reached the political accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge
873145 political accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge
873146 the place for the greatest battle of islam in this era
873147 im sorry i am being so mean you see my eye teeth are coming in
873148 in terms of technology there are long spinning ball bearings in them theyre perfectly rim weighted for optimal spin time theyre made out of aircraft grade aluminum or titanium old wooden or even plastic yo yos might spin for seconds standard yo yos today spin for minutes
873149 but also to spread the yo yo love the joy the passion to everyone who doesnt know about it
873150 you do not have sufficient permissions to access this page
873151 no one has told me that 20 000 or 30 000 more troops would help in iraq it may even do the opposite
873152 they say they want to get into battle until they do and then they wont want it anymore
873153 he spends 20 days at a time camped out in the mountains and the taliban come engage them in serious firefights
873154 hey buddy need a couple of hundred thou for a house
873155 i served for two years on the freddie mac loan prospector advisory committee
873156 they claimed it was so they could hear from bankers and brokers about what they could do with not only their automated underwriting decision but how freddie could improve
873157 we as a group came up with many ideas yet the real reason we met in places like new orleans and the ritz in suburban washington was to promote their agenda
873158 they sent an armada of their people to the meetings and never really considered what we had to say
873159 during the peak of the bubble frenzy people would always ask me just how bad it could get
873160 i always said that some major bank failures and either bankruptcies or takeovers of some large home builders to possibly be followed by a federal bailout of the gses government sponsored enterprises would be the worst case scenario that scenario has now arrived
873161 if joe and jane taxpayer are going to be asked to bail them out during their time of peril they should also be able to participate and be rewarded in their future recovery
873162 what is going on is that a realistic view of the role of regulation has finally sunk in at the federal reserve the subprime problem was not unknown there but the attitude was that the markets could handle it
873163 well they cant so we will likely see a lot more regulatory activity in the housing and financial markets
873164 i am currently involved with one specific deal where the appraiser has insisted on making three return trips to the condo being financed and is still contending that minor touch up paint and tile work be completed before he gives the ok for the bank to release or sign off on the loan
873165 agents and sellers previously insulated from the changing financial landscape
873166 are starting to get the idea that this crisis is in fact going to affect them
873167 immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq he will remove one to two combat brigades each month and have all of our combat brigades out of iraq within 16 months
873168 instead of any time based approach to any decision for withdrawal its got to be conditions based with the starting point being an intelligence analysis of what might be here today and what might lie ahead in the future i still think we still have work that remains to be done before i can really answer that question
873169 its very dangerous ill speak for the coalition forces men and women of character and moral courage we have a mission and its not until the mission is done that i can look my leader in the eye and say sir maam mission accomplished and i think it is dangerous to leave anything a little early
873170 id have to see the entire plan id have to understand the strategic objectives of the leadership and based on those strategic objectives come up with operational objectives its very difficult to comment on one way or the other whether one plan would work or one plan wouldnt work right now we are helping the iraqis achieve sustainable security and helping them to increase the capability of the iraqi security forces and we are making great progress along those lines
873171 if we pull out of here too early its going to establish a vacuum of power that violent criminal groups will be able to fill once we leave
873172 the same people keep coming back because we want to see iraq succeed thats what we want i dont want my kids that hopefully will join the military my notional children to have to come back to iraq 30 years from now and wear this
873173 you cant put a timetable on it its events based
873174 we have the capacity to do a minimum of two and a half brigade combat teams a month can we expand that capacity sure can we accelerate it depends it depends on the amount of equipment that we bring back and its going to depend on how fast we bring them out
873175 do you want to surrender to the whims of a
873176 i knew the mob wouldnt go down without a fight but theyve crossed a line
873177 you squeezed them you hammered them to the point of desperation and in their desperation they turned to a man they didnt fully understand
873178 some men arent looking for anything logical like money they cant be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn
873179 look what i have done to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple bullets
873180 lets give him what he wants and maybe hell go away
873181 leave the iraqis to the prospect of mass slaughter and genocide at the hands of al qaeda and other various islamic death cults
873182 i know what i have to become to stop men like him
873183 understands that there is no moral equivalence between a free society in which people sometimes make the wrong choices and a criminal sect bent on destruction the former must be cherished even in its moments of folly the latter must be hounded to the gates of hell
873184 left and right all americans know that freedom is better than slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
873185 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
873186 people are dying alfred what would you have me do
873187 theyll hate you for it but thats the point of batman he can be the outcast he can make the choice that no one else can make the right choice
873188 soon the security forces will be in diyala to play the role they played in basra and maysan and mosul and diyala could be the last stage
873189 we can see in a very short period of time the iraqi security forces will reach self reliance we can relax the requirements for foreign troops in this country
873190 iraqis must know when the american and other forces will leave iraqi land it is our right to know and know the truth of where the situation stands if there is an intention for american forces to leave or not
873191 what do you think are the responsibilities of designers today
873192 not softening his criticism of the surge we regularly update the web site to reflect changes in current events
873193 the major point here is that sen obama refuses to acknowledge that he was wrong
873194 theyre here so fast i think thats a big thing
873195 its kind of hard to maintain a constant temperature with the meat we just use as much charcoal as we possibly can
873196 i look forward to it every year because the food is so good
873197 its no secret that we get a lot of complaints in there and we are using national night out to send a clear message
873198 the message is the neighborhood and police department have organized and we will fight back
873199 we have been a part of this event and are maintaining the tradition that was started in the past
873200 its also a great way to create relationships between the community and the police force
873201 ive got enough money and im in a leadership role
873202 what i have to do is appeal to voters common sense and ask them if with the state in the condition its in is something wrong here
873203 he cant be doing a great job if the states in a mess
873204 i knew rep washington was going to have quite a bit of money and i knew angelo running against an incumbent was going to have trouble raising money
873205 this practice is really about organization building and safeguarding your fortress as the boss of the area
873206 this doesnt look like a good investment even to my best friends
873207 i found her diary underneath a tree and started reading about me
873208 not softening his criticism of the surge we regularly update the web site to reflect changes in current events
873209 the major point here is that sen obama refuses to acknowledge that he was wrong
873210 the stated purpose of the surge was to enable iraqs political leaders to reconcile they have not done so our troops fight and die in the 120 degree heat to give iraqs leaders space to agree but they are not filling it the bar for success is so low that it is almost buried in the sand
873211 iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders and the government will have the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas
873212 dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
873213 lindsays new album spirit in the dark is out in november so i wouldnt be surprised if its around then
873214 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
873215 the primacy of the peace process remains to be on top of our priorities
873216 but these attacks could not just be allowed to go on rest assured our troops will continue to protect the people from similar hostilities
873217 we can give you about the biggest room in the house
873218 and we can give it to you for half the regular room rate what do you think about that
873219 were not using the conference room until noon tomorrow so if you boys dont might bunking down there and can be out about 11 i think we can put you in there ill have a couple of rollaways moved in for you oh and by the way theres a few bikers here for the rodeo they needed a place too dont mind if they share the room do you and another thing theres no bathroom so you can use the public bathroom down the hall theres no shower or bathtub but you can splash around in the sink all you want as long as youre out by 7 am ill be off duty by then so ill need your word of honor and another thing we cant supply soap or towels but you can use one of the pillow cases when you wake up you can probably get some soap from housekeeping when they get here at 6 something else we cant give you a wakeup call cause theres no phone in the conference room so ill leave a note for housekeeping to rattle the door early for you that be ok
873220 sprained my ankle last night in the trials cant get inta my boots these here things are my daughters not bad either whadduya think
873221 well we have one maybe the guy hasnt shown up and the room isnt made up and i dont know if
873222 i just made up the room the sheets are clean but i havent vacuumed
873223 newish place near the water i cant vouch for it nobody i know has stayed there
873224 can you tell me where i might find a restaurant thats open i know its nearly nine oclock
873225 you dont know any restaurants or you dont know any that might be open
873226 maybe you could suggest a restaurant and we could call them
873227 how would i know i dont know what restaurants there are here in port townsend i thought you might know some
873228 ok then perhaps you have a list of restaurants somewhere
873229 so do you know any that serve seafood these are just names
873230 thats ok i just wondered if you might know which of these restaurants serve fish perhaps local fish
873231 its not a kind of fish i just mean fish that is caught in the waters around here
873232 whats the nearest place on this list do you think
873233 i dont see the name on this list do they serve fish
873234 theyre just down the street theres a big blue sign out front well not on the front sort of on the side
873235 how far down the street and which side i dont see too well in the dark
873236 it says surf n turn on the sign is that what you want
873237 youll find just the kind of country road youre looking for its route 30 lots of bends and curves and hills and youll love the countryside thats the way my husband and i go when we go to the good sam for samaritan i later learned hospital down to portland we dont have to go there too often knock wood but we do like the drive i think you will too i dont go in the hospital i just stay in the car my husband goes in hes good though hes just moved too many pianos in his life i used to help him but were both a little too old now now did you eat lunch yet well you go just down the road there to the shelburne inn theres a good restaurant there called i think shoalwaters youll like it and then you be sure to come right back here and tell me if you liked it because if you didnt then im not going to tell any more good folks to go there
873238 the desserts i had a piece of berry pie were about a quarter of the normal size of a slice of pie seems i got cheated
873239 you didnt they only charge a quarter of the normal price since they figure people dont need all that much dessert anyhow
873240 now i cant stand here talking all day with you theres other folks who have questions i was in new york city once a couple of years ago and you talk about getting cheated we paid more than 5 for a ham sandwich and you should have seen the people we saw walking around im not going back now if youll excuse me
873241 oke hij zit nu achterin de bus hij hakt stukken af en eet ze op
873242 we mogen dan niet al onze problemen hebben opgelost maar de stukken liggen op het bord
873243 aleksander solzjenitsyn behoort tot het pantheon van de wereldgeschiedenis zijn onbuigzaamheid zijn idealen en lange en veelbewogen leven maken solzjenitsyn een sprookjesfiguur erfgenaam van dostojevski
873244 het was aleksander solzjenitsyn die de ogen van de wereld opende voor de realiteit van het sowjet systeem daarmee kregen zijn ervaringen universeel bereik
873245 het is voor het eerst in de geschiedenis dat we op grote schaal succes hebben in het bevechten van deze epidemie
873246 we beginnen aan een nieuwe fase met nieuwe en langdurige uitdagingen
873247 dit is een epidemie die niet vergeeft we zijn voor de lange termijn betrokken
873248 je hebt mensen nodig die in de zorg werken om medicijnen uit te delen zonder die mensen zijn medicijnen nutteloos
873249 il estdifficile de dresser un premier bilan cette heure mais les appels laide sont innombrables nous sommes notamment tr s sollicit s dans la r gion de lamine remicourt
873250 i want to help the u s because the u s first helped me in 91
873251 everybodys happy because everybodys coming to a class for citizenship
873252 persecution of anyone because of race religion national origin political opinion or social group
873253 good moral character requirement according to the web site for u s citizenship and immigration services
873254 i told my wife i want to go to army for one year two year or three year
873255 but my wife tells me you not citizen you cant go
873256 its a great opportunity to take advantage of the savings
873257 we have a really good response for our free opening days
873258 as far as a facility of this type we are the only one i know of in this area
873259 we offer an opportunity for kids and their families to play and learn together in a fun environment
873260 i dont know how many people have a tarantula and a fire bellied toad outside their kitchen window but we do
873261 its a great place for the kids to interact with other kids and learn about various subjects
873262 it changes by age last year we were at face painting and now were at the puzzles it kind of grows with the child
873263 i like to believe that we all play very important roles
873264 we were very fortunate it was in and out within a matter of minutes it wasnt anything that lingered
873265 the majority were power lines telephone lines down a lot of trees down some structural damage a roof was blown off a structure
873266 we were assisted by shenandoah volunteer and grottoes just due to the number of calls we didnt have the apparatus to answer them alone
873267 our maintenance crew was in within 15 to 20 minutes of the storm we had a pretty good handle on clearing roads everyone seemed to react very fast

873461 midway through lunch one day a young woman asked me if i noticed a difference between the writing of men and the writing of women the answer is no but its a good question a writers fundamental problem once her prose is under control is shaping and understanding her own authority ive often noticed a habit of polite self negation among my female students a self deprecatory way of talking that is meant i suppose to help create a sense of shared space a shared social connection it sounds like the language of constant apology and the form i often hear is the sentence that begins my problem is even though this way of talking is conventional and perhaps socially placating it has a way of defining a young writer a young woman in negative terms as if she were basically incapable and always giving offense you simply cannot pretend that the words you use about yourself have no meaning why not i asked be as smart and perceptive as you really are why not accept what youre capable of why not believe that what you notice matters
873462 perhaps the world will punish them for this confidence perhaps their self possession will chase away everyone who cant accept it for what it is which may not be a terrible thing but whenever i see this transformation a young woman suddenly understanding the power of her perceptions ready to look at the world unapologetically i realize how much has been lost because of the culture of polite self negating silence in which they were raised
873463 stop id like to make you feel better right about now

873598 coming on top of the proteas most successful season ever this is the most wonderful start to a new era for south african cricket
873599 it was most fitting that graeme smith led the proteas to this historic victory and his innings proved that he is really captain colossus
873600 the vision of cricket south africa is to grow the game in all communities and to be the best cricket nation in the world
873601 the series victory against england showed that we are on the right road to achieve this vision
873602 in many ways it is a great pity that we are not at home to share this moment with all south africans
873603 it is a great moment for the team as an away series win in england was one of the targets we had set ourselves along with the away series in australia and the one in india which we drew
873604 but if you look at the bigger picture this is a huge result for our country
873605 we think of those who came before us and tried so hard to achieve this victory of those who never had the opportunity to achieve it and of course of all our fans
873606 we went to england twice in 1994 and 1998 got a lead and then lost it drawing 1 1 in the first and losing 2 1 in the second
873607 it was always my dream to go to england and beat them there so im really proud of this teams performance particularly in view of the circumstances
873608 when they lost those four wickets so quickly they looked dead and buried so it was a terrific effort to go on and win from there
873609 he went out there and led from the front he was absolutely outstanding south africa were clearly the better team but its not always easy to convert your superiority into victories graemes team have done that and im really proud of them
873610 to chase a total of 280 was difficult enough but to come back and win after losing those wickets represented an incredible comeback irrespective of how strong the england team happens to be its always difficult to win there they never give much away at home

873629 all solzhenitsyns great work was instigated by his experience of tyranny personal freedom once he got it didnt give him a lot to write about that was i suppose because in his way he was a creation of the soviet system that was his subject matter

873632 most of the times i mean you look at montezuma they have a 20 8 record most of the time 20 8 comes close to running away with it its hard to believe that it took 26 wins to get it but were glad that we did
873633 but after i think about that fifth inning i started stepping up and throwing the ball a little better when were good i throw the ball down the plate and i dont try to take everything myself i just try to adjust to where theyre hitting the ball let them hit it to somebody when people make plays like that we have no errors thats just fantastic its so easy on me
873634 my mentality with him is just sit fastball and try to hit it the other way
873635 he gave me something basically middle maybe a smidge out i was just trying to hit it the other way and i really put some good wood on it

873655 its not good for him personally hopefully in the next couple of days we have two days tomorrow and tuesday to see how he feels

873657 it felt fine said linebrink previously singled out by ozzie guillen as the white sox mvp in the first half
873658 im definitely going to have to work through some stuff weve given it seven days to heal because it was muscular and hopefully that was the time it needed now its just a matter of kind of stretching it back out
873659 i didnt throw for seven days so obviously its not going to feel 100 percent when you go out there and start playing catch
873660 its a process i was encouraged by today versus yesterday so as long as we keep showing steady improvement like that i think well be all right
873661 i grew up in florida so this kind of weather doesnt bother me pierzynski said

873664 if youre not going to hit home runs youve got to hit doubles and triples

873666 i want to use the time to show i can play
873667 i just want to play good baseball and hope that people see i can i play hard too and i dont want that to be overlooked
873668 its a great sign every day well add to it build it up
873669 but i had a better angle on it looking at the sun and those straight up and straight down balls can be a little tough
873670 the ball was coming right into the sun and it wasnt going to be easy
873671 i could make the play but i was thankful that bryan was there when the first baseman or the third baseman has the angle like that its better for them to take the ball because they dont have to battle the sun so much

873707 it should be a national scandal that here our men and women in uniform who are protecting our freedom who are exposing themselves to harm are being denied the most basic civil right and that is the right to vote
873708 i think its really a lack of focus and attention by the federal government
873709 and i think the department of defense bares a special responsibility and my legislations designed to see them discharge it to make sure that those votes count
873710 this is something that if most americans knew existed the current dismal state of actual opportunity to see your vote count for our men and women in uniform they would be up in arms
873711 i think we have a significant responsibility to encourage our men and women in uniform to vote and to enable them to vote and so this is a high priority and your question prompts me to go find out if things are on track as i have been told they are in terms of making sure that we have the ballots and things available for our for our troops

873736 in conjunction with other economic data released in recent months the job advertisements series provides further evidence that the current level of interest rates is achieving the rbas desired slowing in domestic economic growth he said
873737 there will be scope for the reserve bank to take its foot off the brake he said
873738 we worked so hard and put so much into it a qc and barrister doing it pro bono without charge
873739 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
873740 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
873741 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the the western australian liberal party
873742 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
873743 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
873744 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
873745 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
873746 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
873747 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
873748 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
873749 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
873750 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
873751 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it
873752 so does that mean you can insert crazy use of lambda expressions here
873753 my parents say it doesnt look like im affected on the field
873754 i say you taught me that show no weakness i played football i know how to pick and choose my battles when im hurt sometimes i grimace but i try not to show it
873755 thats something thats coming just wait i can see that happening just a matter of time
873756 i can see myself being that type of person one day thats the key to the game driving guys in being a run producer we need someone like that on our team
873757 we think its a great opportunity to not only build loyalty with our current subscribers but really a great new reason for consumers to take a look at starz if they dont currently subscribe
873758 giving them something unique and exclusive thats only on starz is really the reason that we entered into the original business in a bigger way
873759 this is an opportunity for people to take another look at starz that may not be aware of starz
873760 and i think the fact that people will be writing about this because it is a new series is a nice throwback to help the brand recognition as well
873761 the fact that were launching with crash which is based on the film is really the perfect original drama to launch with for us
873762 it makes a lot of sense to our consumers and a lot of the reaction weve gotten doing research is go for it theres not an issue with consumers to not think of starz as providing original series the more the better for them
873763 i think that its important to broaden our base beyond the current base of people that see starz today
873764 its really an opportunity for them to deliver it to their consumers so that they can get excited about the episodes get excited about the series and then tune in and watch if they have it or upgrade if they dont have it
873765 weve got marketing material to promote those sneak peeks as well as its baked into our campaign during the fall time period along with our movies
873766 a great opportunity to not only make people aware that crash exists only on starz but also to click them through to that streamed episode
873767 on the television side were really looking at the theatrical model of a big burst up to the premiere
873768 the plan calls for a combination of national cable broadcast and local cable targeting key markets
873769 we believe this is a show that people will talk about it addresses some pretty serious issues head on
873770 if people dont have starz today were going to give them a nice little incentive to use this as the occasion to sign up
873771 huh i didnt know that although now that i do its probably not that important
873772 youre inviting me to take shots of my own alcohol
873773 look at me im too brilliant to bothering getting a haircut or combing my hair
873774 there was pretty heavy opposition for it i dont know that anything could change
873775 it was designed to be a capital program to enhance the public transportation system not as an operating subsidy

873781 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it
873782 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision
873783 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
873784 wow how does it cost it must be spent a lot of money
873785 we also find a potentially alarming degree of past performance chasing momentum
873786 commodity indices are somewhat peculiar in that they allow investors a long term view of commodities through short term rolling instruments
873787 the real slowdown began in may as the industrial production data shows around the same time tightening of monetary policy also started we will see the impact in the next quarter considerably lower sales and net profit growth

873870 learning curve for the chinese on what we really need when youre an organizing committee you set up and you have all of this planned for then we waltz in and say thats great well utilize that but we need this as well they werent fully prepared and didnt have an understanding of why we would need that
873871 sometimes at the beginning of practice theres a little bit of a negotiation getting going but once it gets going it gets going very well
873872 im constantly raising the bar whether that is thinking about the olympics or thinking about the next personal best i want to hit

873877 apparently gen y are much like baby boomers and are referred to as
873878 suppose i paid you for every pound of pollution you generated and punished you for every pound you reduced you would probably spend most of your time trying to figure out how to generate more pollution
873879 cost effective energy efficiency improvements could achieve approximately one seventh of the greenhouse gas emission reductions required to reduce australian emissions to 30 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020
873880 economic models greatly overestimate the cost of carbon mitigation because economists simply dont believe that the economy has lots of high return energy efficiency opportunities in their theory the economy is always operating near efficiency
873881 the new owners sacked thousands of secv workers and decimated the coal towns built in the latrobe valley to service the industry
873882 only small change from the 28 billion from the capital windfall from the sale found its way back into the valley to deal with the regional social and economic problems created
873883 we are observing only very small rebound effects if any at all in the united states
873884 were writing to let you know that youve just reached 75 of your usage allowance for your standard rate power allocation this is a reminder that when you reach 100 you will be billed triple the standard rate
873885 energy efficiency is a common sense strategy for reducing carbon emissions
873886 heres an example energy efficiency in other words what to do with the electricity we already have
873887 requiring polluters to clean up their emissions improve their emission control technology sequester their emissions whatever and pollute less
873888 meanwhile that the rest of us consume less you know only ten times the average third world consumption rate
873889 alternative forms of energy be funded from pollution taxes permit fees etc
873890 that vast areas be put under plantations of natives and high value timber trees to suck co2 out of the atmosphere especially in the north particularly by aboriginal people on aboriginal land
873891 that far more extensive rail networks be built funded partly through the above to take trucks off the road and smaller cars preferably electric and improved and heavily fare subsidised from the above public transport systems be re introduced

873899 weve just got a great mix of things and activities
873900 we really think we fit the population of sioux falls with the diversity and the activities that we have youre just not gonna get that anywhere else in town
873901 it seems like people tend to think if they put it in the water itll never be seen again but with the training the equipment that ourselves and other teams have its not always true
873902 im sure plenty of evidence has gone in the river in the past and its just been an overlooked thing youre not going to get it back
873903 two three years ago we went on quite a few dive calls and so far things have been slow we havent been called out this season since the first of the year so this is good for morale
873904 there was no qualm about it it wasnt about money
873905 it wasnt about anything other than youre having a bad crime were coming to help you and they werent asking me for money they werent asking me for anything they did the good neighbor policy and theyre here to help me for free
873906 my first year my average was about 30 my second year was average about 25 now this year is averaged about 18
873907 why dont i do two lemonades and then heres a tip for you
873908 ive got to run back to my house and get some cash
873909 we have carefully chosen a little boy for you named allan agaba we met this little sweet guy in a poor island village
873910 he started going through all the couch cushions and everywhere he could find throughout the house to find loose change and we were still four dollars short
873911 i was too worried that he wouldnt live that he would die if we didnt get the right amount of support in
873912 he does everything himself makes all the lemonade himself hell go bike over to kesslers to buy the cups or supplies by himself

873918 oh god if i should forget jerusalem let my right hand forget its cunning
873919 the fact of the matter is the security barrier has brought suicide bombings down to virtually zero and it isnt even complete yet
873920 israel and the disputed territories of the west bank and gaza strip
873921 they the israelis are doing a better job than their neighbouring countries
873922 if we want to play silly games my daddys bigger than your daddy weve been here longer than you etc lets remember that ancient philistia or falestin was well and truly occupied long before the hebrews straggled out of the desert and settled in what is now the west bank
873923 can muslims now accept the fact other faiths are now back living amongst them for good and that they may never again rule the majority of the land that was once known as palestine and now after accepting both those political and religious facts concentrate their political struggle on installing a safe secure secular government in what litttle bit of palestine they have left rather than failing to recognise the rights and faith of others
873924 i am suggesting that there will be no lasting peace until it is achieved
873925 there will be no lasting peace until both parties establish a colony on mars working in harmony with one another to sustain inter planetary life
873926 as far as the palestinians are concerned since after all many of them come from what is now israel their homelands are there their houses are there their farms and cemeteries and memories are there
873927 to achieve it each side will have to drop its religious argument since that of each party is exclusive of the other
873928 canaan and the disputed territories of the west bank and gaza strip
873929 this is exactly what i have been trying to say that one side wants a one state solution by pushing the other into the sea and it cannot be supported neither can a similar push to expel palestinians from their homeland and to keep those expelled out

873932 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
873933 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
873934 i thought this was an opportunity to combine everything ive known
873935 its an entrepreneurial company a big complex company and its a very heavily real estate driven company for me its an opportunity to be partners with a great entrepreneur like sunrise co founder paul klaassen
873936 everything i have done is operationally intensive i also surround myself with very good operators
873937 wwe and i parted on the best of terms this gives me the chance to pursue new opportunities corporate speaking engagements product sponsorships autograph shows for my loyal fans who made me what i am today and film and television roles my agent and i are very excited about what the future holds
873938 until the fed starts scaling back or eliminating its special liquidity providing measures rate hikes would create a glaring policy inconsistency conducting measures that effectively lower borrowing rates while simultaneously raising them
873939 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time

873970 we got rid of cronyism kick backs and sweetheart deals
873971 under certain circumstances companies can rely on their websites and blogs to meet the public disclosure requirements under fair disclosure according to new guidance unanimously approved by the us securities and exchange commission today

873977 the second quarter of 2008 proved to be another very challenging quarter for the banking industry
873978 the environment continued to affect the performance of our investment banking business but our stable businesses again proved their resilience despite additional markdowns we produced a solid profit
873979 looking forward we remain cautious for the remainder of 2008 we will continue to strictly manage cost risk and capital and to reduce our exposures in key areas we will continue to invest in all our core businesses both organically and by acquisition but we will not relax our discipline
873980 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets

873985 essentially this is a loan administered through the tax code
873986 i question whether the tax code is the best way to do this
873987 it does pain me to allow something that has been abused by certain folks to let that go on another year
873988 in my mind things have been broken for a while and its about time we fixed the problem
873989 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac
873990 the oddity of the situation is if the debt is backed by the government then it might be impossible to imagine how the companies might ever fail
873991 this is no time to pull the liquidity rug out from under financial companies
873992 were still only two thirds of the way through earnings season so people will be focused on that
873993 generally investors have felt relieved that the earnings have continued to be better than expected realizing of course that the bar had been set awfully low
873994 consumers are getting more cautious and the credit crunch is far from over
873995 should be better able to predict how their decisions and actions will affect their costs
873996 yes the card issuers want to collect finance charges but they dont want their customers to be delinquent
873997 weve never before seen the industry start to reach out to their customers saying we know youre hurting
873998 you want people to think well of you dont you
873999 right about now there are a lot of workplaces that could use some laughter the national unemployment rate in may increased a full percentage point to 5 5 percent compared with may 2007 before leveling off last month layoffs from the auto to housing industries have decimated companies and morale
874000 why help someone who is going to turn around and do the same thing once the economy turns around
874001 so in spite of having the gift of levity i find i have to move on frequently to other offices to avoid negative backwash over simply having fun with the people i work with
874002 i didnt work my tail off to save that money just to lose it in a bad investment
874003 theres a lot of vulnerability out there and we need to remain vigilant
874004 the order is designed to protect legitimate short selling in these securities but helps prevent illegitimate naked short selling and potential distort and short manipulation
874005 this orders seems to have dampened the volatility in many of the financial stocks
874006 expanding the requirement to pre borrow for every one of the thousands and thousands of publicly traded companies would involve serious operational challenges not to mention a likely impact on liquidity and market performance all of which we are still quantifying
874007 we cant afford not to invest in some major initiatives such as health and energy and middle class tax cuts
874008 and we also cant afford not to pay for those initiatives
874009 whoever becomes the next president will have a very very sobering first week in office
874010 theres a total disconnect between todays report and what were hearing on the campaign trail
874011 i remember it vividly ellis said recently after lions training camp practice
874012 we raced twice and in the first one everybody said it was a tie i won the second one
874013 we didnt have any money we were rookies and they werent paying us anything but there were some side bets
874014 shaun said he was the fastest and other people said i was faster and it came down to an old fashioned foot race
874015 the nfl is all about competition and ive never been one scared of competition ellis said
874016 i was a tryout guy and i couldve tried out for other teams but i wanted to come to the lions it was a challenge to me
874017 i thought id be back in a couple of weeks and then i find out its a three month injury and i was pushing on it and making it worse ellis said
874018 camp was only a couple of weeks away and i tried to get back so i could return punts and kicks and i did more damage
874019 you look around the league and you know how guys make a team and if you want to last a long time youve got to play special teams he said
874020 and i pride myself on playing gunner on punt coverage
874021 we seem to be in the midst of a perfect storm leading to more bankruptcies high levels of debt high energy and raw materials costs and weakness in the u s economy
874022 theres always the hope that this might be the last big financial blowup
874023 some people think we may be getting toward the end in terms of large write downs
874024 i think with oil at around the 120 area that is giving the market a psychological uplift today
874025 the availability of affordable mortgage financing is essential to turning the corner on the current housing correction
874026 we are at the early stages of what should be a promising path where the nascent u s covered bond market can grow and provide a new source of mortgage financing
874027 it remains to be seen whether the current restrictions and inherent execution costs on covered bonds will allow the vehicle to become a viable substitute for alternatives
874028 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

874032 the sale of the substantial majority of our cdo positions represents a significant milestone in our risk reduction efforts
874033 our consistent focus has been to opportunistically reduce risk and in order to take advantage of this sizable sale on an accelerated basis we have decided to further enhance our capital position by issuing common stock

874042 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperature and other weather conditions from those records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
874043 british archives contain more than 100 000 royal navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone they are a stunning resource
874044 it means we can deduce numerical values for wind strength and direction temperature and rainfall
874045 global warming is a reality but what our data shows is that climate science is complex and that it is wrong to take particular events and link them to co2 emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening
874046 a lot of people were disappointed to come and find snowy meadows

874048 that nitrogen plays a large role in the changes to the phytoplankton community composition

874050 if were truly going to be the city we promote ourselves to be a world class 21st century city that advances its values and principles were going to have to try new things
874051 people are used to doing things a certain way and when you change that they say it cant be done well weve proved them wrong
874052 at the moment we have a missed opportunity which is that were at a 70 percent recycling rate overnight we could be at 92 percent if everything people are throwing away that could be reused or recycled actually was
874053 if they want to throw away food thats their right
874054 do we want our garbage collectors to be the meter maids of trash
874055 good luck placing blame on the recycling criminal especially in big apartment buildings i will stop recycling if this law goes into effect just to become an eventual test case dictators are anathema no matter which side of the political spectrum they come from
874056 we support the goals of the proposed ordinance but believe it needs refinements to be workable for everyone involved especially the customers
874057 we are concerned about draft provisions that envision our drivers policing the contents of refuse containers and possibly withholding service if violations were found
874058 a significant increase in time required to service each customer location would mean we would need to have more routes which means more drivers trucks fuel and related resources
874059 or do we indiscriminately start fining all tenants for one tenants poor choice of judgment
874060 we wont enforce against owners of apartment buildings if their tenants dont do this
874061 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
874062 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
874063 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
874064 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
874065 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
874066 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

874100 ive watched adrian since he was at oklahoma and to me hes an inspiration
874101 hes a different type of back than i would say i am but when i watch him and i see him make moves and do things on that level i have no doubt that i can do that on this level
874102 he had a big college career and me im coming off last years big performance if i did anything but something similar to what he did last year for me it will be a disappointment

874110 at the moment a bottom for the housing market is not visible
874111 corporate depositors and individual depositors are looking at balances at individual financial institutions i think thats unsettling some of the banks

874124 i would go on record now and pick bolt for 3 golds in beijing

874133 serious controversy ensued but i had thought about it a great deal beforehand it was the product of serious frustration
874134 this is a provocation created especially to remove potential medalists before the olympics
874135 you can understand people who are using dramatic terms like provocation and conspiracy until now international sport especially the olympics has been free from politics
874136 my big aim will be to make the final in beijing she said i have really put my heart and soul into it this year

874208 this is a smart low risk move for the pistons it might not work out but it cant possibly be a disaster the pistons didnt use the no 1 overall pick on brown like the wizards did they did not trade all star caron butler for him like the lakers did they just offered him 4 million a year for one or two years thats a lot of money to you and me but nba owners find that kind of cash in the seat cushions of their corporate jets kwame brown is a young strong athletic 6 foot 11 player with limited ball skills he never should have been the no 1 overall pick but he has a place in the nba brown gives the pistons another usable piece he has the size and defensive ability to fill in when rasheed wallace and antonio mcdyess get in foul trouble
874209 oh believe me gmac joe is a pussy hes too buddy buddy with these players to trade em
874210 a league source tells wdfns matt dery that the pistons are close to signing second round pick walter sharpe to a two year contract sharpe was the teams first of three second round picks out of uab also wdfn has learned that the pistons have offered will bynum a one year deal to be their third point guard bynum played very well for the pistons summer league team in las vegas
874211 detroit could this be why artest was so interested in interviewing brawl instigator john green a while back it would be a brilliant pr move if the pistons were looking to put a package together for artest and from what i was told from one source close to the pistons they are ive yet to get this info from more than one person so stay tuned but much like the mavs situation this could be one of those where the player the kings want perhaps tayshaun prince would be different than the one offered jason maxiell anyone pure speculation on my part in terms of the potential pieces
874212 if you go back to the brawl thats a culture issue right there
874213 before you reply i can already tell what your going to say either im gay for liking tayshaun or im stupid either way your age shows
874214 steve and richie you sound like such idiots no one cares how many jerseys you have
874215 a team source confirmed the pistons did approach the atlanta hawks weeks ago about a possible sign and trade deal involving restricted free agent small forward josh smith but said sunday that the two teams havent talked in weeks the source indicated the hawks were asking for too much and both sides walked away from any possible deal
874216 still multiple league sources confirmed sunday night that despite no sign and trade offer on the table between the two teams detroit remains very interested in the 22 year old restricted free agent
874217 ive always said that when arron plays consistent minutes he shoots the ball consistently
874218 youre always glad to see everyone play well but especially aaron because of how much time he puts in to improve his game hes going to be our backup 2 guard this season so we expect him to come in and play consistent minutes each night and hell be a good contributor for us
874219 kwame browns agent mark bartlestein told espn com on monday night that the former no 1 pick in the 2001 draft has reached a verbal agreement on a new contract with the detroit pistons
874220 oh joe could have traded these two guys since the rockets got him for those two guys
874221 i would rather have kwame killpatrick sit on my head and tell me how good of a mayor he really is
874222 free agent forward jarvis hayes plans to sign a two year contract with the new jersey nets a league source with knowledge of the negotiations said
874223 surprised to see jarvis dressed instead of amir and even more surprised to see hayes get time on court
874224 the fundamental reason social security must be reformed is that the benefits promised to the public have a present value that is 13 6 trillion greater than the present value of the revenues that the system is projected to receive
874225 why must the system increase net receipts by 13 6 trillion if it is already requiring current and future workers to pay in more than they will receive the answer relates to the systems generosity to early birth cohorts generations of workers now either retired or deceased social security paid these previous cohorts benefits that exceeded their lifetime contributions by more than 13 6 trillion
874226 subtracting the current value of the trust fund the accumulated value of past oasdi taxes less cost gives a closed group excluding all future participants unfunded obligation of 15 2 trillion this value represents the shortfall of lifetime contributions for all past and current participants relative to the lifetime costs associated with their generations
874227 social security has turned out to be strongly redistributionist but only because of its ponzi game aspect in which each generation takes more out than it put in
874228 well the ponzi game will soon be over thanks to changing demographics so that the typical recipient henceforth will get only about as much as he or she put in and todays young may well get less than they put in
874229 the beauty of social insurance is that it is actuarially unsound everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit privileges that far exceed anything he has paid in exceed his payments by more than ten times
874230 how is it possible it stems from the fact that the national product is growing at a compound interest rate and can be expected to do so for as far ahead as the eye cannot see
874231 social security is squarely based on what has been called the eight wonder of the world compound interest a growing nation is the greatest ponzi game ever contrived
874232 dont save them dont wait spend those taxes right now
874233 the left is just going to squander all the tax money stop that by cutting the tax
874234 it is a mathematical certainty that the longer the present day payroll tax remains in effect the higher the future payroll tax must be if the system is to remain financed by payroll taxes
874235 this will eventually necessitate raising employees contributions rate later to a point where future beneficiaries will be obliged to pay more for their benefits than they would if they obtained this same insurance from a private insurance company
874236 i say it is inequitable to compel them to pay under this system more than they would have to pay to a private insurance company and i think congress would be confronted with that embarrassing situation
874237 if we should let a situation develop whereby it eventually becomes necessary to charge future beneficiaries rates in excess of the actuarial cost of the protection afforded them we would be guilty of gross inequity and gross financial mismanagement bound to imperil our social insurance system
874238 rate in excess of the actuarial cost of the protection afforded them
874239 im defending fdrs social security from those who want to destroy it
874240 i say it is inequitable we would be guilty of gross inequity and gross financial mismanagement bound to imperil our social insurance system
874241 i know hes looking at several opportunities to see whats out there but this is a team where ive been there six years and ive been to the eastern conference finals or better every year of my career a lot of people dont get the opportunity to say that a lot of people dont get the opportunity to experience winning an nba championship getting to the finals those type of things dont come without hard work i thought my whole team did a good job of that throughout my career there like i said michael curry hes a very experienced guy even though this is his first year of coaching hes a very experienced guy hes been with us hes played with us our core group of guys and i think it would help out tremendously by having him as our coach knowing what to expect from him he knows what to expect from us
874242 i am continuing to do everything i can to improve this team
874243 oh if we get t mac well win the championship thats what we need
874244 you just repeat yourself post after post what im saying is that our team needs a change because they are doing the same thing every year we lose to teams that arent as good
874245 i wanted an easy way to refer to specific lines in the document during conversations
874246 the open xml converter allows you to convert open xml files that were created in office 2008 for mac or office 2007 for windows so that you can open edit and save them in earlier versions of office for mac open xml converter can convert word documents excel workbooks and powerpoint presentations that are in the open xml format so that you can open and edit the files in office 2004 for mac and office v x for mac you can choose to convert and open one file or convert a large number of files
874247 and then this little man came walking by when i opened the door
874248 its just a party thats all you know what i mean who has time for all that
874249 suspend temporarily or reduce some laboratory services during the forthcoming summer months
874250 the lack of appropriate staffing levels and in particular the curtailment of summer locum cover
874251 its clear that government imposed hse cutbacks continue to affect patient care and will be accelerated over the summer months
874252 most blood testing has been suspended until september the department is unable to carry out testing for routine auto immune screens such as ana and lupus etc the provision of microscopy diagnostic services on all urines will not be performed with a few exceptions that delays and curtailments are to be expected in the histology department and that tests such as thyroid functioning should not be carried out in july or august but postponed until later
874253 i was given a copy of the circular by a health care professional
874254 these tests are being suspended as a result of staff shortages and the failure to have a summer locum worker appointed i met a woman who is in need of regular blood tests she now has to wait until september for her next test
874255 she was distressed that she will have to wait at least six weeks the decision to curtail and stop blood testing is another cost cutting measure
874256 only a small proportion of tests and services are temporarily curtailed as a cost containment measure and all urgent essential and priority work is carried out
874257 it is quite wrong to claim as sinn fein did that most blood testing has been suspended at the mid western lab this summer it is requested that only urgent and clearly essential specimens be submitted during this period due to the reduction in laboratory locum cover it is also stated that should users of the pathology laboratory services wish to discuss any issues or concerns arising from the letter they are free to do so via the relevant appropriate consultant pathologists we are not refusing to process test requests but have merely highlighted the need to curtail certain services over a limited period of time
874258 is akin to a soviet era gulag where the families were deposited in a cluster of dwellings
874259 this idea for limerick would result in such areas fast becoming no go areas
874260 it will send out a message to these problem families that we are getting very serious about their activities with these units we can take these families out of council tenancy and they wont be going into private estates
874261 for the last 10 years we accepted these people who were taking freedom away from others but we are still offering them accommodation in a secure housing environment where there will be maximum support from all statutory bodies who have the task of rehabilitating these families back into the wider community they will be able to re enter society as soon as they have completed the rehabilitation process and are passed by the regeneration agency for reintegration
874262 we will now be able to show the courts that we are willing to address this unacceptable anti social element
874263 its s a bit late in the day for the city councillors to be submitting plans to the regeneration boards on how to solve the problem of anti social behaviour this latest approach is a backward step and will only serve to create more problems in the long run
874264 my thoughts are with the mcdonnell family as they come to terms with their great loss following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country at gerard becoming the first irish person to scale k2 it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
874265 and speaking of major trade possibilities theres a blockbuster brewing in the nba too the detroit pistons we hear are making a big pitch to the houston rockets for perennial all star tracy mcgrady
874266 a report out of detroit indicated the pistons were close to getting a deal done that would land them houstons tracy mcgrady sources i spoke with this morning confirmed that the story is not true in fact the two teams havent had any type of talks with each other in quite some time last i checked telepathic deals arent allowed in the nba maybe this rumor was planted to get both sides talking again
874267 oh yeah were down 3 2 were basically skrewed maybe itll work out better next year
874268 okay we dont wanna play game 3 lets drop a egg
874269 oh look theyre losing theyre losing badly they must not be trying
874270 what is the formula to calculate tint in drawingml the documentation is wrong
874271 theres so much production involved in the costuming and the visual effects
874272 ive got enough money and im in a leadership role
874273 what i have to do is appeal to voters common sense and ask them if with the state in the condition its in is something wrong here
874274 he cant be doing a great job if the states in a mess
874275 i knew rep washington was going to have quite a bit of money and i knew angelo running against an incumbent was going to have trouble raising money
874276 this practice is really about organization building and safeguarding your fortress as the boss of the area
874277 this doesnt look like a good investment even to my best friends
874278 we wanted to have something that still puts dogs front and center
874279 the first time you do anything new like this youre always a little nervous
874280 but it looks like a great turnout so far we hope to make this an annual event
874281 in people years hes about 70 and like any 70 year old sometimes it all gets to be too much
874282 i just thought it would be fun to stop by
874283 we have a green guy not a narcoleptic purple guy we perform actual music not annoying kiddie tunes
874284 we never set out to perform for kid audiences but early on someone saw us and said theres a place for you in schools
874285 we enjoy ourselves and sometimes our friends come to visit
874286 arrest is an instantaneous shattering thrust expulsion somersault from one state into another
874287 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
874288 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
874289 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
874290 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country
874291 sometimes though you got thinking and your spirits soared your sentence was running out there wasnt much thread left on the spool lord just to think of it walking free on your own two legs
874292 standing there to be counted through the gate of an evening back in camp after a whole day of buffeting wind freezing cold and an empty belly the zek longs for his ladleful of scalding hot watery evening soup as for rain in time of drought he could knock it back in a single gulp for the moment that ladleful means more to him than freedom more than his whole past life more than whatever life is left to him
874293 shukhov felt pleased with life as he went to sleep
874294 the end of an unclouded day almost a happy one
874295 just one of the three thousand six hundred and fifty three days of his sentence from bell to bell
874296 its a little appreciation from the city to the community and back and forth
874297 its a nice way to open communication with residents among themselves and with various city departments
874298 national night out is celebrated once a year but it truly is a culmination of activities aimed at crime prevention throughout the year
874299 in aurora i think we have caught the spirit of the event which is to strengthen partnerships between the community and the police
874300 as neighborhoods change and residents move in and out national night out provides a means to get to know neighbors and police officers in a fun event
874301 the goal of the evening is to create a sense of commitment to reducing crime and a desire to improve the quality of life
874302 were looking for people to get outside and reconnect with their neighbors
874303 theyre here so fast i think thats a big thing
874304 its kind of hard to maintain a constant temperature with the meat we just use as much charcoal as we possibly can
874305 i look forward to it every year because the food is so good
874306 the longest continuous deployment of any united states ground combat military unit during operation iraqi freedom
874307 will you regret it when youre 30 if you dont go
874308 i dont want the state to take a role in telling us what to do
874309 my job in district 214 is try to do the best i can for this community
874310 the people here like what the schools provide and we cant endanger that
874311 if this is the land of opportunity then we as a state and as a society have an obligation to create those opportunities for everyone as best we can
874312 would a different kind of tax be as reliable i think its still pretty unclear
874313 but at the same time we never have enough i would like to see schools all over the state funded better but im not sure at this point how wed go about it
874314 i think there would be a way to make it work without hurting the kids out here in the suburbs but wed have to put aside politics to get there
874315 as a statewide system were only as strong as our weakest link
874316 if were failing to educate children somewhere whether its st charles or chicago or anywhere in the state and we have to remediate them down the line in the prison system or elsewhere thats not a good way of doing things
874317 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
874318 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
874319 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
874320 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
874321 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
874322 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
874323 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
874324 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
874325 it was pretty good i saw people having barbecue on the side of the street it was a good race
874326 people put up tents in the front yards they have a party they have a get together its been a huge success this thing is going to be here for a long time to come
874327 we made it on the podium for the first time im excited i told them i wont raise anybodys taxes i got on the podium
874328 the shoulder is really sore at the moment you just got to keep it as still as you can but its ok in general
874329 this is right up there with downers grove and downer avenue up in milwaukee all of the superweek events
874330 we sat out in their front yard and watched them go all the way up the road its pretty neat
874331 he seemed calm but looked like he was anxious to leave
874332 he walked out and thats the last time i saw my boy
874333 who knows he probably had the stuff stashed somewhere i guess
874334 but when girls were down there he would just stare at them from the bridge
874335 that device had a real potential to put that family in jeopardy
874336 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments
874337 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
874338 its no secret that we get a lot of complaints in there and we are using national night out to send a clear message
874339 the message is the neighborhood and police department have organized and we will fight back
874340 we have been a part of this event and are maintaining the tradition that was started in the past
874341 its also a great way to create relationships between the community and the police force
874342 im very happy about it its nice to earn some money for the team
874343 everybody loves the location and the neighborhood embraced the event
874344 i have to turn away its a little bit too scary
874345 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
874346 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
874347 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
874348 been adjudicated as a mental defective or been committed to any mental institution
874349 hiding it from your co workers that would have been very very difficult
874350 universities are pretty sloppy its an academic setting not a security setting
874351 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
874352 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
874353 have access to some of the most lethal substances imaginable
874354 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
874355 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
874356 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states
874357 i worry that someone coming in for four or eight years couldnt learn that job in that time
874358 its a job i love and i really wouldnt want to do anything else
874359 it will be years before we find another one like her
874360 i dont know why the clerk is included in the limits the city clerks more of a department head
874361 they like this truck because theres a bed in it
874362 you see a lot of trucks on the road but not everyone has the chance for the hands on theres a lot of joy here you dont even hear any kids crying there are no frowns all smiles
874363 theres a pipe that runs along the ladder that can pump 2 000 gallons of water every minute
874364 it gives people a chance to see the rigs and it gives us a chance to be out in the community
874365 we have board members that are very supportive of the environment
874366 were a private school we have to watch the budget
874367 all the exhaust in the building goes to an energy recovery unit
874368 the president has taken green classes since this first project
874369 theres a lot that was put into the building that you cant see
874370 its so much fun this is my second year competing
874371 its a lot of fun and we have a good time with this
874372 next year ben and luke are thinking of making a boat
874373 i just didnt leave the house when i was in a fib
874374 its a concern because it can be difficult to pass a needle through
874375 in ganschows case we turned the radio frequency on and the baylis device went right into the left atrium one try very easy
874376 speaking to us at medical conferences many doctors have expressed to us their intention to switch over completely to the nrg needle
874377 i just thought 80 had a better ring to it
874378 in a few years hopefully well look back and think how silly it was the way we were poking needles through like that
874379 im just looking forward to having a normal life where i dont have to pretend to tie my shoes in a store because im getting dizzy and need to put my head down
874380 its loud its dirty not something you get to see every day
874381 the guys who look like they can go the farthest never do
874382 im a huge cubs fan and think it would be cool to sing in front of all those people
874383 im nervous for her but im not worried shell be nervous if she wins she loves to sing in front of huge crowds
874384 and i really want to sing this year because the cubs are going to the world series
874385 my brother is the biggest cubs fan in the world
874386 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
874387 on the honesty and the loyalty of the current security force in kirkuk
874388 marginalize any other ethnic group control kirkuk and annex it to kurdistan
874389 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
874390 i have always declared that these three constitute three distinct personages and three gods
874391 father i pray for them which thou has given me out of the world and not for those alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be agreed as thou father are with me and i with thee that they also may be agreed with us
874392 most experts are in agreement that its inevitable that we will become totally infested over time
874393 when that will happen i cant say its pretty grim
874394 it got here by accident and its taking advantage of the food source here
874395 this isnt the first time this kind of thing happened
874396 these things happen and its not coincidental that theyre all invasive pests that cause these things
874397 ash is a very popular tree because it has a lot of qualities that make it a good tree for landscaping
874398 there is no saving the tree once you start seeing symptoms its kind of too late
874399 we wanted to get the national night out celebration back into the neighborhoods because we thought it was important for people to get out and get to know each other and the people on their blocks
874400 its important for us to know that individual neighbors can rely on each other
874401 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
874402 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
874403 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
874404 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
874405 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
874406 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
874407 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
874408 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
874409 because we now have conflicting evidence the court should reconsider its earlier decision
874410 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
874411 we wanted to get the national night out celebration back into the neighborhoods because we thought it was important for people to get out and get to know each other and the people on their blocks
874412 its important for us to know that individual neighbors can rely on each other
874413 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
874414 today is a proud day for all of us who fought so hard to ensure floridians votes are fully counted
874415 his commitment to uniting the party and ending the uncertainty surrounding the process
874416 senator obamas action today will help unify the democratic party it also underscores the need for a fairer and more sensible process for selecting presidential nominees as well as the critical role of michigan and florida two representative swing states over the efforts of iowa and new hampshire to perpetuate their privileged position in that process
874417 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
874418 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
874419 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
874420 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
874421 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
874422 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
874423 i am very aware and grateful for what rcl has done for my daughter and know what they do for the other clients i want to give back by helping out so that other disabled people can have the same type of help that my daughter has received
874424 most of their clients are people that would fall through the cracks if it werent for rcl because they dont fit the criteria for permanent residential living
874425 to offer adults with developmental and or physical disabilities opportunities to achieve greater self esteem dignity and participation in all aspects of community life through affordable housing options individualized skill instruction and necessary support services
874426 a person who eats sleeps and drinks rcl she is totally dedicated to the needs of our clients many of whom do not have families and to our volunteers many of whom are also clients we are a young organization we need more volunteers and we also need people who are willing to act as mentors for our clients
874427 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody
874428 we take our legacy of providing trustworthy and balanced resources to citizens and lawmakers seriously
874429 the league of women voters truly has left its footprint on american history and i believe our democracy is stronger because of it
874430 its one way for a lot of people to see the candidates face to face at the same time and on a level playing field
874431 and we think we ask better questions than the press more issue orientated questions and less gotcha questions

874440 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks

874442 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
874443 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
874444 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
874445 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars
874446 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider

874508 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history

874547 boy i brought you into this world and i will take you out
874548 todays supreme court ruling is an assault on law enforcements efforts to punish these heinous felons for the most despicable crime
874549 that there is a judge anywhere in america who does not believe that the rape of a child represents the most heinous of crimes which is deserving of the most serious of punishments is profoundly disturbing
874550 i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes
874551 i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that does not violate our constitution

874557 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
874558 for the strong racist streak that articulated his politics and almost all of his political campaigns
874559 for me and millions of other democrats i believe that the most important step that you can take now is to encourage the congressional black caucus to urge senator obama to select senator hillary clinton as his vice presidential running mate
874560 hes a politician and hes going to do and say what politicians do and say
874561 your sons a writer but you can barely write your name

874584 they are both representative of the general direction and growth of our membership
874585 our base used to be oems and operators but weve kind of grown outwards to include integrators and middleware vendors as well as software and solution providers who are higher up the stack and who want to provide functionality to the spec these are companies that are going to contribute to the code
874586 we see it as an endorsement of the strategy we developed limo has had an advanced and intricate governance model and now analysts have said the governance model theyre working on for symbian will be very similar so we see it is a validating point for the idea of collaboration and openness it allows us to shift the conversation around openness from debating its merits to talking about tactics
874587 these are huge names nokia and google industry giants with wonderful products and they are now working on a model of collaboration
874588 still we think limo is uniquely positioned with our governance licensing and our appeal to leaders in the mobile industry
874589 part of the appeal of limo is that were not out there with grand ambitions to do consumer marketing and branding
874590 that is appealing to the operators youre not going to have kids clamoring for the latest limo phone but they will be looking for that cool motorola or samsung device
874591 youre right just keep calling em like you see em
874592 like lambs to the slaughter the braves take the field

874595 agents are empowered to share the contents of seized computers with other agencies and private entities for data decryption and other reasons the newspaper said

874597 horray you just wasted your breath see me not asking means i never gave a shit in the first place may your words enjoy the most direct path through my ears just please stop speaking the piercing overbearing jabber is beginning to trigger a migraine
874598 so tyler turned down your invitation to offer his sick citizens free medical care did he
874599 there are times i wish i hadnt stopped you from presenting your credentials as baroness medusa personal representative if i had at least all of this diplomatic crap would be landing on your plate instead of mine
874600 forget it i didnt spend all those years in foreign office service without learning a little bit about how the games played bernardus the minute you open your mouth as medusas officially accredited representative this stops being a case of a single rogue officer her majesty can disavow if she has to we cant afford to give tyler and his crew any basis to attack the notion that i acted independently of any orders from any higher authority especially since i did
874601 all of his ships such as they are and what there are of them are still sitting in orbit around monica
874602 from all appearances they plan to go right on sitting there too
874603 of course thats not a lot of comfort given how many ships definitely did depart from the system before i sent my little explanatory note to admiral bourmont
874604 we did let the pregnant workers from eroica return to the planet
874605 i cant imagine what these people were thinking about letting them work in an environment like that in the first place every extra atmospheric work contract in the star kingdom contains specific provisions to prevent exposing fetuses to the sorts of radiation hazards aboard a station like that
874606 but a lot of the star nations out here especially the poorer ones dont seem to think they have that luxury
874607 you mean they arent going to enforce proper liability laws against their local employers dont you after all insurance drives up overhead right and if they arent going to be liable legally at least anyway then why should any of them worry about a little thing like what happens to their workers or their workers children
874608 well letting them go back dirt side ought to earn us at least a little good press
874609 you know as well as i do how its going to be presented president tylers tireless efforts on on behalf of his citizens have finally borne at least partial fruit in convincing the heartless manticoran tyrant and murderer terekhov to allow these poor pregnant women the women the wicked manties have been callously exposing to all the threats of a space station environment along with the rest of their hostages as part of their barbarous threat to massacre helpless civilians to return to safety
874610 if theres any good press going around trust me tyler and his toadies will see to it that all of it focuses on him
874611 after reaching his hand into a sausage machine like this one he probably needs all the good press he can get
874612 assuming he ever stops playing the victimized total innocent and admits thats what he did which he doesnt seem to be in any hurry to do
874613 and just which sir are you asking to excuse you ms zilwicki
874614 cics just detected a hyper footprint sir a big one
874615 henrys coming we ought to put on the biggest parade this towns ever seen kids from the schools captain wiegand and his city militia the whole fulda barracks regiment
874616 it wont fly andrea weve got wes and clara back but the stift is missing its abbot and we dont even know where he is or if hes still alive hearts and minds stuff weve got to do something more subdued we cant ignore the way the monks have got to be feeling
874617 maybe henry could review the militia and the regiment out at barracktown
874618 that way we can pretty well secure the perimeter while henrys up on the reviewing stand not that im expecting the farmers to try anything the ram rebellion never really got violent over here the way it did at miltitz and anyway theyre on our side but we havent caught the kidnappers and we dont know if the guys who hauled schweinsberg away were the only ones that the archbishop of cologne sent into our territory
874619 did he send them because hes archbishop of cologne or did he send them because hes the brother of the duke of bavaria
874620 im not even sure he could separate those two things in his own mind
874621 if he wasnt maximilians brother he wouldnt be an archbishop
874622 is he in any position to do anything after the essen war
874623 or at least out of bonn and lurking somewhere over on the other side of the rhine but if weve still got some of the guys he hired running around loose and i dont know that we dont it doesnt seem likely but i cant be sure a closed perimeter looks good to me
874624 make sure theres a chair for him on the reviewing stand george chehab says henrys having problems with that hip again
874625 sure he can go through the new school building too while hes out at barracktown the roof is on now and theres glass in the windows we can set up the lunch in the larger schoolroom he can eat with the teachers weve hired a second teacher for next year
874626 how are you planning to get henry out to all the small towns and villages orville
874627 what is it about men whose wives have just had babies that makes them look insufferably smug and oh so pleased with themselves
874628 i mean its not as if the man did anything except get his rocks off months ago
874629 im just quoting my wifes none too admiring words addressed at me back when
874630 im simply glad that rebecca is well and the girl also
874631 we decided that a long time ago in fact it was supposed to have been the name we gave sephie except we decided in the end that sepharad would be better for our first child
874632 the woman who died in the car crash in california
874633 yeah sure well have to manage something discreet though becky maintains most of the rituals and customs but not all of them especially the ones she thinks are her words not mine stupid and pointless leftovers from tribal pastoralism but she tries not to rub anybodys nose in it
874634 reactionary scoundrels is the phrase becky herself uses to describe them
874635 she doesnt care at all what they think still most jews in the city are religiously very conservative if not always politically and she doesnt see any point in needlessly irritating them so although shes not maintaining the forty days of seclusion shes not flaunting the fact either come by our place tonight after dark
874636 what do you need to talk to her about if its something personal of course you can ignore the question
874637 and you should be part of the discussion anyway the problem is with beckys seat in the sotf congress shes been gone for a long time mike is she planning to come back to grantville if so well figure on running her again as the candidate of the fourth of july party but if shes not coming back or not coming back soon we really need to run somebody else we just cant keep that seat held for somebody in absentia
874638 we never came to any conclusions and yes i can see where itd be a problem for the party in thuringia
874639 whats the problem shes not hard to talk to at least if you can pry yourself through the small mob of cocers who are usually surrounding her
874640 and this time of day thats where youll usually find her at the coc headquarters downtown
874641 well this is a personal matter henry dreeson asked us to talk to her while we were here hes wondering and hes getting pretty damn dyspeptic about it when gretchens planning to come home and start taking care of that mob of kids of hers shes been gone just as long as becky you know
874642 we heard some noise outside and then the door literally burst in and the dea came in in full combat gear told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads
874643 and then we need to get a healer to you i was foolish and a little shocked i shouldnt have moved you it was just seeing all the blood i panicked a little anyway head injuries can be serious you need to get it checked here press your hand to it gently now i need to find water boiling and cooled and clean cloth to staunch this cut
874644 theres a first aid kit in the cupboard down the passage get it for me
874645 i will need to wash it and see if needs be i must carry you back to the last house we passed
874646 it should still be looked at by a healer shall i walk to the last house
874647 and get yourself arrested for wandering around without a woman stupid
874648 i am going to put a dressing on it but i want to clean the wound itself i have read the instructions on this bottle and it says i should add two drops to the water before cleaning it
874649 every child learns how to read in new eden it is beautiful script you have here as neat and uniform as the oldest holy writ
874650 we are all men and women made in gods image and equal in his sight hold still i need to work very carefully here
874651 you need to learn to be careful with your big mouth too
874652 youre an intolerant bigot talking about our culture like that it could get you into serious trouble
874653 i had not thought of it as being intolerant of your culture
874654 i had just seen it as right to proclaim against you forgive me
874655 yes im only used to my own culture lady now i am going to put a bandage around this dressing sister thirsdaughter would be very rude about it but it will serve i still do not see that what you people do is right in the eyes of man or god but i will try to keep my opinion to myself to keep my mouth shut
874656 youre going make me old before my time i suppose you can talk to me only when were alone i wont beat you even if i should now just let me lie here with my eyes closed for five minutes and then ill contact someone to do something about the scoot
874657 a bit sore but im all right how long was i asleep for
874658 hell id better do something about reporting that scoot its blocking the roadway the harvesters use the road a lot
874659 dont worry i went and fetched it i carried it back here
874660 get this into your dumb head you cant walk around here without a woman to escort you its not that i dont appreciate your doing it its just that you have to work within the rules here our rules or youll get both of us into trouble im liable for your actions you know
874661 look i know you didnt mean any harm but the next time you end up in front of a judge here it might not be one with more lust on her mind than justice or you might get old garanet again shell throw the book at you next time and it wouldnt just be at you it would be at me too youre my responsibility
874662 i wish i knew what went wrong with the scoot
874663 this is half of the rear axle as you can see it is badly worn along here it fractured with the extra weight as you went over the bump im sorry i should have run behind
874664 i need it for my job im afraid itll have to be fixed no matter what they decide to charge me
874665 i think i could fix it if i can find a suitable shaft
874666 i thought about going in that direction myself there is money in it but the trouble is according to my history teacher everything worked beautifully in diana for the first seventy five years by the time that things started breaking down wed lost a generations worth of minds that were used to dealing with technical repairs anyway they were used to being part of a technical society that had robots and factories we were cut off from those now were even losing an increasing number of maintenance robots and no one has the sort of skill required to fix those the matriarch set up a rota for training but were short on experience
874667 i will happily try and fix your vehicle it would work better if i could talk to brother kretz
874668 he is a very good engineer that woman would not tell me what shed done with him hes alone and scared
874669 oh hell he be treated all right howard were not barbarians look ill call a few people and ask
874670 i promised the council i would look after him so far i have done a poor job i will try to fix this scoot the bearings appear to still be sealed
874671 they failed in the corn grinder at home getting it work at all after that was difficult but i contrived
874672 if there is a part number on it i can order it from stores itll cost but if you think you could put it in itll be a lot cheaper than getting it fixed by someone else
874673 there is a number on it but explain how this works please woman there is a store of such parts prepared like the granaries joseph had made in egypt
874674 ive never heard of the joseph and egypt part and call me lani not woman
874675 look i should be able to access the onscreen manual just dont ever tell anyone i let you look at it im not supposed to let a man learn to read but you already know how to read youve read all sorts of things in this new eden place i suppose
874676 only the holy book the elder has some others and the healers have some too but i have never even heard of a book called onscreen manual
874677 book like a thing made of paper and printed on like court papers
874678 we heard some noise outside and then the door literally burst in and the dea came in in full combat gear told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads
874679 i got nothing pretty to say all my truths are off limits and tryin to speak my mind is like a horror story i dont wanna finish
874680 awak hanya boleh makan bubur nasi dan sup kosong tanpa isi paham ayam sayur semua tak boleh makan paham burger cheese semua tak boleh makan paham
874681 ask yourself a hundred years form now will anybody know the difference
874682 jeg er s lykkelig over at v re hjemme igen hos min lille familie
874683 det er jo ikke til at fatte at jeg sidder her i sikkerhed sammen med mine elskede n r de som jeg l i lejr med for f dage siden nu er d de det kunne lige s godt have v ret mig der aldrig var kommet ned
874684 for f dage siden sad vi sammen og snakkede og nu er han d d og det havde vi ogs v ret hvis vi var g et med dem
874685 dr m have en form for filter s nye udsendelser helt automatisk tjekkes for skjult reklame ikke mindst i forbrugerprogrammer som have og madmagasiner og s vil jeg dr fte med de vrige partier i medieforligskredsen om vi ikke skal sende et klarere politisk signal i fremtidige medieaftaler om at det her ikke accepteres
874686 jeg kan se problemet men vi g r meget for at der ikke s lges alkohol til mindre rige
874687 de andre lande har et meget mere struktureret samarbejde mellem politi ngoer og udl ndingemyndighederne
874688 med planen har vi et effektivt redskab til at bek mpe handel med mennesker vi har sociale og juridiske instrumenter til at hj lpe ofrene og bek mpe de kriminelle bagm nd og s har vi form et at skabe opm rksomhed om handlen
874689 s dan anskues det overhovedet ikke fra bruxelles for regeringen har jo ikke gjort noget endnu
874690 danmark er ikke spor aktive set i eu perspektiv vi giver ikke ofrene beskyttelse og vi g r ikke noget for at f det opklaret det er ikke noget som politiet giver nogen s rlig prioritet det foretager sig ingenting
874691 det er min opfattelse at danmark er et af de lande der har vist mindst bevidsthed og opm rksomhed omkring denne her problemstilling med menneskehandel og det g r situationen vanskeligere og mere farlig i danmark end i de vrige lande
874692 i am no longer defined by how many dishes i wash
874693 you insert your name here are not defined by anything that happened to you or anything you have done you are defined by who you are in christ you are gods beloved child
874694 ok lets talk to jesus what do you want to thank him for tonight
874695 dear jesus i hope i have a good nights sleep
874696 dear jesus thank you for the fireworks that we could see tonight from our front porch they were really nice thank you for letting us watch them
874697 father thank you so much for matt who once again has taught me much in this case that i lack gratitude for loads of little things youve done for me thank you for caring enough to point that out to me through a little child my child
874698 throwing an egg at a car is a low cost way to impose a relatively high cost penalty on the violator of a norm
874699 so it could well work as an enforcement strategy but it makes me uncomfortable youre violating the law in this case citizens are probably better off pressuring the government to enforce the norm
874700 the thrusting frontbencher who e mailed me last time bewailing the fact that he wouldnt have time to read them all should relax the whips dont keep a tally of books read
874701 the rose of tralee festival celebrates young irish women around the world and is a prestigious event
874702 the london entrant belinda brown has become the target of hateful comments on internet forums due the fact that she is of mixed heritage her mother is irish and her father is from jamaica
874703 the irish post decided to take a stance against this kind of racist behaviour and have reported it to the police who are now investigating
874704 i know that statements have been posted on a website but i have not even seen them and have no intention of looking for them
874705 since i was chosen as londons rose of tralee representative i have cherished the opportunity to represent the multiculturalism that is modern ireland
874706 online blogging has become a very dangerous tool in the belts of these racists it has become a big problem for those trying to fight this
874707 the campaign was launched in our latest edition and were going to be following the progress over the new few weeks
874708 im not sure 20 000 is going to get us much but if that doesnt happen then theres something wrong in epsom
874709 weve had a good reaction so far and had a few people phoning up saying well done
874710 its such a strange situation not to have christmas lights
874711 when i took over and someone said we dont have christmas lights i was shocked
874712 theres about 35 000 people living in epsom and its one of the most desirable places to live in the country
874713 there is a strong economic argument for investing in christmas lights as many retailers depend on christmas for a significant percentage of their annual profits
874714 it is extremely frustrating that the marking system has let us down
874715 it is a stressful time when finishing a course and looking for a job and not being able to tell possible future employers our grades may well mean the difference between getting an interview or not
874716 ive been applying for jobs since before i took the exams and it is frustrating not to know the results
874717 i have been asked at interviews and have had to say that they have not been marked yet but the editors do seem to understand i think they know that the nctj isnt perhaps the quickest at marking and releasing results to us
874718 there were more than 70 law scripts for uclan to mark we received these from the university at the end of june we got the papers for public administration around the same date
874719 we got the exams moderated and sent law back to uclan on july 10 public administration on july 28
874720 we turn things around as quickly as possible and we are dependent on our markers also turning things around quickly a lot of work is involved in processing the exam papers and we have a rigorous moderation process to ensure standardisation and effectiveness of marking
874721 there has been no delay throughout this process on the part of the nctj
874722 the nctj exams are not under our control but the students who sat the exams were told that the results would be collated by the journalism office and would be released to students if they emailed the office at the end of july
874723 het was een harde wedstrijd voor ons allebei en er waren heel wat lange rallies de voorbije twee weken speelde ik acht of negen matchen in soms zware omstandigheden maar ik heb hard aan mijn conditie gewerkt en dat loont nu
874724 yes we received the applications and the pieces were accpted everything is on track we look forward to seeing you at the show
874725 majalah pada dasarnya tidak berubah selama 150 tahun saya sangat frustasi dengan industri majalh yang tidak bergerak sama sekali
874726 kami berharap temuan kami pada akhirnya bermanfaat buat orang yang menderita luka yang tak kunjung sembuh seperti borok di kaki dan luka akibat diabetes serta bagi perawatan luka mengakibatkan trauma seperti luka bakar
874727 studi ini bukan hanya menjawab pertanyaan biologi mengenai mengapa hewan menjilati luka mereka
874728 dengan demikian kita tahu kedalaman beberapa danau lebih dari 10 meter karena mereka tampak sangat gelap di radar kalau dangkal kita akan dapat melihat dasarnya

874731 on thursday we were told by the fbi that she was alive they said she was injured but alive and in custody in afghanistan
874732 although the fbi has no information indicating this individual is connected to specific terrorist activities the fbi would like to locate and question this individual
874733 i like the green with lavendar and plum bling but its really too hard to choose

874738 ik ga me niet verontschuldigen voor iets waarvoor het ioc niet verantwoordelijk is
874739 daar stond ongeveer 25 centimeter water we hebben meteen de opdracht gegeven om die mensen op de benedenverdieping te evacueren
874740 ik ga me niet verontschuldigen voor iets waarvoor het ioc niet verantwoordelijk is
874741 ik ga me niet verontschuldigen voor iets waarvoor het ioc niet verantwoordelijk is
874742 ik ga me niet verontschuldigen voor iets waarvoor het ioc niet verantwoordelijk is

874744 obviously the economy is tough but the internet continues to hang in therebetter than some
874745 how do i remain true to myself how do i not lose myself
874746 the absence of common criteria certification is a showstopper for federal customers and other high security vertical markets such as finance
874747 one of the most significant benefits of common criteria evaluations is that the documentation requirements force vendors to implement strict change management and release controls which can minimize but not eliminate the serious and valid concern of vulnerabilities being introduced post evaluation given this rigor evaluated products should have fewer vulnerabilities over time than their non evaluated peers however do not assume that good cryptography is included in a common criteria evaluation fips 140 2 is a widely accepted and successful standard for evaluating cryptographic modules and ensures the correctness of cryptography
874748 our indoor and outdoor adaptive wireless lans have drawn considerable interest from prospective domestic and international users with high security requirements for whom fips 140 2 validation by itself is insufficient
874749 these users require a combination of common criteria certification fips 140 2 validation and directive 8100 2 compliance with these in hand we can bring the same mobility and efficiency benefits to high security users as we do to general enterprise customers it was not a simple task to meet these requirements and we are very pleased to be the first wireless lan vendor to have done so
874750 we are delighted to collaborate with apr labtec and expand our pipeline of supportive care products with two unique yet complementary delivery systems of ondansetron in our portfolio ondansetron oral spray from novadel and the oral thin film we are able to offer patients a better opportunity to find a product that meets their individual needs
874751 bioalliance is uniquely positioned to market and sell our ondansetron thin film product and we are very excited about the collaboration following approval ondansetron is expected to be the first prescription drugs to come to market utilizing thin film drug delivery technology

874756 son dont wear too much cologne you want a woman to feel your cologne not smell it
874757 this program addresses concerns raised by aliens community groups and immigration attorneys who say ice unnecessarily disrupts families while enforcing the law
874758 by participating in the scheduled departure program those who have had their day in court and have been ordered to leave the country have an opportunity to comply with the law and gain control of how their families are affected by their removal
874759 he was walking around carrying her head and telling the astonished villagers not to stop him
874760 they knew he had psychological problems but they didnt expect he would reach this point
874761 worshipping god as savior means that i acknowledge that i am a sinner in relationship with other sinners
874762 as inflation takes its toll digging into reserves looks inevitable for an increasing number these problems just wont simply go away by themselves
874763 the church is missionary by nature because god has sent it on a mission in the world under the leading of the spirit
874764 for in christ jesus neither reformed missional house church etc nor non reformed attractional big church etc counts for anything but only a new creation in whom faith expresses itself through love
874765 to put our relations as a communion under strain and some problems wont be resolved while those practices continue
874766 sensible in trying to keep the temperature as low as possible
874767 rumble on because it cant be resolved with two great cultural gaps
874768 i dont know how to describe it here was this object heading to another planet we were sending a robot to this little red dot in the sky to mars
874769 i want to be an astronaut and go to mars
874770 i wish i could do better than humbling and amazing but i cant
874771 i was a part of the best tradition of the human race exploring the unknown
874772 theyve been very clever about designing chemical instruments that make a lot of sense and should give us a reasonable level of accuracy
874773 and thats not an easy exercise when youre doing it 100 million miles away
874774 its a little robot it has eyes and an arm robots are a personification of people into machines it tastes and smells and its chemistry lab is essentially the tongue that allowed us to taste the martian soil
874775 i resigned a few months ago because i couldnt do both mars and the school committee
874776 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
874777 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
874778 individual or leader in the u s to speak for you on issues of race
874779 the black community is at least as traditional in its views as the larger american public
874780 hast thou not heard he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me
874781 whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
874782 i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
874783 we have always been confident that michigan would have a full delegation and a full vote at the democratic national convention
874784 senator obamas action today will help unify the democratic party it also underscores the need for a fairer and more sensible process for selecting presidential nominees as well as the critical role of michigan and florida two representative swing states over the efforts of iowa and new hampshire to perpetuate their privileged position in that process
874785 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
874786 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee when it meets on aug 24 to approve the delegates for the national convention pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
874787 i feel like ive been here three weeks not three days
874788 there was a lot of tension coming into the trade deadline

874790 the slider is one of my go to pitches and if i can have that slider i had out there today more consistently it would certainly make it a lot easier to pitch
874791 we like him but we feel that at sixteen you two are too young to date each other exclusively when youre young you should take time to meet and date a variety of people
874792 get off my back mom ive only gone out with him for a couple of months its not like im going to marry the guy or anything

874880 dan ingatlah takala rabbmu mengeluarkan keturunan adam dari sulbi mereka dan allah mengambil kesaksian terhadap jiwa mereka seraya berfirman bukankah aku ini rabbmu mereka menjawab betul engkau tuhan kami kami menjadi saksi kami lakukan yang demikian itu agar di hari kiamat kamu tidak mengatakan sesungguhnya kami bani adam adalah orang orang yang lengah terhadap ini keesaan allah

874882 aku ciptakan hamba hamba ku dalam keadaan lurus bersih maka setanlah yang memalingkan mereka
874883 kalau ada tuhan beserta nya masing masing tuhan itu akan membawa makhluk yang diciptakannya dan sebagaian dari tuhan tuhan itu akan mengalahkan sebagian yang lain
874884 allah sekali kali tak mempunyai anak al muminun 23 91
874885 apakah mereka diciptakan tanpa sesuatu pun ataukah mereka yang menciptakan diri mereka sendiri ataukah mereka telah menciptakan langit dan bumi itu sebenarnya mereka tidak yakin akan yang mereka katakan
874886 wahai manusia sembahlah tuhanmu yang menciptakanmu dan menciptakan orang orang sebelummu agar kamu menjadi orang yang bertakwa dialah allah yang menjadikan bagimu bumi sebagai hamparan dan langit sebagai atap dan menurunkan dari langit air hujan yang dengannya menumbuhkan tumbuh tumbuhan sebagai anugerah rizki bagimu maka janganlah engkau membuat bagi allah sekutu sekutu sedangkan engkau mengetahuinya
874887 tidaklah ku ciptakan jin dan manusia kecuali untuk beribadah kepadaku semata

874891 well mozzie for the first time in quite a while i really do not have that much to tell you it is over one and a half years ago that i last did a ko samui thinking i was about due for another one i decided to go back there on my way into the country and flew directly from london checking myself in for 10 days
874892 it is perhaps one of the best known and best value spas in the whole world and one of asias best kept secrets
874893 as well as offering an unrivalled cleansing programme the spa has some of the best vegetarian food in thailand and certainly has one of the best raw food preparation schools anywhere in the world
874894 they offer guests a wide range of holistic health practices including yoga chi gong meditation massage and reiki classes
874895 i try my best to look after myself and eat as well as i can which is easier said than done when you are constantly travelling my health is becoming far more important in my list of priorities as i get older especially as i really want to be physically active for many years to come
874896 basically you do not eat any food for seven days
874897 five times a day at three hourly intervals you go to the detox counter where a member of staff mixes a rather disgusting fasting drink containing psyllium which assists the process of soaking up toxins inside you and loosening up the stuff in your colon when you flush yourself out you get rid of it all becoming healthier as you complete every day of your programme
874898 they also give you daily supplements that provide your body with the nourishement it needs whilst you are not eating it is all set up for you when you are there so there is not much else you need to think about that leaves you with plenty of time to talk with the other guests do some yoga have a relaxing massage treatment sunbathe swim or just enjoy the environment
874899 i stayed in one of these a frame huts which have ensuite bathrooms so that you can flush in the privacy of your own room
874900 mozzie and his team do such a great job for me in compiling my blog i always make sure i send him the things he needs before the agreed deadline so he doesnt have to chase me
874901 one of the reasons i love coming back is the quality of the people that hang out here first of all there are many freelance practitioners that offer treatments at the spa and i have got to know some of them on a personal basis since i started coming to the island for example my friend anna runs classes every day for guests and her partner mark is an eft emotional freedom technique practitioner they always have a useful perspective on issues that concern health and well being and i learn a lot from talking to them and then there are the other guests who come from countries all over the world and from many different walks of life you are just as likely to meet an investment banker as you are an artist musician or author the one thing we all have in common is that we all want to understand our bodies better and be able to take care of ourselves as a result
874902 during this visit i met a wonderful american couple called greg an barb anthony who had come from their home in saudi arabia to do the cleansing programme i noticed that barb was taking a lot of pictures with an expensive looking camera spending quite a long time preparing each shot i discovered that she is a keen photographer and she kindly allowed me to send some of her pictures to the daily explorer for publication in this issue
874903 my lovely friends anna and mark right anna is in the centre and mark is to her right live in a small bungalow on the beach and invited a few of us round for some food drink and music left i met people from england russia denmark brazil and the united states and had a lovely evening
874904 unbelievably it turns out that we are both friends with someone in london who we both worked with at different times and the lady in question was actually featured in the last issue of the daily explorer ann marie was great company and has infectious charisma and energy i think we established a really nice friendship and hope we will remain in contact
874905 one of the things you see as a traveller when you return to the same place after a reasonably long time away is how rapidly economic development takes place especially when the economy is heavily dependent on tourism as it is in ko samui
874906 this is a new five star boutique hotel called the library which recently opened on the beach in chaweng
874907 i am so happy that i can start eating proper food again because the menu here is to die for
874908 i am taking it easy today starting with guys breakfast a mixture of organic goats yoghurt bee pollen and papaya which is absolutely delicious washed down with a glass of freshly squeezed apple juice
874909 its because i leave tomorrow and am going to see nikki again
874910 unfortunately for me there were no direct flights available when i wanted to travel so i had to book a ticket to bangkok and then transfer on to another flight with air asia to chiang mai
874911 even though the recent massive increases in oil prices mean the tickets are much more expensive than they were a year ago there is still intensive competition in asia for passengers and you can pick up some bargain fares here if you know where to look
874912 and was built to replace the ageing don mueang airport in order to cope with the ever increasing number of passengers transiting through bangkok as the asian economies continue to grow
874913 arriving at a foreign airport and being met by a friendly face especially someone close to you has got to be one of the best most joyful experiences one can have in life
874914 although we spent a month together back in march when we went to ko lipe southern thailand it felt like it was ages ago and it was wonderful to see her again
874915 nikki has an english friend in chiang mai who is a yoga teacher he has his own studio complete with a separate small house on a secluded leafy and very quiet property inside the old city he needed to go back to the uk for a couple of months and invited nikki to look after the house while he was away the timing was absolutely perfect
874916 having spent the last few months living in guest houses nikki was thrilled to have her own space especially her own kitchen
874917 whilst for me i have spent nearly 1 000 days moving from one accommodation to another living out of the same holdall the opportunity to unpack everything and put my few items of clothing into proper draws for a few weeks was like heaven and an opportunity to experience having a home for a little while
874918 i have become grateful for the most simple pleasures since i started travelling
874919 she prepares some wonderful meals for the two of us there is an abundance of cheap fresh local fruit and vegetables here that makes your mouth water every time you go shopping
874920 she teaches young children between 5 10 years old english and drama twice a week and is always really excited about the lessons she prepares for them
874921 she also has a creative partnership with an american lady called erin palmer and the two of them sometimes run professional training events for local organisations and businesses one of the things i love about nikki is that she really does her very best to integrate into the thai community she recently attended a three week basic thai language course at the chiang mai university so that she could enjoy more dialogue with thai people in their own language
874922 this is typical of the kind of spelling mistakes you often find in signs and menus which really make me smile
874923 although you can hire a car while you are here you really do not need to
874924 the roads can get quite congested and there is nowhere to park its just like london
874925 there is no public bus service as such and metered taxis have only been introduced recently so there are not very many around which is just as well as they are expensive and a lot of drivers do not like using the meter so most local people use something called a songthaew which is like a cross between a bus and a taxi
874926 the songthaews operate all hours on many different routes but always between two fixed points they will stop anyhwere if someone wants to get on provided there is room which there usually is and once you are on board you can ask the driver to stop at any place along the route when you want to get off most rides cost a standard 30 pence and are very good value
874927 another option is the noisy but very quaint tuk tuks which are gas powered tricycles that zip around the city
874928 the tuk tuks are mainly used by tourists mile for mile they are more expensive than songthaews as you do not share the ride with anyone else most local people get around on 100cc or 125cc motor cycles and at any one time you will see thousands of them buzzing around the place
874929 although they operate on fixed routes most of the day and evening sometimes a driver will take you to a destination which is not on his route provided that you can agree the right fare between you
874930 some people come here to retire others to hang out for a while whilst some come to work here taking jobs as teachers or working with numerous ngos that have a base or field operations in the region
874931 an ngo is a non government organisation typically set up to serve the local communities in developing nations by people from more prosperous nations
874932 the reason i know about them is that two of their team attend the same thursday evening meditation group as me and nikki when they told us about their work here we were fascinated to find out more and arranged to meet them for lunch with some of their colleagues who were visiting from overseas
874933 over lunch we discovered that their vision is to support communities in developing countries at a local level to make sure aids competence spreads more quickly than the virus they have built a team of experienced facilitators who mainly work on a voluntary basis to spend time with community leaders and help them acknowledge the reality of hiv and aids support them to build their capacity to respond and reduce their vulnerability to risk ultimately they want to see every human being coming into contact with aids have the opportunity to live out their full potential
874934 it is one of our favourite places to eat as the food is so good and the atmosphere is the most serene imaginable
874935 i was very inspired by this group of people who are passionate about and dedicated to what they are doing i am sure that some of my former colleagues would make excellent facilitators and i would like to invite them to check out the
874936 in our experience it punches well above its weight in this area when compared to citys of a similar size in other asian countries and it is one of the reasons it is so popular with expats
874937 i had no idea there was any sort of jewish community in chiang mai and was surprised further still when i arrived to find well over 100 people gathered for the short religious ceremony and traditional friday evening meal
874938 the evening was a real gas with lively conversation over four courses of great food which was generously provided by our hosts at the centre during the meal there were frequent interruptions for blessings stories and singing and although i didnt understand any of the words i enjoyed soaking up the wonderfully energetic atmosphere it is well worth attending if you ever get to visit chiang mai
874939 i discovered that he is a graduate from the goodman school of drama and he also founded the stage actors ensemble of chicago
874940 nikki is very impressed by him i think she intends to appear in one of his forthcoming productions and i have to admit i would be quite interested myself
874941 chiang mai is not known much for english theatre but enjoyed the presence of local and international audiences for the recent production of the gin game which was directed by stephan
874942 it was superb and stephan starred in the play too
874943 thats something i hope will never be the case for me when i am old
874944 she is a fully qualified cranio sacral therapist and works with people who feel that their health and well being is compromised in some way
874945 people might ask for a session with tameer for all sorts of reasons and typically they would be physical ailments such as skeletal or joint conditions headaches sciatica organ weakness or prostrate problems none of these are relevant to me and i believe i am in very good shape healthwise but i have been experiencing a bit of what i call spiritual turbulence in recent months as i try to figure out how to construct my life going forward i thought a session with her would be very valuable and it turned out to be a really good decision
874946 not only have i felt a sense of inner calmness since our session together she also managed to re align parts of my spine that were very slightly twisted out of place which i was not even aware of
874947 with her hands gently cradling your head she listens to the flow of your life force housed in the craniosacral fluids that surround your brain spine and nervous system
874948 in response your body begins its self healing process it brings to awareness its chosen unresolved issue s allowing an inner wisdom to guide the experience from a state of stillness tameer acknowledges the issue viewing it from a base of extensive technical intuitive and hands on knowledge this time together is only the beginning of the healing process the work begun by your body continues on its own over hours days or even weeks until the issue is resolved or your body can go no further on its own
874949 sometimes it is hard to find places that have really healthy vegetarian options and they also tend to prepare their meals so they are very spicy which does not really suit my palate
874950 so occasionally nikki and i will eat at home but more often than not we go out for pretty much everything local dishes like chicken noodle soup or som tam traditional spicy salad can be purchased for around 40 50 pence ironically fresh coffee costs twice as much but it is still lovely to have at least one cup a day
874951 as a thank you to nikki for hosting my visit i offered to take her out a couple of nights to some of the local eateries that are slightly more up market especially ones that we had not yet tried out in all the months we have been in chiang mai since she is a bit of a foodie this was an extremely well received invitation and i think it scored me some very valuable brownie points
874952 for around 50 pence you get a very tasty and filling bowl of egg noodles with spicy chicken in a kind of soup
874953 youve got to have a good old cuppa every now and again
874954 the list of great places to eat here gets added to constantly so there are always plenty of new venues to try out
874955 i discovered that wat suan dok have a programme which they call and went along one wednesday evening
874956 i sat with three or four monks from cambodia burma and bangladesh and asked them about their lives it was fascinating to me when they told me that some of them became novices at the age of 12 are now in their late twenties and have lived the whole of that time within the monastery according to their buddhist beliefs and values i found contemplating that reality pretty difficult so when they invited me to come back the following week and go to their meditation centre in the hills with them for 24 hours i jumped at the opportunity and willingly accepted
874957 the grounds of the centre are beautifully kept and the atmosphere is so calm you feel like you can really slow down and enjoy the present moment so much more easily something i am encouraging myself to do more often these days
874958 during the period i was there the monks showed us many different ways of meditating including sitting walking and laying meditations
874959 for anyone who is just finding out about it this is a great introduction
874960 i chose this photo because it is a visual image that is very unusual at the time i was sitting in a small covered market in sa pa northern vietnam having a bowl of beef noodle soup for lunch and when i looked all around me there were people from many different hmong ethnic tribes although they all look similar to us they distinguish themselves by their colourful headgear being there reminded me of a scene from one of the star wars movies when they go into an inter galactic bar and see loads of strange and wonderful creatures from different parts of the galaxy all hanging out together
874961 when i arrived in laos i was very stunned by how basic everything was and it felt like a million miles away from what i was used to in england some of the hill tribe villages i visited with our guide rarely if ever see white people like me they are very poor and only have access to electricty for one or two hours per day so everything is done by hand including the grinding of wheat to make bread but still the children are so bright and playful and have such high spirits this group were really fascinated by my video camera and laughed uncontrollably when i played them back their own video images
874962 i could not believe my own eyes when i saw the millions of people riding motorcycles in ho chi minh city formerly saigon it was overwhelming the country is prospering but cars remain something that only very few people can afford although i am sure it is changing
874963 i encountered more wonderful children in cambodia these two boys kept me company at one of the many temples in the sprawling angkorian complex at siem reap formerly angkor wat only discovered relatively recently the complex is vast and nikki and i spent a week exploring all of it luckily for the cambodians it is in their country as it one of the principal reasons why visitors come to their country to spend their much needed currency cambodia has been devastated for many years since the ludicrously destructive khmer rouge regime under pol pot wreaked havoc in the mid 70s and indiscriminate bombing by america during the vietnam war prior to that
874964 when i visited the site known as the killing fields outside phnom penh i stood speechless for some time as i tried to contemplate what went on there not too many years ago thousands of perfectly decent loving innocent cambodian men women and children were routinely tortured and murdered because they refused to acknowledge a set of rules and values that were violently imposed by the khmer rouge yet another example of people who refused to give up their inner freedom in the face of the worst kind of intimidation imaginable
874965 thousands of bones have been recovered over the years yet despite this we were still able to find tiny shards of bone and fragments of rotting clothing in different parts of the site a grim reminder of the horrific events that took place which until i went there i knew very little about
874966 when we were on the tiny island of ko tao in thailand i slipped whilst trying to climb some rocks and cut my arm at the time i was not really aware that it was important to sterilise the wound and thought that a dip in the sea would be sufficient how wrong could i be within days i had developed a severe fever and my arm had swollen to nearly twice its normal size i knew something was badly wrong and that i had some kind of infection so went to the clinic on the island where i was immediately put on a drip and not allowed to leave for four days however i still have my arm and it works perfectly so i am not complaining
874967 another scary moment happened inside a temple compound in vientiane laos i lost track of where nikki had got to for a few minutes and started to get a bit worried i searched furiously for her but all i could see were some rather shifty looking chaps standing by a freshly dug mound of earth causing my mind to come up with all sorts of stories about what might have happened to her fortunately nikki showed up a few minutes later
874968 when we arrived in thailand in november 2005 we travelled non stop for three or four months until we reached
874969 these photos made it in to my collection as they were both opportunities for me to try a completely new and extremely different look with my hairstyle the first came in january 2006 when nikki and i were invited to a carnival party on ko samui which meant i needed a style in keeping with the theme hence i managed to procure this rather amazing wig left for the evening and i absolutely loved wearing it as i got to experience what it must be like to have long hair then in april 2006 we were invited to an april fools party in our apartment block and had to do something foolish so i decided to completely shave my head for the first time ever right which felt really weird i must admit though i definitely prefer it now
874970 thailand like many other countries in asia is predominantly buddhist which is not a religion in the conventional sense but more of a philosophy of how to live without suffering and when they use the word suffering they mean the anguish that people feel when they become attached to particular things which they lose or when their expectations about particular outcomes are not met so whilst travelling in asia i was always consciously examining my own attitudes to attachment and suffering to see where and how i could be more compassionate with the parts of myself i was generally criticising myself about meditation was the main vehicle for this as well as talking to wise people i met along the way and reading spiritual books after the completion of my tefl course in june 2006 see above i briefly returned to the uk to complete the process of letting go of my last few owned possessions which included my much cherished triumph thunderbird motorcycle left and my mercedes right which i felt i no longer really needed although i was able to let them both go i have to admit that in my most private moments i really miss that motorbike
874971 having now tasted life as a budget traveller i have to say that i like the honest simplicity of living modestly and think overall that i even prefer it to the excesses of affluent western society that i was so much a part of for so many years way back then i think i lost my sense of appreciation for the finer things and started to expect them almost by right now its very different you can imagine how happy i was when i returned to bangkok from england flush from having sold my car and motorbike it was around the time of nikkis birthday so i secretly arranged for us to leave our 8 a night guest house off the khao san road and check in to the luxurious four seasons hotel for a couple of nights she was thrilled i remember how comfortable the bed was with the heaps of sumptous pillows they give you and i realised that a comfortable bed was something that i had really missed
874972 mozzie byte at the daily lama recruited our very own book reviewer
874973 this picture is one of my favourites of me and nikki and was taken in november 2006 in ko samui we had just returned from four months of travel in cambodia and vietnam and were about to go and do a seven day detox and cleanse at the spa in lamai we had been travelling together for about a year at this point and despite the usual niggles that all couples have we had established a really great relationship she is a really awesome human being very loving and compassionate and she has an amazing childlike quality which means she enjoys absolutely anything and everything we have definitely had a lot of fun on our travels together
874974 within a year of launching the daily lama mozzie and the team had attracted over 10 000 site visitors and blogster who were our web hosts at the time voted the daily lama as their blog of the week the big media players started to take notice of the amazing journalistic talent that mozzie and amber had brought on board and we were being offered syndicated deals and partnerships left right and centre one of our photographs was chosen for the front cover of time magazine best photos of 2006 feature left and hello magazine ran an exclusive feature on our detox at the spa in november that year
874975 in luang prabang in laos i needed lightning fast reactions when unbelievably a wild tiger wandered into a remote woodland restaurant where nikki and i had gone for lunch left i tried not to panic and was determined to stay focused then i carefully made my move and managed to escort the wild animal off the premises before anyone could get hurt it was a very scary encounter we had a similar situation in the australian outback when just before dawn we were chased away from our camper van by a bunch of giant kangaroos right on that occasion we managed to find a hiding place behind a large tree and quietly waited until they had gone
874976 when nikki and i arrived in perth on the west coast of australia in december 2006 we started to consider the idea of crossing the nullabor a vast 3 000 kilometre stretch of dry scrubland which can be traversed by car provided that you carefully plan your route and take all the safety precautions necessary like knowing how to avoid collisions on the road with kangaroos and other wild animals in distance terms it is the equivalent of driving from london to moscow after doing our research we decided to rent a properly equipped camper van for a week and set off for a real adventure going from perth to adelaide along the 2 700 kilometre perth in december 2006 to spend christmas with nikkis family we were absolutely chuffed to discover that her cousin james had managed to get us tickets to see the australian cricket team play england at the waca stadium as part of the ashes test match series these tickets are like gold dust and we had come across travellers in asia who were on their way to australia to see some of the matches being played
874977 in march 2007 we spent three glorious hours climbing the iconic steel arch of the sydney harbour bridge thats us two on the left of the official photograph no one is permitted to take their own cameras or carry any loose items to ensure that nothing falls on to the moving traffic below
874978 mozzie asked me to choose my favourite landscape shot of the entire trip so far which was almost an impossible task after much deliberation i chose this picture of wineglass bay in tasmania which was featured in our island at the bottom of the world issue in february 2007 i love everything in this picture the vibrant colours the view of the mountains cascading into the distance the shape of the coastline and the way in which nikki is just peacefully sitting on top of a rock taking all of the incredible beauty in we hiked for a couple of hours to reach the vantage point where we took this picture from and it was worth every single second
874979 look carefully at this picture and you will see me hurtling towards the ground
874980 unlike the sky tower jump which was an act of spontaneous madness doing a bungy jump was something i had made a promise to myself many years ago that i would do and not just any old bungy jump a j hackett from queenstown new zealand invented the concept years ago so i thought that if i ever got to do a jump myself that is where i would do it the bungy business has matured since the early days and there are now jumps all over the world operators compete by making them longer and more daring i chose to do the franz josef glacier on the southern island of new zealand was another first for me as i had never even seen a glacier before let alone climb one it is one of 140 that flow from the southern alps few sights equal the spectacle of these giant tongues of ice grinding down through the landscape to just 250 metres above sea level the only place outside argentina where this occurs there were signs alerting travellers to the obvious dangers of climbing the glacier which is continuously moving causing collapses which can lead to very serious injuries or deaths the ice has a blue tint due to the rayleigh effect where tiny particles and minute air bubbles suspended in the ice scatter light in different directions this scattering affects light of shorter wavelengths more than that of longer wavelengths which is why short wavelength blue violet light is refracted back first
874981 like the bungy jump i had also promised myself that i would make a tandem freefall parachute jump at some stage and new zealand granted me that wish too climbing in the aeroplane to 16 000 feet i could feel my mouth getting dry and my palms sweating and then suddenly we were hurtling through the air faces ripping off as we moved through the sky like a missile at over 100 miles per hour it was so exhilirating from that height you get a full one minute and 20 seconds of freefall before the chute is deployed which is a very long time up there
874982 with less than two minutes to go to my big skydive i start wondering if all of this was such a good idea in new zealand i felt like i was living out my own version of the bucket list and have fulfilled many of the promises i made to myself
874983 two places stick out in my mind from my visit to new zealand the first was in a tiny little town called harewa where i came across the most bizarre thing i would have expected to find kevin wasley a local man has been an elvis presley fan all his life and has assembled the largest private collection of elvis memorabilia in the country and possibly the world his garage and half of his small home left are now a museum dedicated to the king and he receives contacts and visits from people all over the world the second place the lazy shag backpacker hostel in kaikoura right makes it into my list but not for the reason you might think this place epitomised the joy of the travelling life for me i was waiting here to take the boat out to sea and catch a sighting of my first sperm whale the weather was very intermittent so we were sort of on standby waiting for a call i hung around for two days and in that time i had so many laughs and great conversations with other travellers i did not want to leave
874984 this is me proudly displaying my road map of new zealand which traces my route around the country in 12 weeks i covered about 11 000 kilometres and checked out just about every inch of the place i managed to visit virtually every corner and completed some of the most amazing hikes i have ever done before i left australia to go there i have to admit i was very nervous about travelling alone up until then i had only travelled with nikki so there was always someone to talk to and share the planning with having this experience was like a rite of passage for me and i faced my fears about being on my own and taking care of myself discovering that i am much more comfortable and capable than i thought i would be
874985 the dalai lama is someone who i greatly admire he is a powerful man who inspires people through love compassion and humility rather than force manipulation or violence in 1989 he was awarded the nobel peace prize for his non violent struggle for the liberation of tibet he has consistently advocated policies of non violence even in the face of extreme aggression he also became the first nobel laureate to be recognized for his concern for global environmental problems i had heard much about him from many different people and hoped that i might get the chance at some stage to see him talk in public my wish was granted in sydney in june 2007 when i turned out with thousands of others on a wet and windswept day to listen to him talk for over an hour his message was clear and simple world peace starts with inner peace within yourself
874986 my favourite picture of me is this one taken by my old friend grant atwell who i met in california in 2007 after 24 years he is an amazing photographer and during a visit to london in march this year he asked me to pose for this shot in covent garden demonstrating how a professional eye for compositon can make all the difference whatever is next for me i will make sure that mozzie and his team keep you posted in the daily explorer
874987 youll be able to pick it up at your local comcast office when your tivo arrives
874988 it will probably take about an hour or two for them to respond
874989 as a short aside anyone who thinks that apple is going to get into the dvr game is insane if they were uncomfortable with the cell phone industry what do you think theyll think of the mess that is cable television
874990 nestle will face swift legal challenge if it does not fully evaluate the environmental impact of diverting millions of gallons of spring water from the mccloud river into billions of plastic water bottles
874991 they should be places you go to get better not get cancer
874992 whatever we can do to make this country a smoke free zone we should do it
874993 are on a different level they play at 10 000 miles per hour and they do it with such precision
874994 aiding persons to sell and be in possession of tobacco manufactured in canada that was not packed and was not stamped
874995 the message sent today is that no company is above the law
874996 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
874997 the transaction between the assessee and his grandfather can be viewed as financial help coming from elders in the family
874998 the high risk long term reward ratio of drug discovery process is an unattractive proposition for investors like us the success rate is very low in pure drug discovery process which involves screening of thousands of potential targets and zeroing in on only one or two targets that reach the trial stage
874999 investment is dependent on the firms strategy and fund availability
875000 india is yet to prove its skills in developing and commercialising an own molecule it is a high risk game and so far none of our compounds have reached the last lap of phase iii clinical stage in accordance to global clinical trial norms this may be the reason for lack of equity investments in our drug discovery programmes
875001 one should be careful about the valuation even in our case success rate was not very high in greenfield projects promoted by first generation entrepreneurs however we continue to show interest in this sector

875010 he was the cornerstone of my band for a long time

875012 the relentlessness and regularity of the schedule just proved to be a little bit too much for hiram
875013 i think he was the greatest guitar player ever with the exception perhaps of jimi hendrix nobody was ever better
875014 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times

875016 in the midst of exhausting prison camp relocations marching in a column of prisoners in the gloom of bitterly cold evenings with strings of camp lights glimmering through the darkness we would often feel rising in our breast what we would have wanted to shout out to the whole world if only the whole world could have heard us

875027 the woman with the voice of authority who calls the rain
875028 we would all have wanted for more years to enjoy her company

875034 oh my god wait dont answer that this is revolting
875035 the production of gold is expected to stay flat at around 2 430 tonnes this year
875036 i would want prices to go up but the market is not ripe enough to absorb any hike on the contrary prices could come down as demand dips by 15 20 per cent around this time of the year as a result of rains
875037 this quarter april june year on year government taxes and duties were up 15 per cent and fuel costs alone rose by a staggering 41 per cent the quarter also saw an unprecedented increase of 24 per cent year on year in the cost of principal inputs including coal power fly ash and gypsum
875038 unless the industry is able to recover cost increases through suitable adjustments in selling prices through rational economic considerations the cement industry will be under pressure
875039 not long ago i was importing coal at 65 a tonne the bags used to pack cement now cost rs 7 50 as against rs 6 a year ago
875040 cement prices are stable this is not the time when we can pass on the input cost push there is a reduction in overall demand owing to monsoon and import is also putting pressure on prices
875041 the story of heroic martyrdom the noble fight for the right cause and something that americans were losing sight of as the country became the most powerful nation on earth the underdog standing up to the bully
875042 i think the heart of it is that idea that the men in the alamo willingly gave their lives that it was a deliberate sacrifice for some sort of ideal of freedom or liberty
875043 are not always walking hand in hand i find its very intriguing to burrow beneath the myth and find the truth
875044 for generations it was a story that painted the event in simplistic terms good americans versus bad mexicans the stain of vicious cruelty was painted on all mexicans tejanos were tainted by the alamo for generations
875045 is part of the lore of western expansion and of the defense of democracy you cant visit san antonio and not stop by the alamo
875046 from a foreign affairs and homeland security perspective theres nothing more important than addressing that issue
875047 what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him

875056 our initial focus has been on the colluvial iron ore and we are on track to finish the resource calculation in this quarter the drilling of the adjacent hematite bif was to gain an understanding of the further potential on the leases we will wait until we establish commercial production of the colluvial iron ore before we come back to fully test the hematite bifs but it is clear that the hematite boulders and the hematite bifs which will not be included in the upcoming resource statement add to the potential of the project

875059 voc s conhecem o paradoxo em que estamos gra as internet temos mais leitores para o nosso grande jornalismo do que em qualquer momento de nossa hist ria mas tamb m gra as internet nossos anunciantes t m mais escolhas e n s temos menos dinheiro
875060 sab amos vinte anos atr s que o filme ia acabar voc s n o usam mais c meras de filme o que n o pod amos dizer era quando isso realmente aconteceria de maneira que haveria c meras digitais e computadores em n mero suficiente para que a imprensa os usasse a mesma coisa acontecer com o papel
875061 tenho acompanhado empresas nos eua que j trabalham dessa maneira ali s e uma exig ncia ter estas qualifica es para poder trabalhar na determinada empresa acho uma confus o muito grande uma s pessoa poder produzir essas m dias todas ao mesmo tempo durante uma reportagem alias acho imposs vel fazer isso com qualidade infelizmente qualidade n o tem sido a preocupa o maior das empresas que adotam essas medidas na verdade elas s se preocupam com o dinheiro
875062 quando voc pega muitas coisas voc n o est fazendo bem nenhuma
875063 essa id ia de backpack journalist eu acho que s serve para determinado tipo muito especifico de jornalista como por exemplo os correspondentes em uma guerra com esse tipo de perfil ai sim backpack journalist uma coisa obrigat ria porque voc trabalha sozinho precisa de tudo em nossos ambientes atuais de jornalismo para 98 ou 99 dos jornalistas este tipo de trabalho n o funciona multim dias s o as reda es n o os jornalistas
875064 o nico receio que eu tenho dessa tend ncia a querer aproveitar o mesmo profissional para fazer meios diferentes ent o o fot grafo muito diferente do cinegrafista e da pessoa de texto e da pessoa de som e acho que um meio profissional precisa de ter um profissional para cada coisa
875065 a fotografia tem um grande futuro na multim dia a prova disso que um dos produtos que tem mais sucesso na internet nos jornais s o as galerias fotogr ficas muitas delas com udio s o as galerias fotonarrativas
875066 usar as fotografias para contar hist rias implica que o jornalista tamb m compreenda a linguagem do udio tenha conhecimento de como fazer uma entrevista de forma que o fotojornalista se transforme num rep rter visual para poder contar hist rias para poder narrar hist rias pessoais de pessoas que moram num lugar
875067 certos conhecimentos de fotojornalismo levam voc a fazer melhor v deo e vice versa s o linguagens diferentes mas complementares tem que ser compreendido para o trabalho do fotojornalista que diferentes classes de hist rias de diferentes naturezas t m que ser contadas de jeitos diferentes usando ferramentas diferentes o v deo adequado para algumas hist rias o fotojornalismo adequado para outras

875083 after the rain no one council member wants to answer their phone because everyone has the same problem
875084 i dont think were doing a very good job addressing those two issues part of the problem is the resources its expensive we have an old system and its a huge strain on it
875085 we have a lot of young families moving into the fourth and a lot are opting out of schools
875086 we need to market the schools so people consider them as an option
875087 they move out because they dont have confidence in the schools bottom line i dont think we do a good job of selling the schools weve got fisher elementary and southampton theyre both really good schools and we dont get that word out
875088 i think people have a lack of confidence in the ability of richmond public schools to run its business efficiently in light of all the audits and stuff like that
875089 personally because i spent a good part of my career involved in government and accountability its one of the things im going to work on
875090 it has a huge social impact on community stability and an economic impact
875091 these are families that very invested in the success of their children theyre making a decision with their feet and saying richmond public schools is not meeting our needs or theres the perception that they arent meeting the needs
875092 the air is stagnant the windows have grayed from time and i would like to see huguenot high replaced with a new building and at an earlier timetable than that which has been proposed
875093 research has shown that more involvement typically increases school performance
875094 one of the things i want to do in the 4th district is what i call the three ps partnering parents with principals just like in the local schools in westover hills
875095 we need to get people in the neighborhood to work with the principal to find some way to put kids in that school so it will work for them look at fox and munford as examples and more recently linwood holton where the community has worked with school to make it work for their children
875096 i think theres a need to be innovative in our approach in educating the children of richmond or in an urban area
875097 when we look at stats like 50 percent graduation rates there is something that we are not doing correctly and we need look at programs like a very strong vocational and technical program expanding the international baccalaureate and affording options to parents
875098 were losing experienced teachers and becoming more of a proving ground to train teachers and once they get a few years of experience theyre out
875099 i have a lot of experience and i know about these issues that are going to occur in the next legislative session and the impact they will have on students in nevada
875100 they focus on adult issues and forget about the powers given them to rewrite policy and regulations as we focus on student learning
875101 recently i gave a presentation to the board at which time i had to turn to the president of the board and say will you please control the board so i can continue my presentation
875102 it was a public meeting and i was embarrassed for the board i want to bring a sense of professionalism to the board
875103 they have their minds made up and they dont change them and they dont read or understand the information
875104 i understand the fiscal needs of a school district and the professional development needs of staff
875105 the graduation rates have deteriorated and the number of high school students who have to take remedial classes because theyre not ready to go to college has grown
875106 it would save money and reduce conflict that can occur between licensed teachers trying to decide whos the captain
875107 we formed a task force and made suggestions and one of the things we implemented is when textbooks are adopted
875108 the school boards now send something in writing that says they match the standards
875109 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
875110 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
875111 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
875112 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
875113 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
875114 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
875115 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
875116 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
875117 we only had 27 presale tickets for all 10 days of the event
875118 first of all i will tell you i can track most of those attacks to a single source and that source is a former contracted employee who was terminated and paid in full
875119 they had some issues with the bands that were involved and with the staging crew and everything got canceled
875120 it was a brand new event that the promoter was trying to pitch to us and we always try new things at the sands because we need to bring new people into reno and new people of that age group into reno so we gave it a shot
875121 unfortunately the promoter was not strong enough to carry through with his obligations thats the bottom line
875122 up until a couple of months ago we hadnt planned on having the event so our revenue stream will be just fine with hot august nights
875123 the biggest issue on our end is that we took such a short run at this
875124 we began planning it only six weeks ago and if i could go back and change one thing i would have waited a year to do it the second thing is i would not have started with a 10 day event but instead shrunk it down to three or four days
875125 just someone who was born and raised here or whos been in the area for 35 years
875126 children today grow up in smaller families and now socialization has to occur in school instead of the home
875127 bring back the little red school house on a bigger scale
875128 they should learn music and how to draw with paper and pencil as a skill because we are living in a changing society and they need skills
875129 you get great teachers by paying them what they deserve
875130 i would raise teachers pay but there would be a trade out we dont want any bums on the payroll who dont do anything but teachers who are qualified to teach
875131 if we set a goal for the state of nevada to be number one in education and work for that goal and mean it we will find the means both financial and the talent
875132 we have an economic downturn right now but we always have enough money to fight a war and we never question where the money will come from i want to fight a war on the lack of teaching our children to become good citizens
875133 i decided the best way i would be able to continue with my passion for education and the contribution i have been making is to deal with it on a statewide level
875134 in addition to the state board of education there are seven boards and commissions that i know of
875135 im sure they were created with good intentions but many of these board and commissions are not required to check with the state board we have to collaborate with these commissions and boards and the governor to ensure our kids get the best education
875136 we are the mother lode of renewable energy as valuable as silver was on the comstock
875137 we love elegance as well as functionality i really think they are on to something

875143 many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the 2020 olympic games wherever theyre held
875144 with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the international cricket council to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
875145 the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread the word of cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently dont play our sport
875146 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations
875147 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport
875148 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
875149 do whatever you want its only hair itll grow back
875150 even if the ban is not fully lifted we may export 2 3 million tonnes after november to some african countries

875152 there are not many acquisition targets currently in india but we may look at the potential opportunities in the internet space that are aligned to our business model if valuations correct
875153 we had been approached as potential takeover target prior to going public but we have always made it clear that the company is not for sale and moreover there have been no approaches ever since the companys listing

875161 it is better to fight them over there so we dont have to fight them here at home
875162 perhaps its because we have been brainwashed into believing that iraqis are expendable second class muslims who we have cast as synonymous with terrorists and not worthy of much news coverage

875210 there were still some people in this country who hadnt yet heard recorded music

875235 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the western australian liberal party he said
875236 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
875237 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges he admitted
875238 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
875239 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
875240 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
875241 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record

875246 thus says the lord of hosts the god of israel
875247 lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
875248 glory to god in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will
875249 thus says the lord of hosts the god of israel i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon 3 within two years i will bring back to this place all the vessels of the lords house which nebuchadnezzar king of ba bylon took away from this place and carried to babylon 4 i will also bring back to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and all the exiles from judah who went to babylon says the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon
875250 amen may the lord do so may the lord make the words which you have prophesied come true and bring back to this place from babylon the vessels of the house of the lord and all the exiles 7 yet hear now this word which i speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people 8 the prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war famine and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms 9 as for the prophet who prophesies peace when the word of that prophet comes to pass then it will be known that the lord has truly sent the prophet
875251 thus says the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebu chadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years
875252 listen hananiah the lord has not sent you and you have made this people trust in a lie 16 therefore thus says the lord behold i will remove you from the face of the earth this very year you shall die because you have uttered rebellion against the lord
875253 but the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or who speaks in the name of other gods that same prophet shall die w hen a prophet speaks in the name of the lord if the word does not come to pass or come true that is a word which the lord has not spoken the prophet has spoken it presumptuously you need not he afraid of him

875255 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
875256 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else

875408 the nervous ones were still further alarmed by a general stampede of the miners on the south fork of the merced which occurred in the summer of that year 1854 this was caused by a visit to their neighborhood of some pai utes and monos from the east side of the sierras who came to examine the prospects for the acorn harvest and probably take back with them some they had cached

875656 oil prices are causing hardship amongst those who can least afford it replacements are not up filling the gap of cheap oil and current biofuel policy only allows the government to avoid making difficult decisions on increasing demand for energy
875657 time is running out for planned change to renewable and sustainable energy sources and soon we will have restrictions on growth forced upon us this means working people will likely go without essentials of food and transport we saw that in the 1970s oil shocks and the recession that followed
875658 this is an economy where people are on edge about things like downsizing and getting laid off and heres a guy who has wielded that knife
875659 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
875660 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
875661 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering
875662 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
875663 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
875664 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
875665 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
875666 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
875667 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
875668 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
875669 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
875670 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
875671 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
875672 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
875673 lei la signorina gamba avrebbe appuntamento alle 9 20 ma la signora rondelli non c la facciamo passare

875676 ah ma stamattina era impossibile percorrere questa via in auto ho fatto un quarto dora di coda
875677 eual ha visto come sono brava a togliere i denti del giudizio
875678 both of them had very good demeanor in the huddle
875679 they dont know which groups in there but theyre having fun doing it its going to be a heck of a battle
875680 i think having last year too under my belt and getting some experience at playing and having this offseason to get through this offense helps
875681 its great to work with two veterans like marc bulger and trent green who are so accurate
875682 its definitely a lot of volume in this offense but we create a lot of mismatches
875683 ive enjoyed learning it i feel like im picking it up more and more each day
875684 if something opens up i like to use my legs to the best of my ability
875685 i think i always felt like i could play here but you needed to see the results for that extra boost
875686 miles said there were things i could do better and that he thought i could hit here that meant a lot you tell yourself you believe in what you can do but its helpful to show what you can do
875687 i like the impact extra base hits there and hes hitting the ball as well as anybody better than most
875688 i like the idea that you get some sock there even if i dont really fit the spot like that
875689 its a great place to hit its one of the best places to hit in the big leagues but it fits mather more than me
875690 when you dont get that playing time sometimes you go up there worrying about not striking out and sometimes you just want to let it go
875691 hes never played off the bench and there are things you can do when youre not getting at bats every day to make sure youre ready when you do
875692 i was feeling for it a little bit it was a matter of getting comfortable settling on an approach i think you always wonder if the power the production is there until you see it
875693 its been frustrating to say the least but theres a couple of reasons why he hasnt protested i have a lot of respect for the guys in here who am i to complain about this or that and i want to keep playing so i dont want to burn bridges and make it a public issue
875694 is when his foot was hurt thats when i got the most playing time so i definitely wasnt going to complain
875695 this was very unexpected and i very much appreciated it
875696 its a new challenge pinch hitting is tough but its my job
875697 i remember being at practice and id get down on myself because i couldnt catch certain balls and extend my arm but im loose 100 percent and ready to play
875698 he had contact his first scrimmage and then in 13 games he had contact only 14 times and none in the spring so what he was able to accomplish without having contact is almost amazing
875699 some of his natural instincts were taken away he said
875700 i know he took some hits where he stopped in his tracks and i dont think he was always as physical as a runner as he normally would be
875701 when you have a guy who comes up and says im going to return punts im going to return kickoffs thats what you want
875702 you never wish for anyone to get hurt but when you get your opportunity you should take advantage of it
875703 but the starting thing is not really a matter to me because i start on certain other packages and i also start on special teams so im a starter either way
875704 im really glad we were able to play him at the end of the year hes had a taste of it
875705 now hes moving into potentially being our starting strongside linebacker not discounting what chris draft is going to do for us but we feel really good about quinton
875706 were probably moving ahead with that a little bit sooner just because of mark not being in there
875707 but thats good all along thats a scenario weve been considering were just working it now
875708 the more things you can do in this day and age is very valuable for your team
875709 we worked so hard and put so much into it a qc and barrister doing it pro bono without charge i havent had the guts to read the judgment its quite nauseating
875710 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
875711 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
875712 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
875713 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
875714 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in and then in the end i made some bogeys
875715 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
875716 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
875717 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
875718 i tried to hit it as close as possible so i didnt leave myself any putts
875719 the guys on the radio said shauns coming hard you gotta go he actually came across the start finish line in front of me by about a half boat length we got side by side and i think one of the guys on the inside of us kind of skipped out and he got up in their wash thats what gave me the opportunity to get by him thats just part of racing it was wild out there
875720 once i got by timmy i pushed real hard and got close
875721 i just waited for my spot and took the chance once rinker got me back i realized i got to maintain my second because im not going to get him
875722 but i got down to the commitment buoy and i said theres no red boat fleming to my left he didnt start my crew chief got on the radio and said jose is a lap down so i just kept it cool and got around john jorewicz and took her home for a victory im really speechless
875723 thats why i get smoked off the beach so bad

875752 theres no one thing that you can do that is going to fix the problem but when people think about this area they often look to isps to provide the silver bullet

875756 isps arent the ones who should decide whats legal or illegal and neither should afact
875757 if they think someone is breaking the law then they should do the same as everyone else in this country does and report it to the police
875758 they afact can keep on skirting around this and keep on trying all other things but ultimately if youve got a class of people out there who are consistently breaking the law you dont sit around and bitch and moan about it you go out and charge them

875769 the norwegian committee sn k 185 has a meeting on march 28th and will discuss the outcome of the brm and what will become the final norwegian vote
875770 it is correct that there was a majority of the members in the committee that considered the comments not taken into consideration to a sufficient degree
875771 the committee therefore focused on the treatment of the received comments from the public

875774 sc 34 is the jtc 1 designated maintenance body for iso iec 29500 office open xml file formats the passage of iso iec 29500 has instituted a new era of standards activity in sc 34 related to document formats iso iec 29500 does not represent an isolated phenomenon since sc 34 is also responsible for iso iec 26300 and for interoperability between these and other projects sc 34 envisages the creation of three distinct working groups that meet the needs of iso iec 26300 work on interoperability harmonization between document format standards and wishes to incorporate existing expertise on these standards for these reasons sc 34 hereby establishes an ad hoc group pursuant to the jtc 1 directives clause 2 6 2 for investigating how the first of these groups may be set up most effectively
875775 iso iec dis 29500 office open xml file formats has received the necessary number of votes for approval as an iso iec international standard sc34 recognizes that ecma tc45 members have in depth knowledge technical expertise on iso iec 29500 and will seek to preserve and allow for inclusion of this existing body of technical expertise in sc34 sc34 therefore invite ecma tc45 members to attend and fully participate in iso iec jtc 1 sc 34 ad hoc group 1 iso iec jtc 1 sc 34 ad hoc group 2 as well as in any future working group that will be dedicated to the maintenance of iso iec 29500 sc34 intends to organize an efficient and timely process for maintaining and handling new work items to insure the evolution of the standard in following the jtc 1 directives
875776 eu was one of those that demanded that microsoft submit its formats to iso
875777 eu competition commission might order microsoft to disclose all the parts of the ooxml specs that are at present undisclosed
875778 in any case it is clear that the eu can do a number of things regarding ooxml that microsoft would not like
875779 yes we are being investigated but everything we did was entirely legitimate so we are quite sure that the eu will decide we are innocent and not take any unfriendly actions
875780 not to mention alex brown who consults the british library a key microsoft proxy for the standard and who made the uk approve the broken standard
875781 i think the present case with ooxml is similar enough that we can be pretty sure microsoft is going to lose again
875782 we the undersigned participants at this sc 34 meeting wish to make it clear that we deplore the personal attacks that have been made during the dis 29500 standardisation project in recent months we believe standards debate should always be carried out with respect for all parties even when they strongly disagree we call on all organisations and individuals involved in sc 34 standardisation to support this view and to refrain from initiating or engaging in any such personal attacks
875783 i still dont see that the eu has any providence in this matter the iso is a private organization not a government one
875784 i do believe that microsofts move towards the new formats originated from concerns by customers
875785 i believe there are two sides to every file format the competitors who might be discouraged by a more cryptic format and the partners who will be encouraged by a more open format i am guessing that with ooxml the second part far outweighed the first one as various government agencies started to climb on the scales and ooxml ended up much more open than old binary formats
875786 dont engage the anti ooxml forces with explanations their tactic now is to accuse iso of corruption thus making it even more difficult to create international standards by bnegotiated consensus
875787 i was part of a nortel networks group in 1997 that was visited by three microsoft reps who came specifically to get feedback on changing the binary ms office document format to an open standards based one
875788 microsoft says its intention with ooxml is that it be a truly open standard i say it is lieing and that its intention is to keep it under its own control and use it to prevent competitors such as open office from gaining market share
875789 luc get your facts straight odf became iso iec 26300 2006 on november 30 2006 on precisely the same day microsoft office 2007 was released to enterprises office 2007 was in development for more than three years by that time there is no way to add something as big as odf support to something as huge as office 2007 in zero time are you saying that microsoft should have implemented odf as it was rubber stamped by sun and ibm in oasis it was a very raw and ooo so centric standard at this point not yet scrutinized by iso not that it ever were anyway implementing odf fresh out of oasis oven less than a year and half from the release date would be insanity no suicide
875790 in the case of ooxml although the foundations were laid a long time ago as you mentioned the end users waited until very recently to see it happen
875791 does ms intend on supporting odf out of the box in ms office
875792 i agree that it is profitable for office to use an open and standards based file format but i also believe that it is only the case if competing products are not fully compatible
875793 however the world is the way it is business managers are supposed to make decisions based on the way the world is not on how someone believes the way it ought to be otherwise the shareholders will revolt and replace those managers with some other group who will do their product strategies based on the reality of the situation do you have a problem with this
875794 what about the specifications of these formats when were they first released to the public
875795 its like trying to make sense of a lost episode
875796 the custom schema support in open xml is really just the starting point of semantic documents and it takes a small step in the new voyage we need to help convince the rest of the world to take
875797 but may i ask for your help were did you manage to find xml experts in jamaica cyprus malta kazakhstan lebanon azerbaijan fiji to do a reveiw of ooxml and confince them to join iso to vote
875798 super fast track process which is guaranteed to take no longer than two weeks
875799 the standard that made iso abolish the fact track process
875800 updating our products so that they support the iso version of open xml
875801 import filters also exist for lotus 1 2 3 applix sylk xbase open office quattro pro dif plan perfect and oleo files but these import filters are less complete
875802 you will have been notified that norway voted to approve ooxml in this ballot this decision does not reflect the view of the vast majority of the norwegian committee 80 of which was against changing norways vote from no with comments to yes
875803 is it worth owning ooxml while being so thoroughly hated by everyone
875804 we disapprove the draft iso iec 29500 for the reason that the time given by the fast track processing is not enough for consideration of this important draft
875805 and for that matter why would ibm care its sun whos behind microsofts main office competitor not ibm
875806 there was a standard it was called odf ever heard of it but microsoft decided an existing standard wasnt good enough
875807 and many others 17 of 43 iso p members in total
875808 we dont approve ooxml and propose that ecma submit it as a technical specification
875809 regardless of the original motivations on either side maybe the fact that the oxml specification is open documented and its evolution is now controlled by iso
875810 wow if the anger and vitriol in the comments on this blog from both sides prove anything its that this event has further widened the gap between the software freedom people and the microsoft people
875811 microsoft did nothing to block odf even voting yes for both iso and ansi certification of odf and not lobbying governments to ban use of odf
875812 they are a little tweaked that with representatives of almost 2 3 of humanity voting against ratification the standard still made it through with some several hundred critical comments not addressed
875813 i dont want to use it as an iso standard so nobody can
875814 your implication that ibm can control both india and mainland china and two billion people the nbs of which both voted no is not credible ibm is good just not that good
875815 you have the nerve to make that statement while at the same time suggesting that microsoft does
875816 right now were still waiting on the final version of the spec to be published at which point we can start to talk about how to support it as well as move into maintenance
875817 falls das geld nicht versteuert wurde haben wir den anfangsverdacht der steuerhinterziehung dann schalten wir die steuerfahndungsstelle ein

875819 the committee s 142 u 34 under danish standards could not agree to change their vote from no to yes
875820 chair of the committee has been barred from speaking about the result of yesterdays meeting
875821 2 3 of the folks wanted to approve the format so their submission is now approve rather than abstain
875822 nl rule is in our favour so it must be applied finland rule is not in our favour so it is ok if it is not applied
875823 it is an awkward situation for e g finlands ministry of justice that already made the decision to use odf and deployed it everywhere what if other ministries choose ooxml are we soon having two ministries using odf and four using ooxml for me a finnish tax payer and a citizen who needs to deal with those ministries this situation doesnt look cost effective at all i would prefer that all our ministries would the same format it would make my life easier too
875824 as long as microsoft participates in the revision process to completion microsoft irrevocably commits to apply the osp to that future version of is29500
875825 there is a silent economic revolution thats taking place in kumbalgodu and its vicinity
875826 we know each of the families personally their problems background everything it helps us to identify the cohesiveness of a group which is essential in forming a well knit self help group
875827 im not racist so therefore solving racism is about changing those other
875828 even though minorities have endured centuries of enslavement and abuse racism is really all about white people in the end
875829 margins have increased for two reasons the first is because there has been a decrease in the amount of competition in the market
875830 most home buyers or people refinancing their loans know there are financial booby traps waiting so theyre on the lookout for scams and junk fees
875831 theres no purpose for both these fees other than to pad profit
875832 in my opinion thats like a restaurant charging you more for napkins
875833 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own
875834 with the way things are going it may be something a lot more people are realistically doing
875835 i watched the prices go up when i went to the supermarket id say wow this is 3
875836 you put a little seed in and it comes to maturity like a child
875837 i have a 30 person waiting list for a new garden
875838 its not only the high cost of food but the high cost of every other activity people are staying around their homes and looking to do things they find rewarding
875839 i think the thing that tipped the scale was the fuel and food costs
875840 we ordered three times as many fruit trees as ever before
875841 we sold out of all the vegetables in june seeds too
875842 were sick of rising fuel and food prices so were turning this weed patch into a vegetable garden want to help
875843 were doing eight quarts of spaghetti sauce from the yard right now weve got so many tomatoes
875844 i never thought theyd be able to run through a field of corn and sunflowers in new york city
875845 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
875846 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
875847 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
875848 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
875849 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
875850 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
875851 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
875852 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
875853 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
875854 i said sure what can come of such a case
875855 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
875856 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
875857 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
875858 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis
875859 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
875860 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
875861 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
875862 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
875863 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
875864 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
875865 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
875866 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
875867 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
875868 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
875869 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
875870 that facility could have taken care of me any day
875871 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
875872 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
875873 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
875874 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
875875 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
875876 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
875877 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
875878 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
875879 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
875880 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
875881 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
875882 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
875883 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
875884 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
875885 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
875886 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
875887 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
875888 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
875889 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
875890 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
875891 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
875892 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
875893 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
875894 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
875895 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
875896 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you
875897 many children and women were shouting for help and i saw people tumbling down the hillside
875898 there were rumors of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
875899 we need more medicines and blood but we are trying to do our best with what we have
875900 there were too many rumors we tried our best to keep things under control but it went out of hand
875901 this is a little like saudi arabia announcing its going to conserve oil
875902 because we are such a water rich part of the globe weve never had to conserve water the fact were doing it now not only shows its important to us but a signal to the rest of the world it has to start doing the right thing
875903 my intention is to move this and move this fast
875904 its not the container size its the commodity were worried about it
875905 theres an opportunity for commercialization if you start shipping water out of the basin in bottles the dam has broken and everybody will be after our water
875906 the epa requires no new action by oceangoing vessels from a scientific standpoint theres plenty of literature showing ballast exchange is really ineffective
875907 weve been doing it in the great lakes for almost 20 years and we still get a new invasive about every 28 weeks
875908 the fact that leaders from around the nation have said yes to this is a signal that they see the great lakes as not just a local swimming hole but a national icon
875909 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
875910 there are british passport holders who live in the uk being found in places like kandahar
875911 there are very small numbers of british citizens traveling out there being trained up and then returning to the uk
875912 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
875913 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
875914 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
875915 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
875916 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
875917 to mention anything concerning a person that he would dislike
875918 these results show that the japanese see the future of the bilateral relations in a negative light while the chinese are more optimistic about them

875938 piracy is the way to get established and get your name out theres no way to stop it so were using it to our advantage
875939 its this really gritty tacky sleazy jungle music its just genius
875940 its making it possible for every kid in brazil to know their songs by the time they turn five
875941 its actually good for a lot of money you give it away and it will come back thats literally true with information not with property
875942 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
875943 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
875944 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists
875945 before you couldnt get your record played on the radio if you couldnt afford payola now if a song hits big with the aparelhagens the radio has no choice but to play it
875946 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
875947 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
875948 as well as we knew each other and the way the labs were run someone would discover what was going on
875949 especially since dry spores were not something that we prepared or worked with
875950 i cant imagine him being involved in a scheme to make money or to make a profit especially one that would put people at risk or even die
875951 thats not the bruce we knew he was sweet friendly i mean he was into grass recycling
875952 as far back as the year 2000 ivins has actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning
875953 he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
875954 because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
875955 at one point he said the leaders hid in the
875956 actions with respect to a threat to the peace breach of the peace or acts of aggression
875957 fuck it youre never going to want to quit its never going to be convenient so stop pussyfooting about and get on with it already
875958 im a few years shy of my sexual prime that happens anyway
875959 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
875960 the pattern and string of attacks has been escalating against the research and science community here as well as at other university of california campuses
875961 the dark knight i realized that to my knowledge there hasnt been a musical based on music from any band of my generation ish
875962 i cant help it the road just rolls out behind me be kind to me or treat me mean ill make the most of it im an extraordinary machine
875963 ive come to find i may never know the changing mind is it friend or foe i rise above i sink below with every time you come and go please dont come and go cause i am barely breathing and i cant find the air dont know who im kidding imagining you care and i could stand here waiting a fool for another day i dont suppose its worth the price that i would pay but im thinking it over any way
875964 we all begin with good intent love was raw and young we believe that we could change ourselves the past could be undone but we carry on our back the burden that time always reveals in the lonely light of morning in the wound that would not heal its the bitter taste of losing everything i held so dear ive fallen i have sunk so low im messed up better i should know so dont come around here and tell me i told ya so
875965 here and now will we ever be again because i have found all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again she says that love is for fools that fall behind and im somewhere between
875966 hey your glass is empty its a hell of a long way home why dont you let me take you its no good to go alone i never would have opened up but you seemed so real to me and after all the bullshit ive heard its refreshing to see that i dont have to pretend she doesnt expect it from me so dont tell me i havent been good to you dont tell me i havent been there for you just tell me why nothing is good enough you know i dont understand you deserve so much more than this
875967 aint it funny how your new life didnt change things youre still the same old girl you used to be
875968 day after day love turns grey like the skin of a dying man night after night we pretend its alright but i have grown older and you have grown colder and nothing is very much fun any more and i can feel one of my turns coming on i feel cold as a razor blade tight as tournequet dry as a funeral drum dont look so frightened this is just a passing phase one of my bad days
875969 be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
875970 people of good will disagree about whether america should have gone to war in iraq
875971 iraq was a diversion from the fight against the terrorists who struck us on 9 11
875972 from childhood he hadhrat maseehullah saheb has been the repository of modesty dignity respect forbearance ingenuity intelligence and commendable attributes ausaffe hameedah
875973 when the darkness of the nafs and the impurities of character are eliminated by means of constant zikrullah and abundance of spiritual exercise and abstinence and the heart and soul gain a special and a distinguished relationship with allah taala then certain spiritual mysteries and esoteric knowledge enter the heart intuitively and inspirationally without the agency of the senses or other external material mediums
875974 true dreams and this is the tafseer of allah taalas statement and for them there are bushraa glad tidings in this worldly life
875975 we transfer dua to you whoever comes to you for dua make dua on their behalf
875976 mustajaabud dawaat one whose dua is readily accepted by allah taala
875977 i happened to be present in the khanqah when hadratwaala hakeemul ummat said a teacher is required there you proceed to jalalabad when i came here to jalalabad there was one haafiz saheb and two rooms haafiz saheb taught in one room and i in the other
875978 verily allah taala will not eliminate knowledge by way of extracting it from the hearts of servants but he will eliminate knowledge by taking away the ulama and when there no longer remains an aalim people will take for their leaders the ignorant they the ignorant ones will be questioned and they will issue verdicts thus they will be astray and lead others astray
875979 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
875980 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
875981 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
875982 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
875983 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
875984 weve got three world class assets and two of them are copper and theyre brand new
875985 one hasnt even been commissioned yet and the other one only started three years ago
875986 the thing with us is everything is in front of us and even our century zinc mine in queensland has got another eight years of mine life
875987 its a very large operation and would have to be juicy for potential suitors i would have thought
875988 im not too keen on that happening because id like to hold on to my job for a bit longer
875989 the russians are coming in and vale out of brazil are moving heavily into projects in this part of the world
875990 these guys are doing it because there is money to be made
875991 there is obviously a situation at the moment where they are pulling back a little bit
875992 theres the olympics out there and they just dont want to be seen as perhaps too aggressive
875993 theyre going to have some stiff competition with vale and norilsk coming out of the woodwork in a very big and aggressive way
875994 if theyre doing it in copper im sure they will do it with nickel
875995 espero que el personal est completamente de acuerdo en que s lamente los ni os rubios deber an salir en los videos
875996 this report shows that more than 50 per cent of existing teachers would meet those accomplished standards
875997 what we require now is a commitment on the part of government with additional targeted funding to progress this proposition
875998 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
875999 i am concerned that the aeus proposal would mean that more than half of the nations teachers would qualify for this professional pay
876000 performance pay should be for those who actually perform at the highest level and should be something teachers strive towards it shouldnt be easy for anyone and everyone to qualify
876001 the ieua looks forward to working with our colleagues in the government school sector to achieve these agreed outcomes
876002 ive had the figures checked and the trend is stable or down
876003 i think the lock out has contributed substantially to improved safety and amenity in those late night entertainment precincts
876004 and the lord who commands armies traditionally the lord of hosts will make for all the nations on this mountain a banquet of meats a banquet of wine dregs meats filled with marrow dregs that are filtered
876005 the face of the shroud the shroud over all the nations
876006 for the hand of the lord will rest on this mountain
876007 he will bring down his pride along with the of his hands
876008 he will bring it down he will make it touch the ground even to the dust
876009 one of firm purpose you will keep in peace peace for in you he possesses trust
876010 the path of the righteous that you prepare is straight
876011 your name and your remembrance is the desire of our being
876012 those who live in the world learn to live in a righteous manner
876013 they do not learn to live in a righteous manner
876014 they will see and be ashamed of zeal of people
876015 for according to what our deeds deserve you have acted on our behalf
876016 o lord in distress they visit you they pour out an incantation your discipline to them
876017 for all that you smote leviathan the slippery ugaritic bariakh translated
876018 lest someone visit harm upon it night and day i guard it
876019 he makes peace with me peace he makes with me
876020 like the striking down of the one striking him down does he strike him down
876021 or like the killing of his killed ones is he killed
876022 and this is all the fruit of removing his sin
876023 so in this way through judgment jacobs sin will be
876024 de la misma manera que los chanantes escaparon de lo pythonesco

876043 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players

876045 that dose not help sell partner products or software solutions
876046 the thing we need is an architecture that combines the full programmability of the cpu with the kinds of parallelism and other special capabilities of graphics processors and that architecture is larrabee
876047 it is not a gpu as many have mistakenly described it but it can do most graphics functions
876048 it looks like a gpu and acts like a gpu but actually what its doing is introducing a large number of x86 cores into your pc
876049 larrabee does not require a special api larrabee will excel on standard graphics apis
876050 so existing games will be able to run on larrabee products
876051 and of that population two suppliers ati and nvidia own 98 percent of the discrete gpu business

876166 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
876167 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the ved budget changes will be on emissions from second hand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
876168 breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
876169 however we are seriously concerned that even the projected differentials between ved bands remain too small to be effective and in consequence the projected carbon savings are far less than they could be we also believe that both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated

876174 the thing we need is an architecture that combines the full programmability of the cpu with the kinds of parallelism and other special capabilities of graphics processors and that architecture is larrabee
876175 it is not a gpu as many have mistakenly described it but it can do most graphics functions
876176 it looks like a gpu and acts like a gpu but actually what its doing is introducing a large number of x86 cores into your pc
876177 larrabee does not require a special api larrabee will excel on standard graphics apis
876178 so existing games will be able to run on larrabee products
876179 and of that population two suppliers ati and nvidia own 98 percent of the discrete gpu business

876214 rasulullah saw berpuasa hingga kami menyangkakan baginda tidak akan berbuka dan baginda berbuka hingga kami menyangkakan baginda tidak akan berpuasa aku sama sekali tidak pernah melihat rasulullah saw menyempurnakan puasa sebulan melainkan pada ramadan dan aku tidak pernah melihatnya lebih banyak berpuasa melainkan pada syaaban
876215 hikmah lebih tepat untuk dikatakan berhubung persoalan ini iaitu meningkatkan amalan puasa pada syaaban adalah seperti yang disebutkan hadis dengan darjat lebih sahih daripada hadis terdahulu
876216 aku bertanya rasulullah saw ya rasulullah aku tidak pernah melihat engkau berpuasa dalam satu bulan berbanding bulan lain seperti engkau berpuasa daripada sebahagian syaaban baginda bersabda itulah bulan yang manusia melupakannya antara bulan rejab dan ramadan iaitu bulan yang diangkat amalan kepada allah tuhan semesta alam oleh itu aku suka supaya amalanku diangkat ketika aku sedang berpuasa
876217 nabi saw tidak berpuasa pada satu bulan yang lebih banyak berbanding syaaban sesungguhnya baginda berpuasa sebulan penuh
876218 imam al tirmizi menukilkan daripada ibn al mubarak katanya menurut bahasa arab apabila seseorang berpuasa pada sebahagian besar daripada sesuatu bulan maka boleh dikatakan dia berpuasa sebulan penuh dikatakan seseorang itu solat sepanjang malam padahal ada kemungkinan dia masih makan malam serta sibuk dengan urusan lain
876219 tetapi jelas sekali pendapat ini boleh berpuasa sebulan penuh ketika syaaban seakan akan terpaksa namun pendapat paling sahih adalah pendapat pertama iaitu baginda hanya berpuasa sebahagian besar daripada syaaban
876220 baginda saw tidak pernah berpuasa sebulan penuh sejak datang ke madinah selain ramadan
876221 jangan sekali kali salah seorang antara kamu semua mendahului puasa ramadan dengan puasa sehari atau dua hari kecuali orang yang sudah biasa berpuasa pada hari itu justeru dia bolehlah berpuasa pada hari itu

876263 high levels of support often observed for governmental and religious systems can be explained in part as a means of coping with the threat posed by chronically or situationally fluctuating levels of perceived personal control three experiments demonstrated a causal relation between lowered perceptions of personal control and increased beliefs in the existence of a controlling god and defense of the overarching socio political system a 4th experiment showed a challenge to the usefulness of external systems of control led to increased illusory perceptions of personal control a cross national data set demonstrated that lower levels of personal control are associated with higher support for governmental control

876347 it has been 18 years since the americans with disabilities act passed theres so many places where people with disabilities still have problems
876348 theres some good stuff in there but some very negative things also
876349 i am very keen that there will be rules to ensure access for individuals with vision loss to all of the technology systems present and future that people use in their everyday lives
876350 things like cellphones atm machines computer systems anything where there is an on screen display should be designed in a manner that would permit its use by an individual with limited eyesight

876358 the security personnel stationed at the park check the rides before letting in any visitor there are also seat belts for safety in every ride said an official of the amusement park
876359 i am satisfied with the temporary campus and im very excited about the campus
876360 iit patna has turned out to be better than what i had
876361 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the western australian liberal party he said
876362 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
876363 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges he admitted
876364 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
876365 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
876366 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
876367 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
876368 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics

876374 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
876375 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
876376 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
876377 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
876378 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
876379 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
876380 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
876381 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
876382 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
876383 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
876384 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
876385 who are open to doing something on the production side
876386 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
876387 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
876388 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
876389 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
876390 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
876391 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
876392 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
876393 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
876394 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
876395 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
876396 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
876397 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
876398 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
876399 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
876400 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
876401 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
876402 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
876403 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
876404 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
876405 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
876406 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
876407 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
876408 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
876409 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
876410 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
876411 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
876412 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
876413 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
876414 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
876415 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
876416 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
876417 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
876418 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
876419 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
876420 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
876421 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
876422 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
876423 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
876424 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
876425 ive been here since 1979 when i graduated high school
876426 it gives me something to do instead of staying at home all day i love every minute of it
876427 we can be an industrial business just like any other place and we used to be
876428 we used to not just do petty little projects theyre capable of doing amazing things
876429 ultimately i would imagine the development of the place would take place to the east
876430 so im going to say that as guests come into the site in the future theyll come in therell be a museum or visitors center over there and then therell be footpaths other travel paths that will help them get to the house
876431 one of the great things about this story this place is that because of the west of the brazos community there are a lot of deep roots of families who are still here who have connections to the 19th century and beyond
876432 the show we did at the cotton bowl we got hundreds of letters
876433 he had a certain way of bringing out the best in 350 kids
876434 we did a lot of drills college bands wouldnt attempt to do
876435 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
876436 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
876437 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
876438 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
876439 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
876440 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
876441 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
876442 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
876443 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
876444 darn i took some extra photos i wish i hadnt
876445 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
876446 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
876447 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
876448 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
876449 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
876450 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
876451 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
876452 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
876453 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
876454 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
876455 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
876456 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
876457 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
876458 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
876459 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
876460 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
876461 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
876462 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
876463 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
876464 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
876465 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
876466 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
876467 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
876468 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
876469 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
876470 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
876471 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

876499 michener was one of the most dynamic educators i have known he stimulated youth to comprehend interrelationship s among all fields of knowledge
876500 this long book of 18 linked short stories is i am convinced a substantial achievement which will make mr
876501 that was the associated press tales of the south pacific just won the pulitzer prize for fiction
876502 i gave my reasons for nominating tales and the board accepted them that prize initiated the public and critical awareness of michener that assured his subsequent literary prominence and success
876503 im going to wash that man right out of my hair
876504 michener is a man of many moods and a loner and his interests are varied one might be put off by his reticence but his modesty and humility are genuine
876505 if ever a magazine was designed for a writer the readers digest was designed for james a michener teacher patriot student of the world and optimist the combination of magazine and writer was a perfect fit one that has been rarely repeated in the history of publishing
876506 hawaii is a masterful job of research an absorbing performance of story telling and a monumental account of the islands from geologic birth to sociological emergence as the newest and perhaps the most interesting of the united states
876507 with hawaii i finally found great faith in myself as a writer
876508 if you save one dog you wont change the world but surely the world will change for that one dog
876509 the more also will it show itself to be petty narrow rigid and illiberal
876510 social mobility in general with special reference to post war mobility

876513 as the shadows of evening fell in my dreams i saw the uplands of tomorrow
876514 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the western australian liberal party he said
876515 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
876516 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges he admitted
876517 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
876518 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
876519 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
876520 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
876521 professor dewey has made a great difference in my thinking

876564 millers plays were less elaborate than those of eugene oneill more approachable than those of tennessee williams and more theatrical than those of clifford odets
876565 with the passing of arthur miller goes the last of the great dramatists eugene oneill tennessee williams miller of the american century
876566 mr millers death last week meant the loss of a great public thinker who believed strongly that the essence of america its greatness was in its promises
876567 death of a salesman is the great american domestic tragedy the crucible is the american political tragedy which he wrote to protest the horror of the mccarthy era
876568 la bucure ti ne au b tut cu 4 0 dar scorul putea sa fie mai mare steaua era o echip extraordinar dar s v explic ceva n preg tirea meciului am urm rit casete de la derbyurile cu dinamo pot s v spun c dinamo avea o echip mult mai bun ca steaua atunci la adversara noastr era un juc tor de geniu hagi dar dinamovi tii aveau o echip excelent cu mul i juc tori care puteau face diferen a puternici dar ti i i voi cine era eful stelei nimeni altul dec t tiranul ceau escu finala pe care au pierdut o cu milan a fost ceva ireal pentru ca diferen a nu era a a de mare
876569 youve left me with nothing but i have worked with less
876570 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
876571 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
876572 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
876573 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
876574 offering some of the steepest pitch at jackson gore they have lots of character with natural outcroppings and contours to enhance the way these trails will ski
876575 attendees of the conference leave feeling that they have more in common with each other and a deeper understanding of the importance of diversity and community
876576 its the host country that has primary responsibility for monitoring and keeping an eye on whether there are in particular ticket scams
876577 thats why when the sydney olympics were on we didnt have this problem and i guess its ironic theres been so much said about internet access in terms of the beijing olympics and we still have this major international scam
876578 there is no better evidence that individual privacy simply does not exist in googles world than by the chilling amount of detailed visual information google now collects on all of us information that any internet user can now compile in a dossier in less than 30 minutes
876579 ive always acknowledged there is work to do i do concede there is an opportunity for the liberal party to win the next state election
876580 i have formed a view a very strong view that we have a far better chance of election victory if there is a change
876581 maybe their moms and dads never taught them how to treat other people
876582 why would their moms and dads not teach them that
876583 like a dog with a bone i was not going to let go
876584 if you fail polygraph or violate probation you go back before the court
876585 im going to tell them there are miracles out there
876586 wired the short life and fast times of john belushi
876587 that guy you brought us here to see that guy
876588 im in a long run too and i know its difficult to give night after night people come to see you and you blew the show off there are those of us who appreciate it do it for us
876589 how is it that you look so totally relaxed on stage and so in command
876590 because thats the only place i know what im doing
876591 if you can ever find out what lenny is taking by all means do it
876592 took his work seriously you have no idea how seriously he took it pinned his entire life on it and he had courage not just through the drugs but in his art
876593 and by then the needle will be in my arm and ill be six feet underground and therell be nothing you can do to stop it
876594 well what i did i happened to see brando in a picture called reflections in a golden eye in which he played a homosexual not long afterwards i saw capote being interviewed on tv and i suddenly realized hey brando was doing capote now if brando can do capote and i can do brando well then i can do capote
876595 obsessed with marlon brando john belushi polishes off a slice of pizza stuffs the greasy napkin into his cheeks and becomes the godfather
876596 the brando character in fact runs through much of belushis hilarious impersonations at second city but it never overtakes him because beneath the macho mafioso pose always beats the vulnerable heart of a hippy dippy chump belush has only to step on stage to get laughs
876597 but a funny thing happens at second city a year after youre there you start to get this fear that youll die there and you start wondering when youll leave
876598 the pizza had turned into specks of sausage and cheese scattered in the deep dish baking pan
876599 i think the lease is a bad idea the numbers theyre predicting theyll get from the lease are too high and ive got a major problem with giving one of our major assets to a foreign country maybe our governor better take another look at what hes doing
876600 but as gov rendell has expressed it needs to be determined if leasing the turnpike will produce significantly more funds to finance the needed improvements to our transportation infrastructure and i can only consider the idea of a lease if that is proven to be the case
876601 but they also want more toll roads so theyre dealing with two conflicting priorities
876602 theyre going to do a quick but thorough study of the application
876603 i dont think it can qualify there was no impact study no diversion study im not discouraged after talking to them
876604 the dirty russians wanted us to fight i told my driver when we go to the yugoslavia border open the doors and put a white flag in front of our tank then we turned back to town
876605 twelve years under the communists we can do no more
876606 because when he was there he showed no emotion at all
876607 he said he heard a thud then stopped the truck looked back and got out
876608 he said demou was walking back to the restaurant when he started to pull away
876609 the counselor went to look again and didnt see the boy
876610 maybe well never know if a lifeguard would have saved this person or not but it wouldnt have hurt
876611 perhaps we should have had hearings before that decision was made
876612 it was honorable work but the level of resources provided were not enough to bring it where it needs to be
876613 im looking forward to moving forward and making a difference
876614 i think it depends on the i 80 tolling application
876615 if they turn us down i think theres a very good chance of passing the turnpike lease
876616 loses 12 8 billion immediately and billions more over time
876617 pennsylvanias state leaders should be the primary decision makers regarding this plan and the federal government should not second guess their decisions
876618 when you know or should have known that someone is on that truck and you dont stop that is a crime
876619 the monumental audacity to go home imagine that that is his big sin
876620 a young woman has lost her life here as a result of an accident not a crime
876621 this race and this country and this life produced me he said i shall express myself as i am
876622 we hope we brought smiles to the kids and their families who are dealing with this life changing illness
876623 the ultimate goal is to get the kids their siblings and parents out on the slopes so they can enjoy each other and have fun
876624 its overwhelming how powerful the complimentary season passes were to our families
876625 these families entire lives revolve around their sick children having family time on the snow was incredibly therapeutic and fun they would not have had this opportunity had it not been for the kids skiing for kids program at shawnee peak
876626 our goal next year is to get at least half of our families involved in the ski program
876627 i watched other people read books asked questions and made lots of mistakes
876628 we like to do a lot of different things so we dont get bored
876629 when you can buy an end table made in china for 19
876630 around here reproduction is the r word it sounds like something from kinkos who wants a copy we take the best design and construction ideas from the past and make something original and unique
876631 were trying to push our craft as far as we can
876632 we focus on what we could have done better anything thats not exactly right
876633 the work they produce is first rate by any measure
876634 whats special about doug is how much energy he spends researching whats appropriate and he has guys working for him who are seriously into it combine that with the materials he uses and the result is awe inspiring
876635 people who have made a whole lot of money and want something that will hold its value
876636 we get to execute furniture at the highest level for clients who appreciate it
876637 everyone goes wow when they first see it we want them to go wow three years later as they continue to discover all the hidden details
876638 if thats the way you approach life its amazing what you can accomplish we push as hard as we can to make the nicest pieces of furniture we can we have fun we make people happy and we make some really neat stuff
876639 this was his second job just to pay all the bills
876640 there are always going to be people you disappoint by doing it
876641 they realize i have family here in america america is my future and its been so good to me ive helped out australia now its time to push americas chances for a gold medal
876642 a big part of the athletic partnership is the horse the horse is probably the real athlete
876643 im a rider but im also the trainer of the horse so i have to get the horse prepared for its job we work on everything their dressage work their jumping their fitness work but youve got to win his trust and confidence
876644 you have to understand that horses being so big and strong you really cant force the issue
876645 if they wanted to they could just say im not doing that so you have to try and present it in a way that they enjoy it and want to do it the key is finding the really capable ones the one gods given a gift you try to get them to the highest level once there you have to savor that and preserve it for as long as you can
876646 because of the hills and the great footing a lot of early horsemen were attracted to the area
876647 bruce davidson and michael matz were here jonathan shepherd the access to veterinarians and horseshoers and the care of the horses is probably as good as anywhere in the world
876648 the australian equestrian federation was pretty good about it they released me
876649 there were rules and criteria but they took into account that i had represented australia three times in the olympics and at four world championships its not as if i just did a little bit and then ran away
876650 but this will be the first time im wearing the red white and blue against the guys with their green and gold so it will be a little bit different im sure there will be some ribbing
876651 theyre looked after so well they get food and water brought to them unless theres rough weather its actually a lot smoother for them to fly than it is bouncing up and down on a highway
876652 the u s has been in a bit of a rebuilding phase
876653 but i think well have a good chance with the heat and conditions in hong kong it should be an open field
876654 i wasnt very high profile in this country at the time but id won the gold and someone said this would change my life everything will be different
876655 good teaching requires an understanding of how technology relates to the pedagogy and content
876656 with the rising tide of boomer retirees employers will be losing key talent at a time when attracting and retaining skilled workers will be more important than ever
876657 it s the type of situation where you wrap your arms around someone and make an ad hoc one on one arrangement
876658 we may be at a very opportune point where employer and employee interests are converging
876659 its definitely something that has always existed in urban areas but its really just in the last 20 years that now every little town has a farmers market
876660 to fill up a tractor now is like 300 or 400 it used to be 60
876661 theyre businesspeople so theyre going to be figuring out the dollars and cents of all of it
876662 the way one explained it was for large stores and supermarkets they can cover some of these costs with very incremental raises
876663 you can take something from 2 89 a pound to 2 99 a pound the consumer doesnt even really notice
876664 a lot of these people just feel very strongly about supporting their local businesses and local economy
876665 and some others consider it more environmentally conscious to buy locally
876666 mortgage fraud and foreclosure scams are among the fastest growing and the worst complaints
876667 i even received a call from the public defenders office because theyve seen a rise in the number of people they are defending as a result of fake check scams
876668 i complained that i had no shoes until i met a man that had no feet
876669 ive pissed away three booms in my lifetime but this time no
876670 with the price of oil like it is we should be able to get this paid off while the price is still up
876671 boom times are back for now but resource driven regions like the permian basin face a recurring dilemma
876672 at the bottom of every cycle when the oil industry is shrinking and times are tough nothing is pursued with more fervor than industrial diversification
876673 yet on the way up the oil industry can be so profitable it pushes other businesses to the side
876674 and its something that people are thinking about all the time
876675 we dont issue dogmatic statements and impose dogmatic principles that is intervening and invading on the freedom of the conscience of the people when a person is christianity nurtured and his conscience is shaped by christian principles that person should have the freedom to manifest his or her attitude toward specific problems such as abortion or the forms of abortion the church does not get involved in that kind of detail jesus never never imposed anything upon his followers if you want to inherit the kingdom of god do this do not do this if you want that is the greatest characteristic feature of christianity the washington post 1 20 96 p b6 his holiness patriarch bartholomew of constantinople when he visited san francisco in 1990 made the following statement on the orthodox position on abortion although the orthodox church believes the soul enters the body at conception and generally speaking respects human life and the continuation of the pregnancy
876676 respects the liberty and freedom of all human persons and all christian couples we are not allowed to enter the bedrooms of the christian couples
876677 we cannot generalize there are many reasons for a couple to go toward abortion
876678 as for abortion this is always profoundly dramatic for a woman and deeply injures her femininity for this reason abortion for the sake of convenience is we cannot deny it extremely serious and must be strongly discouraged but there are situations of extreme distress when abortion can be a lesser evil as for example when the life of the future mother is in danger
876679 all human life is sacred hence it is sacred from its inception until death
876680 unequivocal opposition to any action that would abridge the right of a woman to reach an informed decision about the termination of her pregnancy or that would limit the access of a woman to a safe means of acting upon her decision
876681 you also wrote then bring charges and follow church law and tradition in orthodox tradition isnt there precedent for throwing them over a cliff
876682 il mio nel pozzetto ero di niente il suo dito copiosamente che ci vedere da sotto i coglioso non si sdraio e coscia poi il suo penetro subito
876683 mia dannato le tempie fremevano ad osservivano a pareva uscii da questo confessare sexy calendario natale
876684 its pretty hard to view this as minimal or nonserious it involves animals dying and animals being paralyzed with broken backs

876768 el protestantismo es por su esencia teol gica un fen meno plural las reformas protestantes llevaban consigo una pluralidad de organizaciones religiosas de modelos eclesiol gicos que s lo con muchos distingos permiten hablar de protestantismo desde un punto de vista gen rico aun cuando al principio exista un com n denominador m nimo fundado en estos tres grandes principios sola fide sola gratia sola scriptura esta diversidad y este pluralismo han constituido la fuerza de los protestantismos pero a la vez ponen hoy en d a de manifiesto su car cter precario
876769 durante los a os veinte y los treinta en un contexto de violentas luchas e ideolog as se redobl la campa a cat lica que denunciaba a las sociedades protestantes como
876770 por una parte el catolicismo de neocristiandad sosten a un modelo org nico y corporativo de sociedad que correspond a a su propia estructura de gesti n autoritaria de las cuestiones religiosas
876771 la expansi n de las sociedades pentecostales y de los nuevos movimientos religiosos no corresponde ni a una forma delcatolicismo popular ni a una renovaci n interna del protestantismo pero si constituye una renovaci n de la religi n popular en el sentido del parche bricolage que lleva consigo una aculturaci n de los protestantismos hist ricos hacia las pr cticas y los valores de la cultura cat lica popular
876772 la asimilaci n de los protestantismos latinoamericanos por la cultura religiosa y pol tica de los milenarismos y de los mesianismos queda ahora de manifiesto m s en la continuidad que en el rompimiento con eluniverso religioso y cultural de las sociedades donde prosperan por esta raz n cabe preguntar si hay motivo para emplear el t rmino protestantismo cuando se habla de esos movimientos o si se trata m s bien de nuevos movimientos religiosos sincr ticos que seinscriben en la estrategia de una eficacia simb lica de resistencia o de adaptaci n a la modernidad a trav s de un parche religioso producido por los sectores subalternos de las sociedades latinoamericanas
876773 con todo es cierto que la principal manifestaci n de la resistencia y del conformismo pasivo se encuentra como lo se ala lalive depinay en la protecci n que ofrece la sociedad religiosa sectaria al individuo al encerrarlo en una contrasociedad y en una cultura religiosa subalterna
876774 la cultura religiosa y pol tica de los pentecostalismos y de los protestantismos latinoamericanos actuales es autoritaria y vertical
876775 teniendo en cuenta la evoluci n global de los protestantismos latinoamericanos desde la segunda mitad del siglo xix hasta nuestros d as forzosamente sorprende la mutaci n que han experimentado en el transcurso de los ltimos treinta a os
876776 en t rminos generales es l cito afirmar que los protestantismos y pentecostalismos latinoamericanos de hoy en d a son sincretismos con la posible excepci n de las iglesias de transplante y de algunos organismos nacidos de las iglesias hist ricas m s bien constituyen un renuevo de la religi n popular en el sentido del parche de resistencia y de elaboraci n de una nueva relaci n con la modernidad
876777 ahora bien los protestantismos latinoamericanos del siglo xix en tanto que sociedades de idea han sido precisamente el instrumento ultraminoritario de conformaci n de una opini n p blica a trav s del debate y de la reinvindicaci n del libre arbitrio

876808 goodiss 1946 novel dark passage made a considerable splash it remains one of his best known books the only one in fact that really made it into the mainstream today its appeal derives less from its none too believable plot it was one of the early new face through plastic surgery stories than from the authors obvious identification with the persecuted hero and from the jazz like pulse of the prose hero and heroine are drawn together in part by their taste for count basie with the sale of serial rights to the saturday evening post and the movie rights to warner brothers goodis had arrived dark passage became a bogart bacall vehicle and goodis went on the warners payroll as a staff writer he was not yet 30 and his career had already peaked
876809 during the hollywood years goodis lived in the l a home of a lawyer friend renting not a room but a tiny uncomfortable sofa for 4 a week at a time when as a movie writer he could have lived well goodis apparently refused to spend money on anything not out of miserliness but from a sheer perversity which also led him to drive the same dented chrysler convertible virtually his whole adult life a car so miserable that his friends refused to be seen in it his clothing as his lawyer friend recounts was equally grotesque he wore my old suits and when they were worn out he had them dyed blue apparently his whole wardrobe was blue one day he invited me to eat at the warner commissary dan duryea was there and dave was wearing one of my white suits which was all yellowed and stained duryea asked him where he had dug up the suit and david replied coldly that he had bought it at gordons one of the best tailors in philadelphia when duryea remarked that the suit wasnt even ironed david gave him a pitying glance and explained that that was how it was meant to be worn he also had an old bathrobe of mine he went out at night in it when he wore it he pretended to be a white russian an exiled prince of the blood goodis would borrow labels from his friends finest clothes and laboriously sew them into his own wretched hand me downs all for the peculiar pleasure of stopping people short when they criticized his clothing
876810 a central law of goodiss fiction is that happiness is forbidden all true love remains unconsummated all petty criminals a breed with whom the author identifies are caught ignominiously all proud old men are humiliated all virgins are molested

876834 the whole team is dangerous including ladesma because they will come to ibrox and be excited about the atmosphere to play in that stadium is something special he is good at set pieces and free kicks but i dont think he is so good physically he is brazilian of course rangers are a much bigger and better team in all aspects so we must beat them and go through to the next round

876845 the bottom line is that a simple mistake in our motion to convene in closed session is what occurred
876846 in light of these circumstances we have agreed to expedite the processing of appropriate minutes of the closed session and we have agreed to arrange for open meetings act training with the attorney generals office
876847 on behalf of the village you have made the commitment to expedite the processing and release of the minutes of the closed session and have agreed to arrange for open meetings act training for the board
876848 the sale or purchase of securities investments or investment contracts
876849 to the extent that such discussions were held the board appears to have violated the acts requirements
876850 because the scope of the discussions held during that closed portion of the meeting remains unclear
876851 a financial services firm that specializes in municipal and economic development financing and planning services
876852 we in the audience at the workshop could hear the discussion but there were gaps in our comprehension of what was involved because we could not see the documents being talked about
876853 for further review and evaluation of which portions of the meeting were appropriately closed
876854 it appears that the village violated the acts requirements by discussing matters outside the scope of the exception relied upon
876855 it is our view that the discussion should not have occurred in a closed meeting because the presentation of such information in itself is not part of the boards deliberation on whether or not to purchase the real property
876856 our goal in handling these cases is to mediate a reasonable resolution with the public body that furthers the publics interest in information and results in greater awareness and future compliance with the act by the body in this case we will consider the matter closed once the minutes of that meeting have been made public and training arranged we have concluded that this resolution is sufficient to provide the public with information about what occurred during the closed meeting without contradicting the statutes provisions as to the circumstances under which a public body can be forced to make closed meeting recordings available for public inspection

877126 lolz teh d00ds r n eet 2 make teh blingz who cares abt art i sure dont no sir not me
877127 i appreciate the devils advocate stance here which can be more aptly summarized as
877128 it is infact their cultural responsibility as cultural gate keepers to search out great art and expose it to a broader audience im suprised this even has to be said they clearly do not conduct such efforts anymore because now the industry is entirely enfatuated with money i do think the established presses have an obligation to find art again im amazed that i have to say this seeing as how they have a hegemony on the available resources and theoretically can take more risks than anyone else
877129 how about publishing some expirimental fiction instead of another doggie book spin off hihi rent seeking or dean koontz spin off hihi rent seeking or crappy political celebrity garbage if they want to publish steven king and paris hilton or lindsey lohan i am completely fine with that just use the profits gleaned from such ventures to take risks on exciting non traditional fiction dont use it to publish more bland fiction that everyone has already seen everyone talks so much about diversity on their web pages lets see some
877130 you can interpret it as devils advocacy if you like but publishers have no more responsibility to publish art as opposed to rubbish than writers have to satisfy an audiences hearts desire in fact i think thats the bargain right there in a nutshell if you think the industry is only lately infatuated with money then you are unfamiliar with the history of the industry which certainly has never been in the business to lose money
877131 its not that the best work goes unpublished as lml points out it just doesnt necessarily count for much in the market so what i come across your argument again and again it never makes sense
877132 we business people do not see where the efficieny or profit lies in the painting of a ceiling in the vatican we also see a great waste of resources occuring in certain middle parts of france and wtf is a villa deste we cant even pronounce that not approved
877133 the thing is they actually do use the profits gleaned etc they buy a whole mess of books for a big five grand apiece and then throw them at the market like you might throw a big platter of spaghetti at the wall and then as with the individual strands of spaghetti see what sticks
877134 i wonder why dante wrote the comedy in the vulgur and not in latin
877135 well we dont know for sure but certainly it might have been an artistic choice no
877136 but the argument that literary art depends for its very survival on a certain arrangement of economic forces does not compute
877137 if great literature doesnt matter much in the market yet texts that are in excess of 2000 years of age and are still kept around by the erudite portions of humanity then the market is not an apt judge of what is and is not valueable in regards to literary matters
877138 actually it is because he was attempting to standardize the language and address himself to a broader audience since only scholars possessed the ability to read latin
877139 such an argument was never advanced or even slightly asserted in any of my posts

877142 you continue to expect mainstream readers and their guides the mainstream reviewers to choose challenging fiction over more familiar books whence your drive i dont perceive any optimism in your tone nor a push for finer humanities education that would grant readers the tools to access difficult non realist texts

877345 we wanted to get the national night out celebration back into the neighborhoods because we thought it was important for people to get out and get to know each other and the people on their blocks

877347 what is it in the quality that you are frightened about
877348 we do not want amateur or black market sale or distribution of lsd

877350 why do you not want the indiscriminate manufacture and distribution is it because it is dangerous
877351 theres no such thing as bad acid just acid thats made wrong
877352 after 1966 my lectures and writings were mainly concerned with a general theory of psychological and political relativity and made little mention of lysergic acid which in truth had been driven completely off the scene by owsley speed orange amphetamine and the more commercially and socially acceptable cocaine heroin trade
877353 i dont particularly recommend you take lsd first of all 99 percent of what they say about it isnt true
877354 i cant really recommend acid because acid has become an almost meaningless chemical
877355 with perhaps the exception of owsleys work every bootleg batch ive tried from then on down has been interesting enlightening agonizing bizarre etc but never anything as pure
877356 of 405 samples said to be lsd 91 6 percent were as alleged 3 4 percent had no drug at all 3 percent were actually dom pcp and others and 2 percent had dom pcp and methamphetamine in addition to lsd
877357 marshman and gibbons tested 519 samples of street drugs for which the vendors claimed composition was available of the samples alleged to be lsd 44 percent contained lsd with two or more contaminants or even were mixtures of intermediate chemicals resulting from the failed attempts to synthesize lsd
877358 the free base as well as the tartrate of d lysergic acid diethyl amide like all lysergic acid derivatives is very sensitive to light and oxidizing agents all preparations must be stored carefully protected from light and from oxygen of the air to prevent them from being destroyed within a short time

877388 the national water initiative is visionary in its focus on conducting the research and development necessary to solve water supply problems before we face a national crisis
877389 for instance population growth could lead the united states to increase its water consumption by 62 by 2040 however if better conservation methods are employed that number could be cut to 29
877390 the proposed national water research and development initiative will ensure that the u s will be the leader in creating solutions for a crisis in water availability that is already impacting the quality of life of many u s citizens
877391 it is our fervent belief that this coordination is essential to our nation s success in addressing water management issues both now and in the future
877392 after a series of starts and stops the future of the proposed north shore casino faces its most critical deadline this week the state gaming control board must decide whether to approve transferring the pittsburgh license from don barden who was unable to complete financing to a group headed by chicago billionaire neil bluhm mr bluhm said last week that credit suisse which had given mr barden a 200 million bridge loan to get the project started could force the project into bankruptcy as early as wednesday mr bluhm said hes willing to take over the project and keep all of mr bardens commitments but wont act on the bridge loan payment until he is sure his group has the license

877395 state gaming control board chairwoman mary d colins said s he didnt feel intimidated or threatened by a 60 second phone call from state rep dwight evans who stressed the importance of continued black ownership in a planned pittsburgh casino
877396 the realization after years of steady healthy gains that the gaming industry isnt immune to the distress of a troubled economy couldnt have come at a worse time for massachusetts
877397 we need to balance the need for obviously opening the casino as soon as we possibly can with the reality of we have to get it right this time because were in the pickle that were in now because we didnt get it right the first time
877398 as the mayor of the city representing the taxpayers and all of the interests of the city of pittsburgh i think its at least reasonable to ask them to sit down and talk with me talk with the county executive before they make any decision on the future of the slots license
877399 there has to be more transparency the taxpayers and the residents of the city have to know what decisions are being made why theyre being made who these people are what their backgrounds are this was a thorough process that resulted into where we are today
877400 should they use the new team or should they go out for a new operator its hard for me to make that decision not knowing what they have to consider the gaming control board
877401 whatever happens to the troubled pittsburgh casino project the facility should remain on its under construction north shore site and all promises to the city penguins and neighborhood groups must be kept mayor luke ravenstahl said in a wide ranging press conference this morning marking his return from vacation he said that in spite of an ownership shakeup he believes a casino could open here next year bringing promised city revenue but to make that happen he wants a series of meetings involving himself allegheny county executive dan onorato the state gaming control board and the prospective new majority owners of the majestic star casino

877403 don barden wont need to sell fitzgeralds to maintain a stake in a slots only casino in pittsburgh but the downtown las vegas casino remains an asset he could use to generate cash for his struggling gambling portfolio
877404 if barden did want to sell his las vegas property now is a tough time to put it on the market in recent months a number of downtown properties have changed hands including the sale of binions to terry caudill of las vegas for 32 million but the economic slowdown has investors running away from gambling deals with even big name casino stocks such as las vegas sands and mgm mirage trading at a fraction of what they did late last year
877405 theres no need for the wisdom of solomon when someone as rich as solomon antes up mr bluhms timely arrival should remind our rubber stamp happy officials that even in an economy that supposedly doomed mr bardens undertaking theres plenty of money to be made here thats good reason to hold our own at the table if one developer doesnt like our terms another will show up soon enough over and over again though pittsburgh politicos fail to appreciate what a great hand theyve been dealt i know table games havent yet hit the banks of the three rivers but really if they want this to be a world class city theyre going to have to learn to play world class poker

877408 i tell ya ravenstahls got to be taking a big dookie in his underoos about now pittsburgh needs the majestic star to be a glittering north shore jewel complete with packed restaurants varied shopping options and that fancy river amphitheatre not some ugly multi story hunk of concrete that sits lifeless on the river while inside those jonesing for just one more pull on the slot machine fork over their paychecks who would you trust in making sure its the former and not the latter the gung ho businessman who you can look in the eye and remind of the promises he made or the faceless real estate fund operators who really just want to recoup their 120 million investment

877412 a nasty june swoon at the resorts 11 casinos could be evidence that atlantic city is heading for a second straight down year in terms of revenue the gambling halls took in 373 6 million in june an 11 percent decrease over the same month a year ago only one of the 11 casinos saw revenues increase last month and of the losers eight posted double digit declines experts say the size of the decline may be too steep to be offset by july and august crowds traditionally the busiest months of the year in atlantic city challenges facing atlantic city include the expansion of gambling halls in connecticut continued competition from pennsylvania slots parlors high gas prices and a partial smoking ban that will become a total ban in september
877413 any public support that still exists for the foxwoods and sugarhouse casinos at their proposed riverfront locations in south philadelphia and fishtown respectively is running out faster than a slots player goes through a fistful of quarters
877414 remember the khian sea the cargo ship dubbed the flying dutchman of debris spent 14 months in the 1980s sailing the globe with 14 000 tons of philadelphias toxic incinerator dust in search of a landfill know whats like the khian sea philadelphias proposed casinos the big boxes of slots keep moving in search of a final resting place turns out citizens dont want them in their neighborhood which is a problem because philadelphia you may have noticed is a city of neighborhoods local and state representatives who like to get reelected are fighting the current locations call it nimde not in my district ed

877418 negotiations between barden and bluhm over control of the casino had hit some sticking points said rendell spokesman chuck ardo
877419 i have never felt very comfortable with mr barden he reminds me of a carpetbagger i find it amazing that the parking garage that was under question has made it up to 10 floors while the casino itself is a steel shell
877420 hooray for the bi partisan efforts of ferlo and orie to push for re opening the bidding process if control of pittsburghs casino venue is awarded to the same group that now controls casino operations in philadelphia the whole idea of gambling as a revenue source becomes less transparent and is in the hands of too few
877421 i think our two senators have done what many have thought about in proposing to strip don barden of his casino license now it is time for the commission to act accordingly
877422 the new deal should fizzle this whole scenario is beginning to smell like three day old dead fish this board will rubber stamp this new deal without any investigation that seems to be standard operating procedure for them barden should not own one crumb of this let alone 25 percent the board should refund his 50 million if bluhm wants the pgh location let him shell out 50 million more
877423 so mr barden did not really have the wherewithal to execute on his plan and now he is not even the winner that the state city thought they picked because he has lost control i have been following this since the beginning and his finances have always seemed suspect but we are all happy to have a new arena and keep the penguins
877424 unbelievable so now elected officials will unabashedly get involved to preserve a single investors stake in a casino the majority chairman of the house appropriations committee who controls the annual budget of the gaming board engaging in a conversation with a board member on behalf of don barden a troubled casino investor and working to obtain assurances on behalf of new investors i wonder what evans did to prevent barden from being totally removed from the deal
877425 to have some high roller with capital step in and buy the rights precludes anyone else who could offer the taxpayer a better deal it is incumbent on the gaming board to get the best deal possible for the taxpayer and this is not it

877427 bethlehem already is reaping the benefits of the sands bethworks casino even though it wont be completed until next year the last beam of its steel structure was set in place near the end of june which means the construction is ahead of schedule the city already is gaining revenue while this casino project is doing well on just about all accounts the same cannot be said for other casino projects that are struggling through birth pangs elsewhere in pennsylvania the boards decision on sands as the bethlehem licensee it looking better all the time
877428 david levan wants to try again the man whose plan to build a casino near gettysburg drew national attention and significant local opposition in 2005 and 2006 said wednesday he has the financial backing he needs to take a second shot at securing a slots license for adams county levan said he intends to do exactly that if a license becomes available something that seems increasingly likely investors in valley view downs a proposed lawrence county casino and horse racing facility are struggling to refinance the 455 million project before the state gaming control board finishes its investigation and decides whether to grant them a license if investors in valley view downs are forced to withdraw their application then i will get very aggressive levan said i wanted to send a message that if they dont i can he said there is an alternative out here this time around levans proposal will include plans for a horse racing facility and be located somewhere in the southern part of the county away from the gettysburg battlefield and near the maryland line
877429 his vow to keep future casino proposals away from the gettysburg battlefield might appease some of david levans former opponents but the businessmans most vocal critic remains far from satisfied theres no place in adams county thats far enough away to not contaminate the atmosphere of this community said susan star paddock who headed the local citizens group no casino gettysburg which played a key role in defeating levans 2006 bid to build a slots parlor near gettysburg

877433 i dont think don barden should be allowed to transfer the license he was awarded it he defaulted the runner up should get it when miss america is caught in a porn scandal she doesnt get to choose who gets the crown after shes been stripped of it does she um
877434 anyone in pittsburgh or hell in the whole tri state area who was not yet convinced that the pennsylvania gaming control board made one of the biggest most boneheaded blunders in the history of the commonwealth when it awarded this citys casino license to don barden and his majestic star house of financial cards you should read the lets face it inevitable piece that the pittsburgh post gazette s mark belko posted about a half hour ago
877435 taxpayers shouldnt be left holding the bag for the 7
877436 so now the fancy brick promenade outside the new majestic star casino wont be so majestic or so star like in fact there wont be any bricks at all just some cheap concrete and the upscale outdoor crosswalks in the original plan also are gone set to be replaced by some cheap native grasses or maybe some native weeds if things keep coming apart in any case unless dan onorato slips majestic star casino owner don barden some landscaping cash out of the overflowing funds from the drink tax it looks like the majestics grand entrance will be concrete and grass like at pizza hut
877437 the community attributes are disappearing thats a shame whether you like gambling or not this is a monopoly license and i feel there should be some giveback to the community in terms of amenities and thats whats disappearing said anne swager co chair of the gaming task force that reviewed all three bids for the citys lone slots license the issue came to a head last week when representatives for mr barden presented plans to the city planning commission to delay construction of the 1 000 seat outdoor amphitheater boat docks and access paths for three years and to scale back other elements including the amount of trees and shrubs on the riverfront and the amount of brick on the promenade
877438 the impact of the success of the casino is more far reaching than just mr barden and the casino itself how can he realistically follow through with financial commitments to the hill district the penguins and others regionally if he cant live up to his original commitments just to build the casino

877477 the writing i found to be astounding the group of people who are creating the show and then the cast they were assembling and theres an energy to it which i love from having done theater and having made films that shoot quickly
877478 the degree of intimacy that they enjoy sometimes with the people theyre advising or healing whatever you would call it
877479 and how specific and personal they are with their approach how different each person is even down to the way they lay out their office and whether there are private things in the room that they work in or not
877480 theyre very specific about what it requires what good therapy requires and psychology and about it involving emotional intensity and of course as actors were very drawn to people who are emotionally intense because thats how we work so there are some parallels there just in terms of focus that are interesting

877511 the stated drivers as you stated should be equally important and weighted however the singapore green building development so far has implied that no 1 driver is government legislation no 2 is developer amp building related professionals and finally comes the occupants more of a top down than a bottom up approach given the background and typical relationship between the government amp its people on the extreme side christian has also pointed out that perhaps a wake up call of some sort will put all drivers in the driving seats faster in my opinion general public will not start to act until they realize their personal space could be affected as matter of fact i believe singaporean would require a more forceful push than american australian or european to come to a breaking point realization this is due to the fact that majority have the mindset that government will take good care of them if there is any issue government will lead the way to resolve it so very few will act or dare to advance to where government hasnt gone before
877512 from top down practices there have been increasing sustainable awareness and initiatives from developers architects engineers researchers and other building related professionals regardless being ethical or commercial driven reasons such diverse awareness has a common sustainable goal therefore there exist opportunities for reciprocal relationships among the professionals as long as these reciprocal relationships are recognised and nurtured a solid foundation can be formed to push toward sustainable built environment

877542 so there is a priest and a woman on a plane the women asks the priest father i dont go to church that often but could you please do one favor for me just tell me what it is said the priest the woman replied well i bought this hair dryer and i dont want to pay the custom fees when we arrive since ive never used it could you hide this under your priest uniform between your legs perhaps i will do this said this priest but i can not lie to any questions they ask me oh somehow everything will work out said the woman with a smile at customs the priest was asked do you have items that need to be claimed for tax the priest replied i have nothing above just one thing below my waist that has never been used by a woman ok said the customs agent with a smile come through
877543 when i made the woman she had to be special i made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world yet gentle enough to give comfort
877544 i gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children
877545 i gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else
877546 i gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances even when her child has hurt her very badly
877547 i gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart
877548 i gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly
877549 and finally i gave her a tear to shed this is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed
877550 you see the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears the figure that she carries or the way she combs her hair
877551 the beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes because that is the doorway to her heart the place where love resides

877560 were not suggesting that finger length measurements could replace sat tests
877561 finger ratio provides us with an interesting insight into our innate abilities in key cognitive areas we are also looking at how digit ratio relates to other behavioural issues such as technophobia and career paths there is also interest in using digit ratio to identify developmental disorders such as dyslexia which can be defined in terms of literacy deficiencies
877562 for example if you had a group of runners and they were about to start a race i could predict reasonably well who was going to win based on their finger length but i would not be able to predict whether someone was neurotic or not

877585 cornyn sees himself as in two election fights the one in texas being the least important
877586 the one up in washington for advancement within the senate i think he has clearly in mind as well
877587 unfortunately the democratic leadership in congress led by senator reid speaker pelosi and senator obama has erected a political blockade around americas energy resources
877588 sen cornyn calls on democratic leadership to address long term solution to medicare payment system
877589 what some might view as partisan many others would view as a senator simply staying true to his principles and standing up for what he thinks is right
877590 senator cornyn will not apologize for holding senator reids feet to the fire and demanding that the senate take action on high gas prices particularly when so many texas families are getting hit in their pocketbooks
877591 hes got to run against someone because he cant run on his record
877592 if i lost a child i would never stop trying to find out what happened who was responsible
877593 in the courtroom hes strong as iron and knows the law
877594 hes the best trial attorney i ever went up against

877618 the lord blessed me to go forward in marriage july 27 2006 the day after i turned 15 years old

877621 father said the lord would like you to get married tonight now what do you think of that are you willing
877622 we told them the day of the indictments we were going to face that thing
877623 all this is much less than beyond a reasonable doubt
877624 mais nous nous en sortons et passons des moments merveilleux
877625 when you see our garbage trucks start up you never see a big plume of black smoke
877626 you can look under the hood of one of those trucks and it looks like the old cars i used to be able to work on
877627 you dont need an elaborate fuel and pollution control system
877628 you can feel the fuel going through the line when it stops the car is full
877629 theres not much room back there left to put things
877630 these vehicles just couldnt go far enough without having to be refilled
877631 our folks just couldnt always count on making it back to a refueling facility before running out of gas
877632 everywhere i go people want to ask me all about my car
877633 they want to know how it runs it runs just the same as any other car
877634 im convinced that if more city fleets could be converted to using natural gas we could improve the environment use a fuel that we can produce ourselves and free up gasoline supplies for the general public

877653 its just a last ditch effort to keep the scumbag breathing
877654 he never should have been breathing in the first place i dont care i really dont care what anyone thinks about this except texas i love texas texas is in my blood
877655 displayed a callous cruel and cavalier attitude toward the two girls that he had raped and helped to murder surely no juror or judge will ever forget his words or his sordid deeds
877656 im where i am because i made an adolescent choice thats it
877657 my life is in black and white like old western movies
877658 but unlike the movies the good guys dont always finish first
877659 most of our friends abroad have long since come to the conclusion that this country on this topic just doesnt get it
877660 this state is seen as uncaring and hateful and this case is just right on the top
877661 most texans however consider death a just penalty in certain rare circumstances many europeans disagree so be it
877662 unfortunately i doubt that the international community is likely to brush this off as simply the actions of texas in the international community and under all u s treaty obligations the united states is responsible for texas actions
877663 ive pissed away three booms in my lifetime but this time no
877664 with the price of oil like it is we should be able to get this paid off while the price is still up
877665 boom times are back for now but resource driven regions like the permian basin face a recurring dilemma
877666 at the bottom of every cycle when the oil industry is shrinking and times are tough nothing is pursued with more fervor than industrial diversification
877667 yet on the way up the oil industry can be so profitable it pushes other businesses to the side
877668 and its something that people are thinking about all the time

877676 the road problems have just been overwhelming with roads collapsing and washing away
877677 the worst has been repeatedly trying to fix roads that have gone downhill with the rains
877678 so were hoping to get a declaration of disaster so we can get some relief from fema
877679 that lake is like many other things down here there might have years ago been some insight into keeping things a little better like planning and zoning boat waves and so on a lot of people would have fought you a little bit but now its out of control
877680 theres several big elements involved not the least of which are the people who make a living selling boats
877681 theres people who want to fish and not bother anybody and then theres people who want to go out and party and have fun and get wild
877682 no child should have to endure abuse mistreatment or neglect this initiative will help strengthen families to help end the cycle of abuse that impacts thousands of missouri children every year
877683 the grants help provide information about available resources child development and parenting education so families can recognize the need to change behavior and avoid abusive situations
877684 communities know best how to nurture families and promote safe and healthy environments where children can develop to their fullest potential
877685 ctf funding permits our partners to replicate proven prevention programs in a customized way that best suits their communitys needs
877686 weve been planning for it for 17 years and theres been money set aside for a number of years
877687 were confident that the real estate market is going to be strong here and we saw the opportunity right now
877688 we are very excited about the project we believe our prospects are good plus well have a good fit with the chamber being in there
877689 we are on leased property with 1st national bank and have been for over 10 years
877690 the lease was very reasonable nearly gifted as a matter of fact so weve had a great relationship with 1st national and we appreciated that as we continue to grow on the westside the partnership with lobr will be a benefit to us
877691 we felt like we could take them as a good partner theyre a non competitive group and its a good fit that i believe will work out well
877692 we wont turn anyone away up to the last day
877693 we were honored to be asked to assist with the lake ozark shootout this year we are looking forward to having this premier event here on the west side of the lake
877694 coordinating the volunteers has been fun and informative with many new faces and people stepping up to the plate to assist with the event
877695 some are easy to fill with other committees being a little harder to do because of the type of work involved
877696 with that said the volunteers are stepping forward to assist and we believe we will have coverage where they are needed but more would be helpful we will continue to ask for volunteers up to the day of the shootout it is hoped that we will have plenty of volunteers so no one has to work all the time and will have time to enjoy the festivities
877697 hes the symbol of a new generation he believes in ending the war in iraq responsibly we need to make sure it doesnt end up in mass domestic chaos if we elect the right people and we help the president we can turn this country around
877698 they may not be able to vote yet but kids have plenty of thoughts about how things should work after a few conversations with our children about politics and elections we were struck by how much they had to say they began to come up with ideas for some t shirts and lowercase tee was born lowercase tee thinks that while there are plenty of kids tees out there you can click through a thousand of them without finding anything nice and simple and fun pretty soon the grownups around here began to ask for our tees and we added adult sizes to the mix we have some great stuff planned for the future butright now were listening to the kids

877709 man i sure am craving a gooey high caloric food substance i know ill go to cinnabon at the airport while im there maybe ill get a flight
877710 so far our absentees are down a little bit versus 04
877711 i just hope a lot of people get out and vote i think people get confused and think if they vote republican in the primary they have to vote that way in the general election which is not true
877712 and some believe if they dont vote in the primary they cant vote in november again not true
877713 although the changes are minor compared to the original buoy regulations this is a good start
877714 no other state has even gotten close to the amount of buoys on their waterways that missouri has i would like to thank the buoy committee for all their hard work attending public hearings and listening to all the buoy concerns we received many letters and e mails from individuals presenting their thoughts and opinions
877715 i read each one the comments ranged from take all the buoys out to we need to have idle speed buoys all over lake of the ozarks
877716 i would also like to thank everyone who commented because we wanted public interaction in this decision most comments were very helpful individuals gave valid reasons why lake of the ozarks needed to keep controlled area buoys out there some of the comments were evidently written before the person had their first cup of morning coffee but for the most part the comments and remarks were constructive and reflected public opinion
877717 the committee and i held this concern in high regard the missouri state water patrols main mission is safety on our waterways
877718 with the assistance of the lake of the ozarks safety coalition we have gone from lake of the ozarks being the most dangerous impoundment in the nation to one of the three states with the lowest fatality rate per 100 000 registered boats
877719 i would like to thank everyone for their patience while we studied the buoy issues
877720 you can now go to our website to see the changes to the regulations and the procedures to apply for a buoy permit please have a safe summer
877721 the shootout is great we love it it has a history of benefitting the lake area and you dont have to be a member of the professionally racing community
877722 but i hated led zeppelin music you know i hate that kind of music however i love bluegrass and find it much more creative than led zeppelin
877723 la plupart de ces courtiers sp culateurs avaient classiquement modifi s leurs positions la suite des changements de cours
877724 kids this is about our futures make sure all the adults you know get out and vote
877725 by statute the office is to be open every four years on the same cycle as the clerks job so whoever wins will have to run again in 2010
877726 i want to work on a boat like this when i grow up so i am going to write to my congressman wilson to ask for his help
877727 i have never been on it before it is really awesome inside
877728 we are going to send letters to congress to tell them we want this boat saved because it is just too nice to have to go out of service
877729 i really hope the congress will give it another exemption because it would just be a shame to see it shut down
877730 a lot of people here just like to come down to see it when it stops
877731 well you care more about sarah than me happened when we first got married you paid more attention to her at our wedding cause she was crying than me
877732 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
877733 the sharp drop in u s auto sales is probably the biggest reason for the fall in auto stocks today
877734 theres also a view that auto sales elsewhere will also fall because of increasing uncertainty about the world economy
877735 look this is whats going on here thats making me unhappy i need for this to change in order to stay with you
877736 i accept you back unconditionally i accept your dealbreakers too
877737 if your relationship was of any substance and duration there is only one respectable course of action the face to face break up
877738 my nastiest break up was with my ex wife as it was a reason from the
877739 i hate to say things happen for a reason because everybody says that but i believe they do and i have always believed that if i continue to do the right things something good will come from it all
877740 man i think the key to me is this i have been counting down the days to get back on that field once the initial shock of my injury wore off
877741 i just want to help my team win nothing more or less i am so hungry just to get back after it i feel like i want to go outside in the parking lot and play right now and these two guys sitting here with me mccoy and mckillop deserve all the attention they are going to get they are both superstars and both great teammates who work hard
877742 i dont see the sense in saying i was happy to be injured
877743 but we have a lot of great young players and a lot of experienced talented players and i think this year could be special we could win a lot of games we could get to a bowl game and who knows we could maybe even win the big east so there are a lot of things to look forward to
877744 like i said i want to look forward i am optimistic about the future you cant forget what happened but you have to let it go and i have i have made peace with it all and just want to go out there and get started with practice
877745 if there is anyone we dont have to worry about being mature enough to handle the adversity and coming back it is derek he is one of our leaders one of our stars and frankly the only thing that has changed about his role is that it is this year instead of last
877746 ive been doing and running conditioning drills and whatever all summer i can cut i can jump i can do whatever
877747 fortunately i had time this morning since i hadnt planned to volunteer in jacobs classroom today theyre working on art projects today so sarahs mom is assisting
877748 i see one empty table why dont i grab it while you order
877749 still not going so well i just dont know enough about whats popular now i try to keep up with it but there are so many different kinds of groups
877750 it seems like just when i figure out whats hip its not those young kids i work with are totally clued in so they swoop down on customers when they come in and i dont have a chance they send me the customers who come in to shop for oldies from the 80s and 90s of course most of those people dont shop in the mall ill never make my quota this quarter either so im pretty sure theyre going to fire me
877751 i take it things are going so well with craig either
877752 as of this morning about two hours ago to be exact there is no more craig
877753 when i got up this morning he was packing he said he just cant handle it any longer and hes moving out he took most of his clothes and personal items he plans to come by this weekend and pick up his furniture
877754 it is hes going to talk to the landlord about transferring it into my name of course theyre not going to agree to that when they see my credit history even if they do if i get fired i wont be able to afford the rent
877755 its been about oh four or five months i guess
877756 no i havent seen her for a couple of weeks i didnt feel up to it
877757 im pretty sure that a couple on my upper right thigh are infected because the seams of my pants rub on them
877758 i thought i could do it this time i really did things were going so well with craig i agreed to move in with him because i thought he was the one
877759 im going to call suzanne and arrange for her to pick the kids up from school today then were going to the doctor you have your group health insurance coverage through the store right
877760 good then well get those cuts taken care of and talk to the doctor about getting you into the inpatient program
877761 thats why you called me well also ask the doctor to send the necessary paperwork to the store so that you can begin a medical leave of absence now what about your mother do you want me to call her
877762 no not yet shell come rushing over and want to go with us to see the doctor i cant deal with that
877763 all right well deal with mom later lets get going then
877764 you knew what i was going to say before you got here today didnt you you always do
877765 i hoped things would work out with craig im really sorry that they didnt but hes obviously not the one if he were he would have called me before things got so out of control again and hed be here with us now instead of wherever he is so screw him you dont need him good riddance come on now weve got things to do
877766 how many more times im so tired of doing this how many more times are we going to do this
877767 this is the last time i believe that if you believe that really reach down into your soul and believe that it can be now come on youve got some serious work ahead of you
877768 im your friend this is just what friends do im glad you called me lets get going
877769 there is going to be a vote september 30 will not come and go without a vote on the opening the outer continental shelf the message has been delivered the issue cant be ignored any longer
877770 bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full fair debate consisting of full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives
877771 when this country needs oil it is forced to listen to
877772 great my classes are hard but i love my professors and im learning a lot
877773 3 hung on the wall next to the door underneath which was a cheerful sign
877774 meeting wrapped up early and i decided not to go back to the office
877775 the poor kid looks like a clone of me thats for sure
877776 but its totally different her life is totally different youre making sure of that
877777 youre not your mother you could never be like your mother
877778 did something happen at school something dredge up the memories
877779 i think its just that shes growing so fast and shes almost the age i was when
877780 i look at her sometimes and i cant understand how anyone could
877781 i hear my own voice in my head i remember screaming no mama not again and i just cant imagine those words coming out of her mouth the thought of somebody doing that to her
877782 you are not your mother you could never do the things to your daughter that your mother did to you and thats what counts right
877783 i was planning to make pork chops for dinner how does that sound
877784 oh my goodness did you grow while i was at work today
877785 you drew a beautiful picture id like you to tell us all about it will you
877786 her voice faded as she walked down the hallway between her parents animatedly pointing to the drawing as she held it up proudly with the other hand to interpret her work while they listened raptly
877787 miss mimi would like you all to start cleaning up now its time to go outside and play
877788 i never ever thought i would find myself standing here addressing you on an occasion like this it simply never entered my mind but when officer vasquez came to my house to invite me i immediately accepted the invitation
877789 because i dont want any other parent to experience what i have i wouldnt wish what has happened to my family on anyone else and if i can spare
877790 his voice cracked and broke off he took a couple more deep breaths just as the psychologist with whom he had met earlier that morning had instructed the auditorium was eerily silent as the normally rambunctious audience patiently waited for him to continue speaking
877791 when i was approached about speaking to you this morning i knew that it would be difficult
877792 i tried to prepare myself but i have to admit that i wasnt prepared to see the car again when officer vasquez and i met the first time he asked for my permission to display the vehicle in the courtyard here on campus so that all of you could see it close up and appreciate the extent of the damage
877793 i want you to imagine what your parents would feel like if they had to look at a vehicle in similar condition knowing thats where you took your last breath
877794 most of you here knew my twins christopher and crystal they were 17 years old when they both died this past december in that s u v out there in the courtyard the car was broadsided by another s u v driven by a 21 year old young man who was drunk they were on their way home from a christmas party and proceeded into the intersection because the light was green but the other driver didnt even slow down when he entered that intersection he was so drunk that he never noticed the light in his direction was red his blood alcohol level was 24 three times the legal limit my kids never had a chance
877795 they both died at the accident scene inside that vehicle the firefighters had to use the jaws of life to free them from the wreckage but by the time they cut through the roof and pulled their bodies out of the s u v it was too late they were both already dead
877796 so when i look at that car i look at the place where my two children my only children literally took their last breaths
877797 there are a number of victims in this story they include another young man who used very poor judgment and will pay for his short sightedness for the rest of his life his life for all intents and purposes also ended the night my childrens lives ended because now he sits in a four by nine foot cell in a maximum security prison and wishes that he had made a different choice he wishes that he had chosen not to drive that night
877798 you do not want to be like that young man and you do not want to put your parents through the hell that his parents are now living out
877799 the emotions that i experience every day are feelings that no parent should ever have to feel
877800 when my twins were little they loved to play hide and seek they thought it was so much fun to hide from me they would both jump up into my lap and beg me to play with them daddy daddy we want to hide from you theyd say sometimes i was tired because i had worked all day but they didnt understand that of course they just wanted me to play with them so no matter how tired i was i would go into the hallway and cover my eyes like this
877801 then they would hide and it was my job to find them of course since there were two of them they conspired
877802 and i of course always let them think that i didnt know where they were hiding i always let them win
877803 since the night they both died i have a recurring nightmare in which were playing hide and seek just like we used to im in the hallway and i have my hands over my eyes i hear them whispering just like they used to and then scamper away into one of the other rooms in our house except in my nightmare unlike when they were little kids playing the game with me i dont know where they are i cant hear them and even though i look and look i can never find them i wake up in a cold sweat with my hands over my face like this
877804 that concludes our presentation but before you go i want you to understand how strongly those of us involved with every 15 minutes program feel about it the program has received some negative press recently some folks have said that the presentation is too intense too emotional weve been accused of taking the dramatic approach too far especially by using the grim reaper character staging a traffic collision and simulating the deaths of some of your classmates in order to illustrate the point that drinking and driving are a deadly combination
877805 i know how difficult it was for you to come here today and speak to these kids
877806 i appreciate it greatly as does every other person associated with the program
877807 dont call me again im going to vote republican but i cant let anybody know its got to stay a secret
877808 im conservative too but dont let anyone know i also have two friends here ill point them out to you theyre also secret conservatives
877809 when this country needs oil it is forced to listen to
877810 no im not leaving ill be back in a few moments
877811 yes i think we should catch up i think that would be lovely in fact i was hoping you would be here because i have some questions for you and i would really like to catch up by getting a few answers after all its been a few years hasnt it
877812 i would love to hear what you have been up to
877813 since you left my apartment so abruptly that new years day
877814 he began haltingly his eyes darting to the doorway behind her in which several of their classmates had paused to chat after recognizing each other
877815 do you have any idea how much i loved you any clue at all about how much you meant to me
877816 you never had any idea even after that new years eve of the impact you had on me on my life did you
877817 he said fumbling for a way to extricate himself from the conversation
877818 you think you can just waltz in here and yammer on casually about how we should catch up after what you did to me to us is that what you think maybe its time you heard about your
877819 i was just on my way to the ladies room
877820 its great to see you tell you what ill go over to the bar get us a couple of drinks and meet you back here then we can catch up
877821 i saw you there when i arrived for my first appointment this morning that was more than two hours ago
877822 well why dont you tell me a little bit about yourself and what brings you in today
877823 well i just wanted someone to talk to about things i found your name in the yellow pages and since your office is not far from my house i decided to come meet you and give this a try
877824 what kinds of things would you like to talk about
877825 there have been a lot of changes in my life lately
877826 i just want to figure out where im going from here
877827 i was living with her so now im living alone in her house she left it to me
877828 im sorry for your loss how long ago did she pass
877829 six months ago i moved back in with her so that i could take care of her my brother is married and has a couple of kids he and his wife both work so since i am single i decided that i should be the one to move in and see her through to the end
877830 she had cancer colon cancer we thought she was cured it had been more than ten years but one day she found a lump in her neck so she went to the doctor turned out the cancer had come back and spread to her bones they tried chemotherapy again but it didnt work
877831 how long was she ill after the recurrence that is
877832 from the time she was diagnosed until she died i stayed with her the whole time i didnt want her to die in a hospital or hospice i quit my job i hated it anyway and moved into her house i didnt know that she planned to leave the house to me but she did so now i need to figure out if i want to stay there or sell it and move somewhere else
877833 but i got divorced about three years ago i dont have any kids can i smoke in here
877834 no im sorry but i do not allow patients to smoke in my office
877835 im curious why did you arrive so early today and spend a couple of hours standing across the street from my office
877836 well i got off work and didnt feel like going home first i work nights in the emergency room at the hospital down the street
877837 and i got off work a little after 7 00 a
877838 i had to satisfy my curiosity i wanted to see what kind of people were coming in and out of here see if i could catch a glimpse of you you know check things out a bit before deciding
877839 so are we going to do some work together here in this office did i pass inspection are you ready to get real and tell me whats going on in your life that led you to make this appointment with me i just want to know if were done doing this little dance and ready to rock and roll im not everybodys cup of tea and thats cool if you dont think we can work together you can go i wont even bill you well just consider this little look see a freebie not the right fit have a nice life its up to you
877840 scotland originally but ive been a citizen of this country for nearly twenty years now
877841 youll find that my accent becomes much more pronounced after ive been home for a visit but after a few weeks it fades away again and that is the last personal question i will answer it is not appropriate within the context of the psychotherapist patient relationship for me to discuss details about my life with you
877842 so what do you think wanna stick around and talk for awhile
877843 can i move into that other chair this is the most uncomfortable contraption i have ever tried to sit it heres some advice you should get rid of it its horrid i dont know how anybody could talk about anything important while sitting in that thing
877844 if youre ready to get started tell me more about what brings you here today
877845 im right here beside you you look beautiful all of our family and friends are here
877846 he let his voice trail off afraid that reminding her of all the people gathered on the lawn just a few yards outside the vestibule in which they were standing might set her off
877847 look at the sky and the water its a perfect day just for us
877848 i love you you know that we dont need to do this though
877849 we could go upstairs and change and then come back down and just have a big party
877850 i need you to tell me why were doing this
877851 i swore i would never do this and now here i am in this ridiculous dress holding these silly flowers and all those people out there are going to watch me make a complete fool of myself i cant believe i let you talk me into this what was i thinking
877852 they breathed in tandom for a few seconds drawing the fresh but salty sea air deep into their lungs and holding it momentarily before exhaling
877853 well be ready to start in just a couple of minutes
877854 no im not ready i dont want to do this gary can you go tell everyone that theres going to be a delay were going to go back up to our room and change
877855 no problem bro ill check back in five or so
877856 i just cant do this i cant believe i let things get this far im sorry im sorry
877857 its just nerves weve been over this a thousand times youre just reacting to seeing everyone gathered out on the lawn that makes me nervous too but youre going to be just fine as soon as we get out there and start the ceremony
877858 youll see im right here and im going to stay right beside you im not letting you go
877859 i swear to you i wont let go even for a second not even when i put the ring on your finger i will be holding your hand the whole time
877860 what if this ruins everything were so good together just as we are
877861 thats never going to change things are only going to get better you trust me right
877862 i will never understand why you want this so badly
877863 most men get dragged down the aisle kicking and screaming making ball and chain jokes not me i had to fall in love with the one woman in america who makes me drag her down the aisle what were the odds
877864 i told you on our first date that i was never getting married its an archaic ridiculous ritual and i cant believe i ever let you talk me into this
877865 you reminded gary that he is not to say that nonsense at the end of the ceremony right if he calls us mr and mrs i swear ill slug him
877866 gary knows exactly what to say mrs will not cross his lips
877867 i sure did i printed it out and handed it to him just a little while ago he put it in his pocket just in case i need a cheat sheet but i wont i know exactly what im going to say to you
877868 im going to tell you how much i love you and how happy you make me right there in front of everyone and i might just kiss you before gary gives us the go ahead because you look so beautiful today that i might not be able to control myself have i told you how beautiful you look
877869 im sure im going to need to hear that a lot in the coming months as i expand
877870 were going to be a family baby a real family just like weve wanted to be
877871 if youre ready follow me the sooner we start the ceremony the sooner we can start the reception and im planning on drinking her share of the champagne since she cant drink it
877872 so how does it really feel to be a published author
877873 i want to know all the details about how it feels to know that your novel is going to be on the shelves of all your favorite bookstores all over the country no less in just a few weeks
877874 they said it should be a few weeks but their lawyers are pouring over every word checking all of my research so it depends on how long that process takes to complete
877875 why do they have to be involved in publishing a novel anyway
877876 its a business after all and theyre not going to take any chances they want to make sure they will recoup their investment in me
877877 their investment investment it doesnt sound like artistry or creativity have anything to do with it
877878 well from their legal and accounting departments perspective they dont
877879 they can take their time as far as im concerned while the bean counters fuss over the details im spending the advance check
877880 this is the one thing that bothers me about all of this so i want you to give me a straight answer o k
877881 whats with the pen name why arent you going to publish the book under your own name
877882 a lot of authors publish their work under a pseudonym you know mark twain wasnt his real name right
877883 im serious why are you publishing this book under an assumed name why arent you using your real name
877884 youve known me my whole life and youve read the book even though its supposed to be fiction did you happen to notice any parallels
877885 did you happen to see any resemblance of some of the characters in the story to a few real people that you know
877886 think about what would happen if the book were published under my real name you dont think those people at least the ones that are still alive wouldnt notice the similarities people would accuse me of writing an autobiography rather than a work of fiction
877887 look at it this way whats the worst thing that could happen if you used your real name
877888 oh lets see the sorry details of my personal life would be revealed to the world several people would have their feelings hurt because of the way their fictional counterparts are portrayed in the book which means that those people plus a lot more would most likely never speak to me again
877889 plus there are a few security issues that could arise if you stop and think about it
877890 but wouldnt it be better safer for you to just use your name and avoid all the speculation about the authors identity you know thats going to be a big issue right
877891 yup my publisher and i have talked all of that out
877892 in the first place nobody is going to speculate about who wrote the book if the book doesnt sell in the second place once the speculating begins assuming it does the curiosity could help sell the book remember primary colors people were practically wetting themselves trying to figure out who anonymous was
877893 remember that blog we used to read anonymous lawyer that was some of the most clever funniest writing ive ever read but it wasnt funny after we found out who the author really was
877894 i have a deal with the owner of the house if things work out hes going to sell it to me and im going to live here
877895 im on a leave of absence from work right now
877896 im using accrued leave credits to attend to a personal matter so i used part of the advance money to lease the house if the deal with the publisher works out the way i hope it will i will quit my job buy the house and stay here ill be a writer living on the shore of a lake
877897 my dream come true give or take a couple of details
877898 that i retired moved here and they are welcome to come for a visit
877899 o k look i just have to ask one more question
877900 my friend you know that you can ask me anything
877901 im not going to use my real name dana theres nothing more to talk about
877902 think about this what if your book is really successful or better yet what if oprah picks it as her book club selection you know that every book she picks becomes an instant bestseller if you publish it under another name you wont be able to be on her show you wont be able to do one of those online things where she interviews the author and the audience asks questions seriously do you want to miss out on appearing on oprah
877903 oprah dana get real oprah thats your issue with my using a pseudonym first of all oprah would never choose my book in the old days maybe but lately shes either got her audience reading faulkner or new age psycho babble more importantly i dont plan to measure my success by whether oprah and her followers approve of my writing
877904 come on you goofball im hungry lets make some lunch and ill show you the outline so far at least of my new book
877905 the located assemblys manifest definitiondoes not match with the assembly reference
877906 if the codebase is set but the name is not however then its the same as calling assembly loadfrom on that codebase
877907 this is most likely due to for more information refer to http
877908 unmanagedfile dll managedassembly version 1 0 0 0 culture neutral publickeytoken b77a5c561934e089

877910 making me walk around with a pink and silver phone
877911 one or more exceptions have been thrown while loading the types
877912 unable to load one or more of the types in the assembly
877913 if you were president what gt would be the first thing you would do
877914 you dont have to wait until youre president to gt do that you can come over to my house and clean up all the gt dog poop in my back yard and i will pay you 5 dollars then gt we can go over to the grocery store where the homeless guy gt hangs out and you can give him the 5 dollars to use for a gt new house
877915 why doesnt the homeless guy come over and clean up the dog
877916 i dont know if i would use the phrase higher
877917 we will be going into these games doing things different in terms of pre games preparation from those we have in the past
877918 we started earlier with a number of new olympic preparation programs that really are built on our learning from turin and our learning from otp
877919 there have been individuals throughout history alex baumann is a great example victor davis is a great example greg joy is a great example lots of people have been that outspoken about wanting to win in the past
877920 i think the biggest problem if there is a problem with speaking out like that is that canadians think its a strong stance
877921 often people say yeah i want to win a medal because they think its bad to say i want to win theres nothing wrong with that thats what competition is all about
877922 we will get the medals that we get and people will prepare with the resources that we have
877923 we can say i only believe in gold im here for gold none of that matters if you prepared properly and you execute properly and your potential is to win you will win it wont depend on whether you said you were going to do your best or promised gold
877924 weve had unfortunately a lot of injuries in the last two years
877925 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
877926 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
877927 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
877928 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
877929 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
877930 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

877942 to anyone who really understands the water industry and the legacy that we inherited finding the gap was not surprising this exercise showed more competence by niw rather than less where it went wrong was that we did not communicate quickly enough
877943 there is no basis in economic theory or supporting evidence for the governments belief that by deflating demand they will bring inflation permanently under control and thereby induce an automatic recovery in output and employment
877944 the time has come to reject monetarist policies and consider urgently which alternative offers the best hope of sustained recovery
877945 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
877946 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
877947 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
877948 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
877949 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
877950 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
877951 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

877985 we are pleased that we have taken the yellowcake from a volatile region into a stable area to produce clean electricity
877986 valerie plame engaged in a clear case of nepotism and convinced the cia to send her husband on a fact finding mission in february 2002 seeking to determine if saddam hussein attempted to buy yellowcake from niger
877987 during his trip to niger wilson actually interviewed the former prime minister of niger ibrahim assane mayaki mayaki told wilson that in june of 1999 an iraqi delegation expressed interest in expanding commercial relations for the purposes of purchasing yellowcake
877988 wilson chose to overlook mayakis remarks and reported to the cia that there was no evidence of hussein wanting to purchase yellowcake from niger
877989 however with british intelligence insisting the claim was true president bush used that same claim in his state of the union address in january of 2003
877990 outraged by bushs insistence that the claim was true wilson wrote an op ed in the new york times in the summer of 2003 slamming bush
877991 wilson did this in spite of the fact that mayaki said saddam did try to buy the yellowcake from niger the senate select committee on intelligence disagreed with wilson and supported mayakis claim this meant nothing to wilson who was opposed to the iraq war and thus had ulterior motives in covering up the prime ministers statements

877994 environmental extremists and the politicians who do their bidding are strangling consumers minorities and the working poor by restricting our ability to produce enough american energy and forcing energy prices to go through the roof
877995 it is a sad but undeniable fact that higher energy prices hurt the poor more than any other sector of our society median income families devote about a nickel on every dollar of income to energy costs while poor families must devote as much as 50 cents on their dollar studies show that high energy prices are one of the single biggest drivers of homelessness and high energy prices are literally forcing millions of americans to make horrible choices between food fuel and medicine

878170 elan will feel the full brunt of the lost tysabri sales as the company lacks a substitutable drug
878171 we believe the risk benefit profile of the drug remains favorable

878177 in a sense there are only five computers clouds on earth

878197 however there is no doubt that mangaung will complete the stadium ahead of the fifa deadline of december 2008
878198 we have on site 400 people and of those people about 85 percent are local the other 15 percent comes from outside because they offer specialised services which were not available at the time when the contract was awarded

878203 from our walk about this morning you could see the greatest challenge facing the free state is unemployment and poverty
878204 it stares you in the face the poverty and unemployment we need to ask ourselves what we are doing as the province and the district to deal with this issue

878209 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
878210 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief

878219 i know where i want it to start i dont mean to make it sound very grand its very simple just where i want it to be when it takes off so russells arranged for that
878220 there are a bunch of things ive always wanted to see in doctor who yes but now its slightly very different in my new position
878221 obviously i only turned up once a year and practically my brief was to write in effect the moffat episode the one thats very different the one thats a bit timey wimey or a bit scary and thats all they were expecting and they would just tell me go and do your thing so i would do my moffat y thing whatever the f k that is in a very very pronounced way but you couldnt have a whole series like that if you started a series with silence of the library or blink people would turn off you cant have that as the first episode its just too grim so its different contemplating it from this position very very different
878222 son being a man is about leading and taking responsibility for a family and a community
878223 its detrimental to boys because a father kind of gives you some sort of preview of where youre going

878225 i heard milk does a body good but damn girl how much milk have you been drinking
878226 and for the honor of themselves their families and their country they agreed
878227 on this occasion it seems that public outrage has succeeded where the iocs quiet diplomacy failed its time for the olympic movement and world leaders to speak up about human rights in china
878228 this partial lifting of censorship shows the chinese government is not completely insensitive to pressure if the entire world had been pressuring china since 2001 even before these games were assigned to beijing the situation might have been different today and perhaps imprisoned journalists would have been freed before the opening ceremony
878229 yet here i am knee deep in a river of pussy

878236 eu estava no nibus e um rapaz sentado ao lado de uma senhora ficou me observando ele disse que nada estava acontecendo e arrancou o cord o da senhora foi quando outros rapazes apareceram pegando os pertences dos demais passageiros eu pensei deus se forsua vontade eu serei assaltado e os rapazes continuaram com o roubo e eu mais uma vez pensei deus se for sua vontade eu serei assaltado um dos rapazes mostrou uma arma e eu pensei deus se for sua vontade eu serei assaltado um dos rapazes ficou em encarando e eu baixei a cabe a e pensei deus se for sua vontade eu serei assaltado no fim os rapazes desceram do nibus e n o me assaltaram

878246 i know what we need to do about your premonitions i know where we need to go
878247 handles the gasoline sale the other checks the oil radiator and air before cleaning the windshield the true service station is born
878248 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
878249 we understand as the d lai l ma does that t1b t is part of china but we hope t1b tans are not repressed or oppressed
878250 you dont want to go over there and insult the chinese
878251 it would not be good for our relations i certainly dont think the president would or should go over there and be confrontational at the same time i think the president can in a very diplomatic style make it clear what we stand for and believe in
878252 we hope the media could respect relevant laws and regulations of china
878253 if a few websites are difficult to browse its mainly because they have spread content that is banned by the chinese laws
878254 the internet is regulated according to law in china just like in other countries

878259 i will rain down bread from heaven for you the people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day
878260 you pushed me deceived me induced me or tricked me depending on your translation
878261 well the son of man is a figure from the book of daniel
878262 by allowing beijing to host the games you will help in the development of human rights
878263 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
878264 we dont care what the government of the host country does
878265 well do our utmost to ensure that host governments have good human rights records
878266 we have obtained the new foreign media law it is not perfect we agree we are pressing the chinese to implement it as best as possible this is a revolution this is something that i believe will also leave a lasting legacy in china
878267 i believe the games will definitely bring something to china and definitely an openness to the country which is unprecedented
878268 in one or two years after the games you can see what influence they had i think the chinese will know much more about the world than they know today and the world much more about china i believe that will be a positive effect
878269 the chinese government has seized control of all chinese owned tent factories and existing stock
878270 on factory floors for at least a month maybe more
878271 move may have some effect on us suppliers gearing up for the outdoor season and could bottleneck production into the spring of 2009
878272 just when you think youve lost everything you find out you can always lo o o o ose a little more
878273 trying to get to heaven before they close the door
878274 the introduction of such restrictions without warning creates serious problems for companies operating in china
878275 we support these efforts because of the valuable mutually beneficial partnership the government run union offers and because of their commitment to assisting businesses in our growth and development in china
878276 is this an admission by wal mart that it wasnt paying enough i dont know
878277 trade unions of the foreign invested enterprises in china have firmly centered on production and business operation to conduct activities and have given support to enterprises in their operation and management according to law have educated workers to observe factory rules and regulations and discipline organized workers to launch labor emulation campaigns and aroused the enthusiasm of the workers for running the enterprises well so as to contribute to the sound development of the enterprises
878278 and with two very minor variations it conveys my thinking exactly
878279 china is being criticized because china needs to satisfy its customer the west
878280 power means everything as long as i am powerful enough i can just diss you
878281 i am telling you not that i dont want to change i do but i dont want to be changed by you or be changed on your terms not that i dont want democracy i do but i want to do it my own ways and with my own timetable
878282 you dont know whats the best for you you dont know what you are missing
878283 the government has announced the abolition of both the household registration system which blocked job seeking peasants from enjoying full resident status in cities and the custody and repatriation procedure under which the police randomly swept up and abused peasants and others who were living in cities illegally it ended the grain tax which contributed to the widening income gap between the countryside and urban areas it is trying to shift more of the impetus for economic growth from export sectors to domestic consumer demand partly by shifting more income to farmers and partly by improving the social safety net in addition wen recently announced plans to provide free education nationwide through the ninth grade improve health care in rural areas and strengthen the protection of rural residents property rights
878284 an array of actors nongovenmental organizations pressing for official action on issues such as hiv aids and the environment legal aid offices helping migrant workers sue companies and the government pensioners and laid off workers petitioning for back wages and pensions journalists embarrassing local officials with investigations of mining accidents and land grabs pose challenges for various levels of the party and the government it is an open question however whether these forces threaten the regime or strengthen it the interests of the central authorities are not always aligned with those of corrupt or incompetent local or even high level officials social contention may be frightening when it boils up from beneath the surface after having been repressed for a long time but it may still serve the survival interests of the regime if it is managed well
878285 the fact that institutions owned by the state and the ccp are such a rich source of information on the regimes pathologies is revealing because although chinese media and research institutes operate with increasing autonomy the party still guides their work when its guidelines are disregarded or flaunted reporters and scholars are fired sometimes jailed and their publications or institutes risk being closed it is doubtful that so many reporters and academics are evading such strictures that the regime can no longer censor them fast enough more likely the authorities use this stream of reporting and research to collect information on emerging problems warn party cadres to improve their performance and show the public that the party is acting on its concerns it remains to be seen whether the strategy will succeed but at least the regime is addressing the problems pei sees because it sees them itself
878286 if china aspires to be a great power wheres its mission statement
878287 pomfret wanders a bit into strange territory when he argues china cannot become a superpower simply because gdp per capita is so low but why does low per capita gdp preclude development of a strong country if gdp is high enough china can finance a modern military and its state owned businesses can purchase overseas energy and mineral resources with even modest gdp growth the domestic market can serve a middle class of perhaps 400 million or 100 million depending on the estimate which is larger than almost all western countries populations if china is a giant in terms of worldwide trade it can have greater influence in trade contracts with countries like brazil and the central asian nations marginalizing the united states
878288 when it comes to high tech exports such as computers and electronic goods 89 percent of chinas exports come from non chinese owned companies china is part of the global system but its still the low cost assembly and manufacturing part and foreign not chinese firms are reaping the lions share of the profits
878289 trying to shift more of the impetus for economic growth from export sectors to domestic consumer demand partly by shifting more income to farmers and partly by improving the social safety net
878290 the government has announced the abolition of both the household registration system which blocked job seeking peasants from enjoying full resident status in cities
878291 not all of china s dreams are going to be achieved because hard wired into their dna are serious constraints that will keep china from becoming what it aspires to
878292 a big economy with questionable domestic politics or human rights at best
878293 what matters is that china continues to develop economically and socially so that per capita living standards can continue to improve
878294 blockbusters dont grow out of the barrel of a gun neither do superpowers in the age of globalization
878295 and pomfret is a knowledgeable writer on china who speaks fluent chinese unlike maj and has been traveling to china for almost 30 years it takes some nerve to accuse pomfret of ignoring chinas progress
878296 for centuries chinese debated what it was to be a good person a good citizen but fifty plus years of communist censorship and political campaigns have silenced those debates and it is still unclear whether the country has the ability to revive the tradition of asking these timeless questions
878297 t he best judge of a person s gender is what lies within her or his heart

878319 and theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
878320 the trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt
878321 we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases while citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history

878350 one of the prime qualities a leading movie star must have is f ability do you honestly think that its talent alone that puts them into leading category as opposed to character actor falling in love with the hero or heroine of the movie is often what its all about if that doesnt happen for you then the movie wont work for you
878351 to make it in this industry you gotta have f ability
878352 this fight was about business the business between the two

878355 this is an argument about the business you might think about the computer and danielles reaction to that

878367 we did apologise and were genuinely sorry if we upset anyone but we never put anyones life in danger or did any of the things that have been reported were just two girls who went away for a week and had a few drinks on a plane
878368 that group included two of my cousins and we bumped into them
878369 but we went out with them once in fact we only went out twice the whole week people were calling us boring
878370 lynette was playing music on her mobile for about two minutes and the woman next to her asked her to turn it off which she did
878371 wed bought a bottle of vodka and were just having a drink and chatting
878372 lynette sprayed some perfume and the woman said it was giving her kids a headache then a steward came and asked for the vodka wed paid for it and he was obnoxious so we said no
878373 later another steward came and asked us nicely for it so we handed it over but the next thing we know someone is saying weve been diverted to frankfurt and we were going to be chucked off
878374 i got up to find out what was going on because i knew my kids would be at the airport waiting for me with my boyfriend and i was worried but they wouldnt listen
878375 but i never went near a door i wouldnt put my own life at risk let alone anyone elses
878376 we landed in germany were breathalysed and interviewed and freed within two hours we cant have been that much of a threat
878377 weve been made out to be this pair of slappers who went away for a boozy week and caused a load of trouble but thats just not us ive got to go in work and im dreading it
878378 i asked if theyd lost any keys and i was told that none were missing i asked to speak to a supervisor but they said she wasnt in
878379 their attitude just amazed me because there were so many keys on the bunch that anyone who found them could have opened all the post boxes in tyldesley
878380 its just lucky that these keys didnt get into the wrong hands people send important documents in the post and they could easily have been stolen had someone else got their hands on those keys
878381 leaving those keys in the door is a breach of peoples security
878382 i turned the keys and the door on the post box just opened i knew i couldnt leave them there so i locked up the door and took them back home to my mum i dont think its safe to leave keys in doors like that

878445 i had just got home and was in the kitchen when i heard a bang i saw all different people flying out of their doors
878446 i came out of my house and went into autopilot i checked her pulse and we put a dressing gown over her and a towel on her head where i could see she had cut herself
878447 i was talking to her telling her she would be alright although i did not know if she could hear me it was terrible so awful and so so sad
878448 the lady in the car was in shock but she could not have done anything the little girl just walked out into her car the girl was catapulted back and flew about a metre or so
878449 it was a hell of a bang and a man was shouting
878450 the girl had gotten off a bus before crossing the road
878451 she was then in collision with a car which was travelling along byron road in the direction of macaulay road we are treating this as a serious collision and are investigating the scene as best we can while we have the opportunities
878452 our main retailers like next and monsoon are all moving to the new premises and there is no interest in their old shops
878453 i fear they are simply going to be boarded up it is going to be a disaster for the town centre
878454 there are ups and downs in retail life and everyone is having a bit of down turn now
878455 but we have no real concerns we will be beautifully placed when the up turn comes because the arc has some fantastic facilities
878456 we do not believe that bury st edmunds is suffering any more than the towns and cities around us indeed we are shielded to a certain extent by the added tourism to the town suffolk homes
878457 access to the proposed store will be across wet grassland which according to suffolk wildlife trust is of ecological significance
878458 the proposed store will be located immediately within the river brett corridor and adjacent to a nature reserve on broom hill the area hosts a wide range of flora and fauna
878459 not only is the riverside walk much appreciated by local residents and many visitors for its wild flowers birds and tranquil atmosphere it is of considerable local conservation value
878460 there are some 50 species of birds including many of conservation interest to be found there including turtle doves song thrush nightingale kingfisher water rail spotted flycatcher and barn and tawny owls to name but a few
878461 other important species which are present along the riverside and in adjacent fields and meadows include water voles otters bats toads slow worm and grass snake
878462 a tesco store on the riverside in our lovely town centre poses an unacceptable threat to some of our most precious wildlife resources and to our peace and tranquillity
878463 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
878464 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
878465 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
878466 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
878467 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
878468 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
878469 if you really look at psu banks they corrected substantially in this first 7 month and clearly in the last two months the correction in psu banks were acute because the ten year bond yields substantially perked up that had an impact on the bond portfolio and hence the losses which got factored in the q1 if you really look at any improvement on the ten year bond yield will only improve the chances that the mark to market mtm bond losses will not grow in this quarter again further if thats the case then clearly psu banks come back again very strongly on the fact that the q2 should be far better than the q1 and of course a lot of these psu banks are quoting either close to book or below book in some cases so clearly they have chances of participating substantially in a relief rally of the markets the way they are if you really look at this is clearly a relief rally and if you are saying that its a relief rally where does the relief really exist so clearly capital goods have gone down substantially looking at banks which have gone down substantially so clearly i believe that these are the two segments which are going to clearly participate very strongly in this rally
878470 so capital goods again if you really look at capital goods and construction i would still stay away from construction from the margin decline point of view and clearly it has been uncertainty in terms of margin pressures and the way the business will pan out capital goods has been a far better story as compared to construction it could be a case that money will actually start moving away from construction into capital goods companies and clearly they have an advantage of not requiring as much capital to be raised from the capital markets so clearly capital goods per se can actually rally and substantially participate in this rally

878490 this trend results from the measures that the government takes every year namely the timely supply of inputs through the holding of agricultural fairs crop diversification construction and rehabilitation of irrigation schemes mobilizing peasant farmers to increase the areas under cultivation and to increase productivity through the use of animal traction and tractors and improved seeds
878491 the president of sudan is accused of being directly linked to genocide in darfur sudan rejects these accusations there is no genocide there are just some political problems in any case we havent ratified the treaty setting up this court

878493 masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur masalit and zaghawa groups on account of their ethnicity
878494 those who reached the camps for the displaced people were subjected to conditions calculated to bring about their destruction
878495 today the evidence shows that al bashir instead of assisting the people of darfur has mobilised the entire state apparatus including the armed forces the intelligence services the diplomatic and public information bureaucracies and the justice system to subject the 2 450 000 people living in idp internally displaced people camps most of them members of the target group to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction
878496 al bashir is the president he is the commander in chief those are not just formal words he used the whole state apparatus he used the army he enrolled the janjaweed they all report to him they all obey him his control is absolute

878504 nationally were seeing an influenza consultation rate of about 92 per 100 000 population which is higher than at the same time last year esr surveillance report week ending july 25 2 both influenza a brisbane and b florida strains have been identified immunisation with this seasons influenza vaccine will decrease the risk of illness if infected by these strains so we would strongly advise people to get a vaccination as soon as possible to protect themselves from this serious disease
878505 the overall increase in vaccine uptake this season is good but we are concerned that too few people with chronic health conditions may not have been protected by influenza vaccine it is vital that they get the vaccine soon as it takes up to two weeks to develop immunity
878506 its good to see that many elderly people are getting into the habit of annual immunisation however we really need to increase immunisation among people with chronic conditions as they are most at risk from the serious complications of influenza
878507 esrs safety systems conform to international best practice and no failure of these systems has been identified
878508 given the circumstances it is my opinion as an occupational health specialist that on the balance of probabilities dr adu bobie was infected at the laboratory the cause of this infection remains unknown
878509 i regret the failure of the original investigation to reach what now appears a reasonable conclusion and apologise for any distress this may have caused we acknowledge the ordeal that this has been for dr adu bobie and appreciate that she wishes to ensure no other scientists suffer as she has
878510 esr has continued to be patient and cooperative through this process despite repeated questioning of an issue that has already been under extensive investigation i acknowledge the suffering of dr adu bobie as a result of this terrible infection and her incredible reasonableness and fortitude in dealing with her current situation

878516 reliance communications is one of those breakdown type of cases i think it will not go below rs 380 but it really needs to get pass now rs 470 475 to show any sort of strength i think people are much better of trading an mtnl where you have rs 95 support and that looks like it would probably head back upto rs 125 odd otherwise telecoms are quite flat
878517 metal prices worldwide are coming down but the stocks probably have got into fair bit of beating so they are moving sideways again this morning we are seeing that metals are down but i think tata steel is getting good support around rs 575 580 and probably if the market moves up this could move upto rs 720 725 i think sterlite is finding lots of good support around rs 560 to about rs 580 kind of levels out there you could have a relief rally upto rs 700 but metals as a group are not looking so strong
878518 well i take a few things into consideration when making my choice
878519 i usually choose the medium sized ones and look at the stem end to determine when it was harvested if it was cut from the vine and has a long green stem that means it was harvested early so it is not vine ripened if the stem has dried up and fallen off or is loose enough to gently pull away from the melon than its probably ripe i look for the ones that have a clean divot like that one see where the stem used to be then i press on the divot to see if it yields a bit to the pressure which is a good sign oh and when most melons are fragrant theyre ripe

878526 taking my first snap i went to the line took a deep breath and thought to myself just have fun out here tonight
878527 more than his throws what i was pleased with is how he was looking to the right guy when he was backpedaling
878528 he knew the plays knew the routes he should feel very good about his performance
878529 i didnt know how long i was going to play but that first series was a long one
878530 coach said that was enough to get my work in i was happy to get to play with a lot of the more experienced players
878531 we did a lot of good things a lot of things to be pleased about
878532 theres always the mistakes and thats what weve got to work on
878533 for the first game i dont have anything to be disappointed about
878534 i was excited to have a big turnover for a touchdown at the end that shows the guys playing it all the way through
878535 reliance communications will continue to remain weak because this market doesnt have too much tolerance for negative surprises and people who weighted out for the numbers to come back margins to improve and thereafter go on to look at a stock like this to be invested in though there has been some positive on the 3g spectrum allocation bid for cdma code division multiple access players which mentions that players which have the highest number of subscribers in a circle may get a chance to get spectrum for 3g there so thats positive for reliance communications if it pans out but this is still early stages right now in terms of the process so its going to be driven by rcom stock in a medium term
878536 after having such bad numbers will only sway according to how the 3g spectrum proceeds further from here and thats going to be a near term trigger for the stock but fundamentally its difficult to invest in rcom if one looks at three six months out and if bsnl ipo happens then one is looking at too many choices in telecom so i am not sure whether rcom becomes a default choice in telecom at all the second default choice there is bharti airtel and if by any chance bsnl i do not think there is too much room for too many stocks to be invested in various funds so from that point of view also rcom suffers in case if the numbers do not come out in the second quarter

878541 we are facing lot of problems due to the curfew there is no conveyance available for us to go back the government has done no arrangements for us
878542 we had taken nine vehicles full of people and when we were just a few kilometers away from katra some people attacked us and asked us to go away as they were planning protests even though curfew was clamped in the city we came back with great difficulty after saving our lives

878545 basically the torch symbolizes hopes and aspirations of tibetan people this is being organized by all the tibet support groups around the world and then this we want to shift the spotlight at the moment when the whole media attention is at china and we want to take this as a platform to highlight the issue of tibet and to show the reality that is happening behind all these closed doors
878546 today is the seventh day six hundred hunger strikers who are participating in this campaign to represent the six million tibetan people and they are here with five demands and several appeals to the international community we are demanding immediate end to the brutal suppression of tibetans by the chinese government we also demand immediate end of dumping of liquor and other toxic wastes in tibet

878548 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
878549 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
878550 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

878552 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
878553 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
878554 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
878555 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
878556 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
878557 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
878558 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
878559 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
878560 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

878564 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
878565 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
878566 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
878567 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
878568 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
878569 the wickets will be made up of soil brought in from india australia south africa england west indies so that these are similar to the wickets in those countries
878570 so for example if england has to tour india their players can come here and practise on wickets similar to indian wickets before embarking on the tour
878571 it will be the best coaching facility in the world with wickets with special surfaces and the hawkeye also in place
878572 it the stadium will have a lot of latest advances one key thing is the players area which will have everything in terms of player comfort sports science and such
878573 the vip area will also be very comfortable with all amenities and the media centre will be equipped with the latest technology
878574 it should be completed by the end of this year
878575 well we are in discussions with various cricket boards to have events here in 2009 like odi series

878577 oh yeah if you look at our infrastructure in the uae its amazing
878578 you have the wonderful sheikh zayed stadium in abu dhabi than you have the new dubai sports city stadium coming up and of course the sharjah cricket stadium here
878579 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
878580 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
878581 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
878582 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
878583 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
878584 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
878585 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
878586 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
878587 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
878588 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
878589 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
878590 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
878591 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
878592 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
878593 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
878594 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
878595 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
878596 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
878597 what do you suppose that big x across the face of the object that looks remarkably like a train might mean
878598 that guy over there is waiting for the 10 52
878599 well hes going to miss that one too cant he see that no trans are running theyre out of service
878600 its in pictures how could he not be able to read it
878601 maybe there are no trains where he comes from or buses maybe he doesnt understand that he has to go get the bus
878602 maybe but then wherever hes from they must be pretty underdeveloped i mean if hes never seen a train or bus before
878603 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice in practice there is
878604 baseball is ninety percent mental and the other half is physical
878605 if you dont know where you are going you might wind up someplace else
878606 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
878607 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
878608 the man in the mass does not gain a transcending view from these media instead he gets his experience stereotyped and then he gets sunk further by that experience
878609 rather than that internal discussion we call reflection he is accompanied through his life experience with a sort of unconscious echoing monologue he has no projects of his own he fulfills the routines that exist he does not transcend whatever he is at any moment because he does not he cannot transcend his daily milieux he is not truly aware of his own daily experience and of its actual standards he drifts he fulfills habits his behavior a result of a planless mixture of the confused standards and the uncriticized expectations that he has taken over from others whom he no longer really knows or trusts if indeed he ever really did
878610 there is a knowledge of powerlessness without poignancy and a feeling of pseudo power based on mere smugness by its softening of political will this mood enables men to accept public depravity without any private sense of outrage and to give up the central goal of western humanism the presumptuous control by reason of mans fate
878611 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
878612 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
878613 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
878614 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
878615 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
878616 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
878617 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
878618 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
878619 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
878620 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
878621 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
878622 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
878623 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

878627 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
878628 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
878629 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
878630 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
878631 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
878632 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
878633 maybe good brads suggestion of a friendly letter showing positive intent could result in a modeling contract or just go for the money

878637 the reality is that today the mac platform is relatively safe there are hundreds of thousands of viruses and other malicious software programs floating around for windows but less than 200 are known to target the mac and many of those are aimed at versions of the mac os prior to mac os x and thus have no effect on a modern mac its not that mac os x is inherently more secure against viruses than current versions of windows although it was clearly more secure than windows prior to xp sp2 the numerous vulnerabilities reported and patched in recent years are just as exploitable as their windows equivalents but most security experts agree that malicious software these days is driven by financial incentives and its far more profitable to target the most dominant platform
878638 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing

878664 we believe in a jewish majority in jerusalem as such it is the capital of the jewish nation
878665 the israelis tried to take jerusalem out of the political game by using all their power to change the situation and consolidate their rule over the city but they failed
878666 she was born there i dont see why she should change it
878667 just because we came under occupation does not mean they israelis have the right to expel people

878703 because of that sometimes you dont see the frills and showboating you see from other players but you get an end product from wayne
878704 he does the running and work of two players you could say that about carlos tevez as well
878705 maybe wayne needs to be more selfish but sometimes he was playing left or right wing and its difficult for him to make an impact in games
878706 benayoun is happy to play for liverpool and there hasnt been any official approach for the player

878739 how will you care for these chairs will you wash them daily or weekly when you relocate will you take the chairs with you and if so will you bubble wrap them to ensure they sustain limited dame if you get rid of them will you make sure they go to a good home will you send me pictures of the chairs on a monthly basis so i can keep an eye on them
878740 i am going to to post signs on the chairs and request that strange men jerk off on them so theyre dripping in foreign god willing disease laden cum stains ill also make sure that every man i fuck dines at the y while i sit on said cum stained chair if i relocate i will hold a seance and use the chairs as kindle for the massive fire we will sit around while conjuring dead spirits will that suffice sweetie

878781 many years ago as a new editorial assistant at a venerable publishing house i was warned by a senior colleague never to use a certain word when telling authors what would happen to their unsold books the forbidden word was mulched my colleague a compassionate sort worried that the word might shatter the fragile psyches of authors who had toiled for years on their manuscripts it was better to let them believe their work was being discounted or perhaps donated to some inner city literacy program today a tactful publisher might simply invoke environmental concerns and emphasize the global imperative of recycling to prevent the melting of polar ice caps in effect telling authors destroying your book will save coastal cities
878782 years ago i wrote about a formula for success determination goal setting concentration success i received a letter from a harvard graduate saying that i was missing a fourth quality courage his point was that determination could be undermined by the fear that comes with a new venture
878783 let me take that one step further in my opinion many people fail to achieve their goals not because they are afraid of the job at hand but because they have grown so familiar in the comfort zone of their job they are afraid to meet the challenge of a new job i once heard someone joke that the road to success is marked with many tempting parking places

878798 this case underscores the reality that it is not only greed that can inspire disloyal behavior by a business fiduciary in fact when a business fiduciary lives a plush and comfortable life derived from substantial distributions from family trusts he can afford to place other considerations such as the achievement of a personal dream a desire to prove himself a ceo or a stubborn refusal to admit failure ahead of the prudent pursuit of maximum profit having a silk sheeted safety net to fall back upon in this case that is just what happened

878845 as i recall the serb government actually tried breaking up the riot that burned the embassy
878846 between that the narrow margin of victory for serbias pro western government which still had to express hostility to kosovar independence and the roots of serbian aggression going back at least to the 80s when milosevic came to power blaming russia for this may be granting more credit than is due
878847 until its people can define sovereignty by love of the land instead of ethnicity the only lasting peace it will have will be that of the grave
878848 the germans have abandoned pomerania the hungarians have forfeited their claims to transylvania and even the greeks have forgotten smyrna generations are fickle things as each believe it is the wisest in history in spite of the fact that the previous was the most foolish in 20 years what will the serbian young think of their parents and their parents dreams
878849 note that the germans forgot pommerania only after defeats at the hands of the allies in wwi and the russians in wwii
878850 i doubt the serbs will ever be put under such pressure by europe
878851 hell the europeans cant even find a couple battalions to send to af out of their 1 7 million man standing army no way theyre going to fight and die for kosovos independence
878852 tdaxp would you characterize the germans forfeiting of pommerania as ethnic clensing what about sudeten germans
878853 see what a can of worms this kosovo thing is
878854 multiethnic states are inherently unstable while countries can rule any number of lands if your statement is true then the grave is our only lasting peace
878855 in our case the bond is a shared idea of how things should work

878859 its in here pointing to his head its in here pointing to his heart thats the beauty of music they cant get that from you havent you ever felt that way about music
878860 i played a mean harmonica as a younger man lost interest in it though dont make much sense in here
878861 heres where it makes the most sense you need it so you dont forget
878862 forget there are places in the world that arent made out of stone that theres a theres something inside that they cant get to that they cant touch thats yours
878863 it was a performance where we had a lot of good things and a lot of things to be pleased about
878864 we had some mistakes and as i told the team football is still that way the team that doesnt beat themselves has the best chance to win
878865 all in all we had some things to be encouraged about we had some penalties we have to get straightened around and we had some errors but we had a lot of good individual performances
878866 we could have done some things better but we were in the game and they made more plays at the end
878867 a lot of young players stepped up and played well i thought our offense moved the ball and our defense gave us a chance at the end all of those things are really good qualities that you look for in the first game
878868 you want to see how guys are going to react to being in their first game in the nfl i thought overall we showed well the first offense moved the ball well we moved the ball well sorg played well think there are a number of things to build on
878869 aside from the final score i think we had some things to be pleased about
878870 except for a couple of bad plays which you cant have in this game we had a lot of good individual performances
878871 its a learning experience mainly for the young guys to see how they adapt and how they play under pressure the young guys did a great job especially on the defensive front getting to the quarterback
878872 thats our focus we have to get to the quarterback and we did a great job of that
878873 what i wanted lucas i wanted you to want me i wanted you to fight for me lucas

878876 time travels a bi amp aint it fix your damn problem
878877 i have no love for the american left which is as anti capitalist and anti military as they come
878878 given that senator obama has ran on a campaign promising a more consensual kind of politics rather than the cutthroat 50 1 politics of herr rove i cant take seriously rhetoric that paints him as being policy devoid especially when many have already said that obama and hillary have minor differences over policy
878879 further obama did not threaten any allies and is not appeasing iran and syria as doc barnett points out the soft kill is the way to go on this one and i think obama gets that as well
878880 i see his administration continuing to tone down the hostility with iran cut some deals with the mullahs and then watch as the theocracy collapses in on itself cccp style and on pakistan he only threatened to go after the al qaeda elements in the northwest sounds exactly like our recent killing of al libi further obama is no fan of musharraf and neither are the pakistanis so that should work in our favor also
878881 and i might be deliberately provocative here its about fucking time for a minority to be president seriously it sends a message to the world that we can get over our own internal and petty bullshit and that wed like to see others do the same
878882 i look forward to seeing the system do something productive for once
878883 its important to remember that its not racism if you vote for obama because hes black its only racism if you vote against obama because hes black
878884 most of the intellectual community is doing the same thing
878885 of course the new york times hypes charges against mccain hes a republican
878886 and anyone who claims expertise in anything has given up on new learning
878887 however your hypothesis that much of the support for obama is race based and stephens apparent agreement with that statement definitely argues for your explanation as well
878888 dont pack for the worst scenario pack for the best scenario and simply buy yourself out of any jams

879065 jon could have been a millionaire it just wasnt his bag
879066 he really was the most powerful person on the net
879067 he came by that power legitimately as the only person who could command the respect and loyalty of the whole community
879068 if the net does have a god he is probably jon postel
879069 its not appropriate for a single individual like dr postel to make those policy decisions
879070 have to be made fairly and with the long term benefit of the internet community in mind
879071 if we tell them they wont be interested any more
879072 with the climate changing due to higher levels of carbon di oxide in the atmosphere we need to find methods to absorb the carbon that we rapidly generate trees do this by photosynthesis but bamboo does it five times faster than the others
879073 we have estimated that the city emits 16 million tonnes of co2 a year assuming that 10 million tonnes are absorbed by the existing green cover it leaves another 6 million tonnes in the balance this can be effectively neutralised by planting 12 million bamboo trees though it may seem like a big number if each citizen plants a sapling once in his her lifetime we can achieve this goal
879074 members of the organisation will be available to guide individuals on how to plant the trees give information on the soil type area needed and so on
879075 when i came in here i told the guys this is a really good team
879076 i know theyve been frustrated by how the year has gone but you look around this team can win
879077 well worry about winning the game today and then figure out tomorrows game
879078 our bullpen has been real solid the last month or so guys have fallen into rolls they need to be in sampson in particular has been extremely good
879079 well keep doing it in practice and decide whether to use it
879080 the takeoff is the key if you get excited and go too early you dont get the speed its about being patient on the tower and once my arms get moving to get my feet moving
879081 we look at them as the team to beat which is great
879082 that raises our level of performance to be where theyre at and thats good for everybody
879083 i cant get inside their heads so i cant say how theyre feeling
879084 they have a lot of veterans on their team as well as some new dives so im sure they are well prepared
879085 everybody who is here is prepared for the competition its that given day that a certain athlete can prove themselves to be ahead of the game by being prepared and ready for whatever situation comes out
879086 we talked about it with ishimatsu and duchinnay and theyre good with it
879087 they knew it wasnt a personal thing im going to go all out to win in the individual event and i certainly will support haley and mary beth
879088 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
879089 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron james it could be d wade dwyane wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
879090 taking my first snap i went to the line took a deep breath and thought to myself just have fun out here tonight brennan said
879091 and i had a lot of fun so did the huge contingent of washington fans who turned fawcett stadium into a makeshift version of fedex field
879092 more than his throws what i was pleased with is how he was looking to the right guy when he was backpedaling said zorn a former nfl quarterback
879093 he knew the plays knew the routes he should feel very good about his performance
879094 i didnt know how long i was going to play but that first series was a long one sorgi said
879095 coach said that was enough to get my work in i was happy to get to play with a lot of the more experienced players
879096 we did a lot of good things a lot of things to be pleased about dungy said
879097 theres always the mistakes and thats what weve got to work on
879098 for the first game i dont have anything to be disappointed about zorn said
879099 i was excited to have a big turnover for a touchdown at the end that shows the guys playing it all the way through
879100 its kind of a relief after that week i had going around the state
879101 going from here to there i thought i was a presidential candidate for a while because it was so crazy
879102 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
879103 most of the time you know i am a cat theres not a thought in my mind beyond the moment i want to eat or to sleep hunt or mate
879104 it was disturbing enough to feel passion inside another mans body especially considering the differences in our tastes but that first time when i was attacked by this bodys lust its painful drive to sex the moment before my death was not so terrifying
879105 even when you are the cat you are there you the one who is calling himself speaker but who had another name once however long ago it was you and however many others there are in there i still dont understand how there could be so many of you there i thought reincarnation was different somehow not that i understand all that i have heard and read things that dont make much sense tend to just go through my head and i dont usually make much effort to stop anything that doesnt really grab my interest i guess i should have listened more
879106 in a way now you are the magician for them
879107 with a flash you bring them into the light where they can be seen and hear they are all but alive again because of you
879108 they think they feel and now they interact it may be that they are not breathing flesh but even that one the one who was so stricken to learn that she has a soul at all even she is in the true sense animated
879109 without your presence here and now they would be as they were before still wandering formless and without the key to the doorway past that existance
879110 i was in green bay started out with a shoulder injury i got released and was out of football for a year then i went to nfl europe for the first time played sparingly came back and went to minnesota for camp was against the numbers next year i came to houston
879111 coach kubiak told me he liked my work ethic and that he was trying to get me back
879112 hes one of those players you talk about guys that all of a sudden start to become really good pros
879113 you talk about wr kevin walter and we talked about lb zac diles progress you could throw earl in that mix hes a better player hes held up better because his work habits in the offseason have taken a step forward hes got a chance to be a fine player
879114 i was fortunate enough to have earl when i was in green bay with the packers so i know what type of work ethic the guy has
879115 thats what you have to do at this stage you have to make sure you prepare yourself to know all the positions so when the opportunity comes you can do the job
879116 it was big to sit out that whole year and just sit back and watch
879117 i have a passion for the game and have fun when i get out here
879118 when i come out i come out to have fun some days are better than others but you come out if its fun to you you just keep going
879119 a sort of multilingual pun which tells you how self consciously literary it is
879120 they break down and have little bit of jazz now and then usually on sunday afternoons but the room is really too small for anything with any brass to it you would like it there i believe
879121 you are a poet but what do you do for a living i mean i might say that i am a novelist or a songwriter if i wanted to stretch things what i do is no the same im a waitress and when i am working for real money it is all in codes as soon as i can get an internet connection up and running from here i can get some freelance web design work thats me what do you do
879122 a while ago quite a while now i had a breakdown im not ready to go back yet i was finishing my residency there was a lot of pressure over that and over some other things at the same time my personal life was a wreck all at once everything got to be too much for me and i just shut down
879123 when i started seeing the ghosts i thought it was because i was just over the bend
879124 compared to you i suppose i was fortunate that there were only two on the other hand one of mine was asking me to get revenge for her she came to me to this blithering shell of a human being and told me she wanted me to kill someone for her
879125 no i did what any sane person in the middle of a breakdown would do i went on with my breakdown and ignored her along with anyone else who wasnt me myself and i
879126 eventually her name was eleanor she and sonny both started feeling a little sorry for me irritated frustrated that i was all they had to work with but sad for me and the mess that i was making of what ought to have been a perfectly good life she said that in almost so many words
879127 they helped me in the end and then i was able to help them move on too
879128 when that happened she just for a moment got this glow of comprehension i suppose and she smiled then she was just gone
879129 i wrote an anonymous letter to his girlfriend saying that i was a psychic and that he had sent a message to her that it wasnt hidden in the back yard so she could stop digging and ought to open the boxes of books in the attic instead
879130 sonny was an embezzler he never had a chance to enjoy his ill gotten gains i think that if i were going to be a crook id probably do just as bad a job of it i want some instant gratification
879131 were going to put it in demecos ryans helmet and wills demps helmet if both of those guys are on the field demeco is live if something were to happen to demeco then we would operate through will
879132 ill carry three if they deserve to be on the team
879133 hes turned into a pro busts his tail every day good kid good technician should play out there for a long long time hes got a lot of respect around this league and i think the future is very bright for him
879134 i feel like my first year here i was kind of all over the place and then when i got my chance i took the most of it
879135 last year i think i took a big sophomore step in proving myself and solidifying my spot and what i can do there now im really able to come out here and do something special
879136 hes an athletic kid can make plays in the pass game and has been a surprise in the run game
879137 well give him a lot of reps in the preseason and see how he does
879138 he said something all right only i dont believe we heard him i think it was the same way i hear you talking to yourself
879139 i dont talk to myself you get inside my head cat was that you say something else
879140 its from the hebrew it means the hairy one and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man genesis 27 verse 11
879141 they say the devil can quote scripture but i never heard it said about a cat
879142 are you the same cat thats been around all day acting like a regular cat letting me feed you begging wanting your head scratched
879143 i thought i knew all of my past lives but i dont recognize him kind german to testify to my veracity
879144 no there are so many names it seemed best to choose one for us all dont you like it i considered shiva would you prefer that
879145 as much as i want to find out about your talking cat ive got a problem of my own
879146 miss sophie i need to get the saddle back to its owner like i promised it was my word i said id have it ready for him by christmas
879147 it doesnt matter i gave my word and im going to do my best to keep it only only youre going to have to help me
879148 once i find it youre going to have to be my hands
879149 somehow i cant imagine this is going to be simple
879150 you cant do anything for mr satterfield until he finds his what he is looking for
879151 i know youre awake come on get up you cant sleep all day hop up and let the cat out
879152 miss sophie our friend here tells me he is from hawiia
879153 my companion the priest has an interesting sense of humor
879154 we have been discussing matters and decided that among us we have some information that you ought to know
879155 we are not a very good democracy i was chosen to be speaker i guess that will do as a name too it doesnt have the ring of call me esau though does it
879156 i did indeed its right downstairs all weve got to do is open the door and get it out and send it off
879157 that is if you still have the name and if the address is still valid and you have to excuse me if i think this is the bigger if but if we can do it without my winding up in jail for stealing the thing from your sister
879158 aw dont worry about elizabeth if it comes to it you can always tell her about me
879159 yeah like shell believe that please maam dont call the cops im only stealing this saddle because the ghost of your dead brother here told me to what you cant see him why hes standing right behind you making faces at me right now besides that raymond i cant even imagine myself breaking and entering
879160 you wont have to do that the spare key to the side door is right where i left it under the second from the bottom step down there in a magnetic box it didnt take me but one time getting myself locked out and having to wake ben up at three am you can bet money on it being there still
879161 as important as this is to you there are some things sophie needs to know and soon lets go in the other room where its more comfortable
879162 you know how they say ive got some good news and some bad news we have some interesting news and because of our varied pasts we may be of assistance if its any consolation your life should return to normal in a few days
879163 is that the good news that eventually things will stop being bad
879164 ill go on sophie we have been aware of you for days you have been like an movement on the edge of our field of vision never there when we looked always just too far away to find
879165 we thought it was because you had come closer physically that we finally got a fix on you but it was because of the time element instead as it grows closer to the solstice you are becoming more psychically magnetic otto calls it das zusammenstr men der notwendigkeit confluence of need
879166 truth no its a description not an explanation there is power in the open door between the season of night and the season of light and there is power in strong emotion yours are both a beacon illuminating everything around you and a whirlpool sucking up whatever is in your vicinity
879167 our friend raymond here would never have corporealized without your presence he responded to your nearness like one tuning fork vibrating in sympathy to another one already humming
879168 we felt a physical discomfort that could only be relieved by being near you
879169 you know better than that no one here wants to hurt your feelings you ought to be aware that in the next few hours you will probably be having more visitors if i were you i would begin to but my head on straight
879170 it isnt where you are raymonds location was a coincidence that confused us too it is who you are
879171 all right i am the magnet koo koo ka choo whatever i tell you what i am just going to do what i was planning and let whatever is going to happen happen im not going to sit around here waiting i have things to do
879172 you do not move a sofa around by your self innocent the store delivers
879173 this is unbelievable when do you think it was built a little outpost of california in the thirties the house what is it tudor no imagination what is it like up on the roof
879174 i dont know how youd get up there thats funny i just remembered when i was young we lived down the street from a place it had a bar on the street level but there were stairs outside to apartments one of my grandmothers friends lived at the front and her place opened onto a rooftop she was an artist and used to open the french doors and have parties out there it was covered with brown river gravel
879175 ah you little bohemian you want a salon for all your artist friends
879176 this is excellent there is so much room of course i would paint eventually but even if you cant it isnt intolerable one can always ignore white when it isnt too demanding
879177 the bouquet of spilled beer and rented shoes the rumble of the ball the crash the clatter of pins the suspense of that last wobbling loner will it fall or will it stand
879178 well it is long straight and more or less bare wood it would make a wonderful dance studio a barre along the outside wall and mirrors opposite ceiling is too low no elevations what do you see yourself doing here im not being nosy at least not very
879179 the usual of course watching tv reading im a software designer and sometimes i work from home im working on a novel that will never get finished and then there is this
879180 it isnt full size and i just use earphones all its for is playing around with really and a little writing i got it cheap all the paraphernalia cost almost as much as the yamaha
879181 then you need a work station a desk to go alongside the keyboard a chair
879182 you know if you put a folding screen back there you could make almost a bedroom from half of that end of the room then you could use the other half as a studio some sort of divider there behind the couch a bookcase or a table with some plants this place does need some living things in it
879183 i never pay full price for anything period no matter how much you think you need it if you cant haggle for it or find it somewhere cheaper you can always make do with something else it may be better
879184 of course they are its christmas the biggest shoplifting season of the year the stores are full of innocent looking people watching out for crooks theres also hoards of purse snatchers and pickpockets not to mention the fact that we are a striking pair
879185 you might as well get a tool set you will need it sooner or later if you dont
879186 you are definitely a pink your hair and eyes pink and brown go well together
879187 i bought you some supper too if you will just wait a bit
879188 i dont exactly he seems to have adopted me didnt you
879189 im going to go back down and get another load
879190 i noticed i didnt expect that it may be that we should have confluence of need
879191 i dont see raymond did he remember the name of the guy we need to send the saddle to i found the key where he said it would be but i havent tried the lock yet
879192 i wrapped the saddle with a clean sheet first and tied that then its got two layers of plastic shipping wrap around it the label is between the two layers i dont know how they missed it its right out there in plain sight
879193 you too grandaddy cant you see she is busy and tired too those crowds were really something werent they i dont know what moved you to go out to the mall yall were doing just fine at those outlet stores im amy
879194 your friend is on his way back up a quick word of advice tell the truth
879195 that and for my last name russell its either rusty or my initials
879196 sophie dont beat around the bush about this lets just get it over with we have business to take care of you know
879197 hes right though rusty all of these people theyre ghosts look at raymond there look at him closely you can see through to the bathroom door on the other side of him the kitchen table behind amy look and you will see it they are a long way from being as solid as they look and trust me you dont want to touch them
879198 how do you know what the rest of us feel like you have only been around grandaddy here he even looks fuzzy to me
879199 my name when it mattered was sean jacob i was a modestly famous artist before i died in case you are curious it was nothing tragic and exciting i had an aneurysm in my brainstem i had no idea about it went pop one afternoon while i was in my studio working or planning to work thinking it hurt then it was over
879200 well i was just an innocent bystander shot in cold blood
879201 fell down and broke my neck i used to live here
879202 of course theyre ghosts dear anyone can see that i was just wondering what they are all doing here
879203 you might be just a little more i dont know freaked
879204 its not exactly my first time and no i would rather not talk about it in
879205 do you know yet what its going to take to get rid of them i can tell you one thing the church is absolutely worthless when it comes to ghosts not even all that supportive
879206 and about you for that matter what did you do to acquire the menagerie
879207 he would say that it should be called properly by its german term
879208 our friends here need to move on out of this dimension and to whatever after death existence is waiting for them why they are here specifically we dont know there is something about sophie that attracts
879209 this tea party is in your honor if what kitty there is saying is right they need something from you you not just anybody out on the street and you wont be able to get rid of them until they get it
879210 you dont have to make it sound so ominous raymond and i already figured out what needs to be done for him
879211 you said the name was on the saddle then all i need to do for him is make sure the guy is still at that address and then get a package to him that is if i can get it out of the garage downstairs without the landlady seeing me and calling the cops it ought to be pretty simple
879212 i think i have something that needs to be delivered too
879213 so why didnt you people just light in the fedex office
879214 look you just talk among yourselves for a while wherever it is you are when you arent here give me a few minutes to pretend i am still sane all right then i promise everything in my power everything within reason that is i will do what i can to help all of you just give me some time
879215 you stay were having supper like we planned im sorry i can only do one thing at a time that is where i start my brain isnt going to work otherwise and my body isnt all that far from crashing too
879216 this night and the next are the pit of the years days the bowl of darkness it has been called finish what has to be done before midnight tomorrow the door begins to close then if it closes too soon they will be trapped on the side of life again who knows when theyll have another chance
879217 they sometimes have one or two for sale take good care of their vehicles and they only buy clean used cars we sell some of our trade ins to them now and then and they are very particular about what they take if they dont have one for sale you might think about leasing for a month or so
879218 hey you didnt happen to see a green buick park avenue anywhere do you
879219 last week i didnt need a car so i sold it
879220 now i need a car i was going to buy it back they sold it
879221 if you would like to talk over a cup of coffee come on and get in any number of people would swear to my character ill even hand you my cell and you can call anyone on the list
879222 thanks i believe it will be better in the long run if i take a few minutes and pull myself together its very kind of you to offer
879223 you would not believe the night i had and the morning the only reason i dont think im going nuts is that everything is perfectly normal now
879224 between believing that there is some sort of psychic residue left of the strong emotions people felt when they were alive and the suspicion that something like subsonic waves disturbs the eyes and the brain why do you believe
879225 now ive found a place but it is a three mile walk back from work at night id like to find a used scooter if i cant find a cheap dependable car but either one may take a while to find guess ill see what kind of a deal i can get at renta wrek then i have a ton of shopping that place it needs so much
879226 well i dont i mean i do i enjoy window shopping and wandering around the stores but not having to buy things and not trying to make things look right what i like the looks of and what i choose to buy arent often the same
879227 that today were just now thought to be entering a
879228 up here in the window what are you doing there
879229 of course you are wherever you are is where youre supposed to be it makes perfect sense
879230 you are more than half way in already so i suppose you can the question you really want to ask is may i isnt that right because the two are entirely different
879231 whatever turned you into such a grump of course you could come into the garden if it were mine but it isnt so you probably ought to well you probably ought to get off the wall if you are seen it might not be
879232 oh do you think you could come down here and we could talk its a little difficult shouting up like this
879233 i could come down but down is one thing and out is another entirely you see the door is locked
879234 no no no i am supposed to be here silly it is just the way things are
879235 by that logic if i came inside the wall it would be where i was supposed to be because it would be where i would be
879236 how clever you are you are almost as clever as sophia
879237 no i meant something else it was just a phrase
879238 i knew that its just that so few people stop by to chat that i tend to become a little odd at times the jailer hardly talks at all so its no fun to play with him and sophia is so dreadfully clever and wise
879239 who knows i imagine its just the way its supposed to be thats probably what sophia would say
879240 did you do something wrong did you break some rule or something i dont mean to be nosy i only ask because when you dont know anything well i dont want the same thing happening to me you understand
879241 you hic dont know anything thats so good ill have to tell sophia the next time she comes to see me
879242 i said i didnt know where i was i said i was lost at the beginning
879243 and as to who you are you are an obnoxious child obviously locked away for your own good to keep sensible people from wringing your neck
879244 i hit it long and straight and hit a bunch of fairways when im swinging well and ive been striping it for about six weeks now its just a matter of making putts and it happened this week
879245 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
879246 the eclipse had a convertible top was pretty much a two seater and got about 18 miles per gallon
879247 the prius is getting about 45 mpg and that allows us to go to dallas to visit relatives again affordably

879249 i chauffeured a friends niece to her prom in this white cadillac it cost me 44 11 just for gasoline
879250 it was first come first served so i arrived friday at 7 45 a m a blue prius came in but it was for someone else
879251 i stayed the whole day and read a nice book in their coffee shop area
879252 my friend rick brought me lunch and i stayed until closing then i arrived saturday morning at 11 minutes after six
879253 to preach the gospel of cleanliness and economy and sanitation in every nook and corner of this city
879254 each laundry operator is instructed that besides wearing a snow white uniform they must be physically as well as morally clean when they handle the work of the customers
879255 a survey of the plant shows that over 95 percent of the laundrys owners are satisfied and not involved in any manner in the present difficulty
879256 there are wonderful opportunities coming from the decoupling of the emerging markets versus the main market economies
879257 the fact that were entering a slowdown in the main markets presents some opportunities too

879281 gosh it doesnt get much better gas mileage then my suv
879282 canadian gas typically contains no ethanol and thus they get better fuel economy
879283 the inability to finalize to put closure on an event brings depression
879284 what youve got is a bunch of people who arent having active thoughts about the storm
879285 we view the move to smaller more fuel efficient vehicles as permanent and we are responding to customer demand
879286 90 000 fewer pick ups and suvs in the second half of the year than it originally planned
879287 we are monitoring the water levels at each canal and are prepared to close them if water levels dictate
879288 it lowers their anxiety level when they have the pets here
879289 i dont know if it is the dogs but in general as they say dog is mans best friend when they come around patients really enjoy them
879290 they are special they teach us about love once you get into their heads you have to commit to them and you have to learn about them and love them and have an interactive relationship with them
879291 i could tell her anything she wouldnt tell anyone in my mind she was all mine
879292 i feed their animals take them for walks play with them schmooze with them
879293 i wanted to do something with my dogs i wanted to make my mark on the world
879294 the first time i went to a class i thought this is too much commitment too much liability
879295 but i gave it another week by the end of the second week i was committed i knew that this was something i wanted to do
879296 they have to be genuine and really show an interest in the people they visit
879297 if you are a person who wants to work with your dog then the dog will take as little as six weeks to learn
879298 they make you feel good they give you unconditional love
879299 i have a white shepherd that i have registered as a therapeutic dog
879300 they make you feel good they give you unconditional love
879301 although the device cost 500 000 to construct and it is unlikely it will ever pay off financially even with todays skyrocketing oil and gas prices the civil engineer says it is priceless in terms of what it does buy freedom from ever paying another heating or electric bill
879302 listening to the still small voice the story of george washington carver
879303 this performance will certainly show that there is more to dr carver than his 300 plus uses for the peanut
879304 these are not happy pictures by any means but you have to remember the time in which the artists were working
879305 with the growing dominance of abstraction many of the artists chose to move into their imaginations
879306 critics talked of it as a way of escaping what was going on during the war
879307 its just a wonderful gritty environment theres a sense of discovery
879308 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
879309 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
879310 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
879311 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
879312 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
879313 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls
879314 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
879315 on another pass through the storm the hurricane hunters noted the pressure was falling rapidly and winds were increasing
879316 at the very least we can expect to get some much needed rain from edouard
879317 if the storm intensifies into a hurricane we could also see some wind damage beach erosion and coastal flooding in our coastal communities
879318 hurricane alicia made landfall as a category three hurricane on aug 18 1983
879319 never sets up a shelter in the path of a storm
879320 there is a phone line people can call to find shelter if and when it is needed
879321 there is clearly data showing that exposure during adolescence has long lasting effects on the function of the brain when animals become adults
879322 i dont think there is any very compelling evidence that people develop more psychiatric problems anxiety depression or even psychosis as a result of marijuana use
879323 tobacco smoke is used in much higher doses you couldnt smoke 20 marijuana cigarettes a day and stay vertical
879324 experiencing certain symptoms of one or more six common mental health problems major depression minor depression suicidal thoughts generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder or ptsd
879325 more specifically symptoms of ptsd depression or both were seen in 6 5 per cent of returning cf personnel these are by far the most common operational stress injuries seen in the cf
879326 the only thing you have to remember is the aspect that if it is ptsd its the post thing we dont know when it will transpire thats just the snapshot right now cumulatively over time how many of 1 000 people who were in afghanistan eventually get it because some may only get ptsd or symptoms of it five years from now thats whats bizarre about it thats a snapshot in time of whenever they did the stats if you want to do it cumulatively overtime who knows how many will develop ptds
879327 in the last two years theres been a real effort to increase the number of mental health professionals so screening and serving the armed forces personnel weve made a post deployment decompression time so coming out of the theatre they have a little time to adjust before coming back to society
879328 weve almost doubled the number of mental health professionals which is difficult knowing theres a shortage of health professionals all across the country so youre competing with the public sector in general for health professionals who are in demand all over the country by and large we know that thereve been deficiencies in the past the armed forces are making great strides in moving forward and trying to address those needs
879329 canadian forces personnel came form different parts of canada but told basically the same story that they were not believed that they were made fun of that they were belittled
879330 i found the consistency of the testimony from soldiers and their families who testified as well of the barriers towards treatment and the barriers towards receiving mental health services that they needed to become well again and strong again which is not there for them each of those soldiers and each of their families told basically the same story and if anything surprised me it was just how similar each of these stories were
879331 ive certainly been in contact for over a year now with that young solider
879332 i wrote to defence minister mackay about that case months and months ago
879333 i had an email from a former client of mine who is in afghanistan right now and she was having some difficulties and she was able to go see the clinical social worker who is there in afghanistan that wasnt available to people who were on tours before so that to me is very preemptive
879334 research has demonstrated that people who are actually treated for ptsd and osi are good to go back to theatre they know what it is they know how to handle it they and know what to do in the situation its a treatable disorder people can go into remission we dont say theyre cured but they go into remission and with proper therapy theyre given all sorts of tools to stabilize to deal with the traumas and as they say theyre good to go and they are
879335 full spectrum high quality health services to canadas fighting forces wherever they serve it is responsible for all aspects of health care and well being of cf members at home and abroad including mental health care
879336 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them
879337 it was the family that raised me that rescued me
879338 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
879339 i think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life it stays with you all the time what you go through you cant throw it out of your memory
879340 my husband is very religious and doesnt especially care for the jews
879341 anytime he tried to say something against the jews i would tell him you forget who i am
879342 lois likes reese witherspoon because she played a similar part in walk the line
879343 my experiences post flight were ones of not being very productive for quite a while depression and alcoholism things like that i was trying to recover from that and ran into lois afterwards
879344 begged them to understand his morbid fear for the safety of the national capital that very day he had issued an order to organize the citys clerks and public works employees into infantry companies betraying a desperation worthy of the last ditch
879345 there can be no doubt gladstone observed over dessert that jefferson davis has made a nation of the south
879346 what we found from the trial was that people who used the guide with small amounts of telephone support had significant reductions in their level of depression
879347 it meant an awful lot to marcella to be able to help people less fortunate than herself and that is why she worked at lifeline
879348 she always felt the guide would be of great benefit for people to have something to hold something to work with
879349 she didnt really like to talk about what she was doing but we all knew if she wasnt working at lifeline she was thinking of lifeline

879354 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
879355 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
879356 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
879357 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
879358 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
879359 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
879360 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
879361 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
879362 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
879363 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
879364 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
879365 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up

879369 i thought we were beat at the top of the stretch when kent went to the whip but he showed his heart today
879370 i thought we had a hell of a shot turning for home
879371 i thought to myself we could do this again im very happy right now we made big brown run thats for sure
879372 i was sad for the race fans we didnt have that fantasy that storybook tale but today it feels so good to be right i feel like im holding a winning ticket
879373 he showed a lot of heart and determination in a side of big brown i didnt know existed until today
879374 prices are coming down so more people with entry level slrs are experimenting
879375 if you pick up the camera for the sake of creating an artistic thing and not just recording a family event youve really taken the plunge into serious photography anyone at that level is an ideal lightroom customer
879376 there are some things in lightroom 2 that delve into what photoshop has been used for in the past such as dodging burning and gradients
879377 photoshop excels at doing the detail work for high value images
879378 we want to make it possible to be everything you want and nothing you dont
879379 one of the tough things has been dealing with the enormous breadth of photoshop we end up presenting same interface to architects as a web designers as radiologists as prepress folks
879380 youll see some of the things weve learned about lightroom making things browsable and less modal come into photoshop
879381 our goal is to make it possible for expert users to reconfigure the environment on a task by task basis and share those workspaces with other people you dont have to write code you can knock together an interface and make it sharable
879382 its for every single person who picks up a digital slr takes the leap into raw space and questions the default interpretation from various raw converters because it doesnt match what was on the back of the camera less saturated more neutral or with less contrast

879388 there is an outmoded burmese proverb still recited by men who wish to deny that women too can play a part in bringing change to their society the dawn rises only when the rooster crows but burmese people today are well aware of the scientific reason behind the rising of dawn and the falling of dusk and the intelligent rooster surely realises that it is because dawn comes that it crows and not the other way around it crows to welcome the light that has come to relieve the darkness of night

879415 the thing to understand is that islam treats women as spiritual equals to men
879416 muslim women have the same obligation to pay charity to perform community service all of those things what looks different is that women wear more modest dress not to oppress or demean them but to allow them to be in the public space without being harassed or distracted
879417 it doesnt mean there arent people who use islam to justify oppression against women or other actions
879418 i think one of the reasons that is more of an issue is that muslim society still tends to be more religious so they have religious justifications for everything both good and bad
879419 she is very knowledgeable about islam and its history and i think she understands and respects the challenges we face here as american muslims
879420 she doesnt try to sugarcoat things these are the realities we face and this is the way we need to deal with it in the society we live in
879421 but the people she represents are very happy she is there
879422 a young woman came up to me and complained that whenever she tried to speak to a male student in the class he refused to look her in the eye
879423 she was very angry and said his actions were demeaning to women
879424 islam is not supposed to be about hurting peoples feelings
879425 respect on both sides is part of islamic guidelines but we have to step back and think does lowering your eyes refer to just looking and listening to a woman in conversation or is it about looking lustfully
879426 its a new challenge in certain areas because there are many people who go to the mosque and are very conservative about their religious practice
879427 even if its pointed out to them that what they do in the mosque is not necessarily religious
879428 when people are immigrants they have given up so much that they tend to hang on to these cultural markers
879429 the question is can we develop a way of interacting with each other that is more flexible
879430 now there is more of a sense of hardening in their views
879431 they are quite convinced that islam is a problem i give people the benefit of the doubt theres a lot of things i dont know going on in the world today but i try to give them facts because a lot of the things they assume are not based in fact

879441 whistler draws huge crowds and its a much bigger event in terms of length as well thats certainly something thats appealing to us and kind of a future goal to see that take place here as well
879442 we have great location our terrain is ideal for the mountain biking that youll see at crankworx were close to denver international airport and were expanding in terms of infrastructure at the base so there will be a new village next year with room for more exhibitors
879443 its great to see something like this in the states the hope would be to see the event get to the size and enthusiasm as the whistler event people just have to stick with it

879471 the pirating of a blockbuster novel onto the peer to peer networks is one of those seminal moments that is supposed to herald a new era wherein the old way books is cleared out by the new way computers e books and the days of paperbacks and hard bound volumes become marginalized to the sentimental periphery of culture along with vinyl records and postcards
879472 but the book world is a hard target for digital technology if anything the harry potter piracy should serve as an interesting anomaly whereas now cinema are quickly changing the landscape of communication and entertainment digital books seem to have had a much slower evolution if digital novel sharing marks the death of books i assure you it will be a long slow death

879481 people only began to realise then that the tickets theyd paid for wont be coming
879482 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
879483 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
879484 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
879485 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
879486 oh its great and im really excited to go down there and see what i can do

879508 but i would not expect there wouldnt be starters who come from the p m practice because with this freshman class i think therell be some guys starting and i think therell be some guys playing a lot of football for us
879509 i think these young freshmen are pretty capable and frankly id much rather have a guy have a chance at playing and learning in a freshman year if he truly had a chance to be a starter in his sophomore year
879510 i look at all of my past talks so i see exactly what i was thinking really for the three years prior to this and i am pretty much in the same position that i was in not only for last years team but each year prior to

879512 we think downtown asheville is perfect for a multimedia company
879513 in any job those first 365 days you learn more than you probably do in the next five years combined there isnt the feeling of anxiety heading into your second season
879514 there is no doubt that being with your team for a second year is a big factor
879515 every place i have been we have had a great second year at that point everyone has bought into what you are trying to do the players and staff are all better off
879516 you get to know your team and get your recruits into your depth chart in your second season
879517 that helps you to be a better coach its much easier for me now that i have been at arkansas state for a while
879518 i found out in my first year that the talent level on defense is a lot better at the college level
879519 the cornerbacks in college are a lot more talented and a lot more athletic
879520 the demands on your time are a lot higher and your responsibility for your players is a lot greater because they are living away from home and mom and dad are not right there
879521 kids grab the towels and the sun screen were gonna indulge in an all day relaxathon at the pool
879522 have you lost your mind i thought you had drowned

879526 heathers friends never stop texting me and calling me just to let me know theyre thinking of me
879527 they said that until i spoke to them they had no idea about what to do or that they could get help
879528 it was a coincidence that they were sold not done because of the illness as it turned out the timing was right considering the economy there was a recession down there we also had a body shop and that business was really slow you had people who couldnt pay their mortgage they werent going to pay to get their cars fixed
879529 the kid goes home because of his fathers illness the dad made it but they had to sell the businesses he did what any quality young man would do go home and help your dad he has a 3 6 gpa if the young man doesnt get a sixth year it will be a crying shame

879539 india and afghanistan are likely to be engaged in defence co operation and small development projects and help in local self governance
879540 not only pakistan even the us will have anxiety on the issue the us would like india and afghanistans co operation up to a point to push pakistan to deliver
879541 as india cannot object to pakistans relation with say bangladesh pakistan should not have any grouses when india helps afghanistan you must remember that india built roads on its western border only because pakistan steadfastly refuses access to india from the eastern side
879542 the war in afghanistan is part of pakistans larger struggle with india afghanistan has been a prize that pakistan and india have fought over directly and indirectly for decades to pakistan afghanistan represents a strategic rare base that would along with the islamic nations of ex soviet central asia offer a united front against hindu dominated india and block its rivals access to energy rich regions conversely for india a friendly afghanistan would pressure pakistan on its western border just as india itself pressures pakistan on its eastern border thus dealing pakistan a strategic defeat
879543 the karzai government has openly and brazenly strengthened its ties with india and allowed indian consulates in jalalabad kandahar herat and mazar e sharif it has kept alive the possibility of inviting india to help train the new afghan army and to help in dam construction in the northeastern afghan province of kunar abutting pakistan all this has driven the isi wild with fear and anger
879544 one thing we never understood is that india has always been the major threat for pakistan
879545 we are unlike european donors we are picking up only those project afghan people want us to do we are not imposing our idea of development
879546 youre going to want to stand out of the way

879643 so yeah i take it personally but its not the first time and it probably wont be the last time
879644 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight i know if they do open up the competition not a lot of people will give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and coach will decide from there
879645 the production wasnt there whether it was on the front or the back end of the pass play
879646 its nice to stand up here and say when the offence scores four touchdowns in the scrimmage boy we feel good about it then you watch the film and it goes both ways its never as good as you think it is and its usually not as bad as you think it is ill just say this its quality film
879647 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback im not going to take any direction weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation well have monday but we have all the confidence in the world in aaron i think hes a player thats on time hes earned this opportunity three years preparing for it and ive very comfortable with him as our starting quarterback
879648 i think the organization has been put in a tough spot
879649 its a difficult situation when brett decided to change his mind but were going to welcome him back to the team ive got an opportunity if i dont win the competition then ill support brett and well move forward together
879650 if favre comes back aaron is going to be hot
879651 theres no point in extending my contract until i play
879652 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
879653 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighborhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
879654 i think the new art in china is much more exciting than the new art in new york or london or germany
879655 the true art in the international world of real significance is coming from china
879656 up to now no one gallery can compare to pace for history or quality and power
879657 hes the iconic artist of china and the artist who has probably reached the highest levels of the auction market but also a really unique original vision of china
879658 most of his paintings are like passport photographs theyre called bloodline paintings
879659 if zhang xiaogang is the johns of china zhang huan is the rauschenberg just somebody who is a great performance artist who every day has a new style this is a very methodical kind of introspective artist
879660 western figurative art at this moment in history has very little narrative or meaning its tweaking
879661 this is all about their narrative its very very pertinent and its very exciting theyre making art because they have to theres real meaning to this art
879662 its like a whole town an art town an art city the youth is amazing here and the feeling of power interest the will to learn the will to expand the energy
879663 that is the best sort of raw building ive ever seen
879664 the arches with the north facing skylights are better than something louis kahn had done my approach to a space like that was to do as little as possible
879665 the major chinese artists none of them wanted to be represented by a gallery because they are still so scarred by the early 90s when two bit dealers would buy up all their artworks and sit on them
879666 sign of the political will on the part of the international community
879667 if the icc goes ahead then every troop contributor has to be concerned
879668 dude this is more jammed than it was at incubus
879669 the majority of people meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail
879670 insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
879671 without your constant high energy focus willingness to put up with a lot of pushback great creative ideas and wherewithall to push ahead we would be nowhere near as far as we are now

879702 theres so much production involved in the costuming and the visual effects
879703 i worry that someone coming in for four or eight years couldnt learn that job in that time

879705 it will be years before we find another one like her
879706 i dont know why the clerk is included in the limits the city clerks more of a department head
879707 chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
879708 it was pretty good i saw people having barbecue on the side of the street it was a good race
879709 people put up tents in the front yards they have a party they have a get together its been a huge success this thing is going to be here for a long time to come
879710 we made it on the podium for the first time im excited i told them i wont raise anybodys taxes i got on the podium
879711 the shoulder is really sore at the moment you just got to keep it as still as you can but its ok in general
879712 this is right up there with downers grove and downer avenue up in milwaukee all of the superweek events
879713 we sat out in their front yard and watched them go all the way up the road its pretty neat
879714 i was really nervous i dont know why its been a long time
879715 fastball averaged 93 miles per hour and topped out at 95
879716 this first year after surgery is kind of hit and miss maybe next year youre going to see everything step up even more right now i think hes missing velocity more than anything

879719 liriano at 80 percent is better than a lot of pitchers in the big leagues
879720 youve got three supply side worries pushing oil higher today iran the storm and nigeria
879721 taking my first snap i went to the line took a deep breath and thought to myself just have fun out here tonight
879722 more than his throws what i was pleased with is how he was looking to the right guy when he was backpedaling
879723 he knew the plays knew the routes he should feel very good about his performance
879724 i didnt know how long i was going to play but that first series was a long one
879725 coach said that was enough to get my work in i was happy to get to play with a lot of the more experienced players
879726 we did a lot of good things a lot of things to be pleased about
879727 theres always the mistakes and thats what weve got to work on
879728 for the first game i dont have anything to be disappointed about
879729 i was excited to have a big turnover for a touchdown at the end that shows the guys playing it all the way through
879730 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
879731 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
879732 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
879733 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
879734 im excited its good to have him back in the house
879735 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
879736 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
879737 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
879738 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
879739 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
879740 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback
879741 im not going to change any direction that weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation tomorrow and we have all the confidence in the world in aaron
879742 zip off pants i think you mean convertible pants pants with zip off pants would be more like the kind of pants male strippers wear
879743 most experts are in agreement that its inevitable that we will become totally infested over time
879744 when that will happen i cant say its pretty grim
879745 it got here by accident and its taking advantage of the food source here
879746 this isnt the first time this kind of thing happened
879747 these things happen and its not coincidental that theyre all invasive pests that cause these things
879748 ash is a very popular tree because it has a lot of qualities that make it a good tree for landscaping
879749 there is no saving the tree once you start seeing symptoms its kind of too late

879758 and i really want to sing this year because the cubs are going to the world series
879759 my brother is the biggest cubs fan in the world
879760 i am very aware and grateful for what rcl has done for my daughter and know what they do for the other clients i want to give back by helping out so that other disabled people can have the same type of help that my daughter has received
879761 most of their clients are people that would fall through the cracks if it werent for rcl because they dont fit the criteria for permanent residential living
879762 to offer adults with developmental and or physical disabilities opportunities to achieve greater self esteem dignity and participation in all aspects of community life through affordable housing options individualized skill instruction and necessary support services
879763 a person who eats sleeps and drinks rcl she is totally dedicated to the needs of our clients many of whom do not have families and to our volunteers many of whom are also clients we are a young organization we need more volunteers and we also need people who are willing to act as mentors for our clients
879764 we take our legacy of providing trustworthy and balanced resources to citizens and lawmakers seriously
879765 the league of women voters truly has left its footprint on american history and i believe our democracy is stronger because of it
879766 its one way for a lot of people to see the candidates face to face at the same time and on a level playing field
879767 and we think we ask better questions than the press more issue orientated questions and less gotcha questions
879768 how candidates answer voters questions is very revealing so a forum provides an important opportunity for local voters to hear candidates in an unfiltered format
879769 i just said to my team now we take control and i just cruised to the finish
879770 we bike around because we dont want to pay for gas
879771 road racing is a little more exciting since theres a broader field

879773 its pretty cool that its a major event here in elk grove our little hamlet
879774 i just didnt leave the house when i was in a fib
879775 its a concern because it can be difficult to pass a needle through
879776 in ganschows case we turned the radio frequency on and the baylis device went right into the left atrium one try very easy
879777 speaking to us at medical conferences many doctors have expressed to us their intention to switch over completely to the nrg needle
879778 i just thought 80 had a better ring to it
879779 in a few years hopefully well look back and think how silly it was the way we were poking needles through like that
879780 im just looking forward to having a normal life where i dont have to pretend to tie my shoes in a store because im getting dizzy and need to put my head down
879781 i dont want the state to take a role in telling us what to do
879782 my job in district 214 is try to do the best i can for this community
879783 the people here like what the schools provide and we cant endanger that
879784 if this is the land of opportunity then we as a state and as a society have an obligation to create those opportunities for everyone as best we can
879785 would a different kind of tax be as reliable i think its still pretty unclear
879786 but at the same time we never have enough i would like to see schools all over the state funded better but im not sure at this point how wed go about it
879787 i think there would be a way to make it work without hurting the kids out here in the suburbs but wed have to put aside politics to get there
879788 as a statewide system were only as strong as our weakest link
879789 if were failing to educate children somewhere whether its st charles or chicago or anywhere in the state and we have to remediate them down the line in the prison system or elsewhere thats not a good way of doing things
879790 has also led a one man crusade to keep the american people ignorant about what is at stake in the debate over off shore drilling
879791 repealed as of the date of enactment of this act
879792 this pleasant sounding bill has provisions buried within its language that would impose many billions of dollars of foreign aid obligations on america up to 845 billion in the next 13 years over and above what we already give in foreign aid
879793 you know i actually liked you better when you were stealing my hubcaps
879794 if i could just transfer one tenth of my awesomeness to other people you know like sell some of it people would be all over that
879795 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be

879829 the pastor in our church who was among those who refused to leave the area eventually came out early this week leading all those who remained behind with him
879830 there are no more people living in abana they have all come back to ikang and akpabuyo and even to calabar and no more business there
879831 we predicate our submission on the fact that the green tree agreement was a self serving agreement borne out of the desire of ex president olusegun obasanjo to gain international recognition in his bid for life presidency
879832 we are constrained to agree that president umaru yaradua as a beneficiary of the failure of third term cannot consign this agreement to the dust bin of history and allow the people of bakassi and other parts of nigeria ceded to benefit from the exit of obasanjo and consequently the fall of third term
879833 as security agencies we are not worried about the clash among the cult groups in the state that started on tuesday let them expend their ammunition on themselves this inter cult war is like a sign of good omen from security point of view so long as it does not affect innocent lives with what is happening now we are seeing the end of militancy in the state
879834 security agencies are monitoring the situation to see that it does not claim innocent lives it is to protect innocent lives that we had to intervene in abonnema also
879835 i remember at ogoloma jetty they attempted to surprise our troops located to guard caw thorn channel marine base territorial waters etc when they came close our gunboats sank two of their speed boats with the occupants it is not always we like to say this or that number has been killed we dont like counting death tolls on the pages of newspapers this is why we dont record our operational successes on the pages of the papers
879836 it was probably to stop the task force that the crude oil thieves organised some criminals posing as niger delta militants to attack the troops
879837 there was an encounter yesterday saturday night between our troops and militants at our duty location at bomadi and no single casualty on our own troops
879838 the commander jtf brigadier general nanven rimtip has condemned the development and warned those behind it to stop or the task force will be left with no option than to pay back which will be catastrophic
879839 general rimtip assured the public and oil companies that the jtf are on top of the situation and reiterated his commitment in curbing the menace of illegal oil bunkering activities and other crimes in the region
879840 so called criminals are afraid that some leaders of the area are out to dislodge them and they are fighting back
879841 why are they afraid that some people have guns they are just frightened that the people are prepared to flush them out of the area and they think the next thing to do is to kidnap their kinsmen
879842 the mend men are blackmailers they are going into militancy to collect money from government
879843 they were trying to create economic and political empire for themselves their action was illegal and unconstitutional because they were not authorised by government to be carrying guns

879848 he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
879849 its really out of my control as much as it affects our team and it affects me personally with him coming back its out of my control
879850 i wasnt really worried about it and now that hes back i guess i have a shot to compete

879875 the headline of this report is not so much a prediction of sudden demise as it is a play on a 1998 report by forrester research
879876 the power of online video centers on the ability for viewers to interact with content and control their own entertainment experiences

879889 i could feel his greatness or maybe it was the waffles
879890 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well
879891 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
879892 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
879893 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
879894 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
879895 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients
879896 resistant to insect infestation such as termites because the feathers are inedible
879897 they are also not as flammable or combustible as conventional cement and wood fibre composite boards
879898 conventional waste disposal methods when applied to chicken feathers are problematic
879899 incineration releases greenhouse gases and the feathers take up a lot of space in landfills and take a long time to decay because of the keratin protein that make up the feathers
879900 there is also the fear of bird flu which makes converting chicken feathers into animal feeds undesirable
879901 if the study results are good then we will apply for a patent and publish the study
879902 the next step would be to form a partnership with a company that can maximise this technology perhaps local food giant san miguel corp which has purefoods as a subsidiary company and through purefoods operates large poultry farms nationwide
879903 proud to be involved in such an exciting and ecologically relevant project
879904 our support for this endeavour underscores our commitment to finding sustainable solutions in protecting and maintaining our environment
879905 an invaluable resource for understanding the evolutionary record of earth over a geological time frame
879906 we take mussels from clean waters and place them at points we wish to analyse in order to see how much and what kind of contamination is accumulated
879907 it is known that ports are contaminated what we are investigating is to what extent the contaminants therein reach aquatic organisms
879908 we take mussels from clean waters and place them at points we wish to analyse in order to see how much and what kind of contamination is accumulated
879909 the galician biologists are in charge of studying the consequences of the contaminants on the mussels we measure the concentration of the contaminants received by the mussels
879910 today tbt is banned but it is highly durable and it can still be found in waters
879911 these last are similar to dioxines and in the past were used in very powerful transformers they are also prohibited but are still present in the water
879912 we place 20 or 30 mussels mounted on plastic supports and inside gauzes and submerge them at a depth of two metres
879913 after a certain period we collect them for analysis of level and type of contamination accumulated
879914 in some cases the contamination is high and the mussels can die
879915 by using polymeric mountings we simulate chemically what the mussels do i e accumulate contaminants
879916 the situation in the port of bilbao is quite homogenous we have taken samples in the areas of getxo santurce and the exterior port bilbao in the basque country and the results are similar in each case on the other hand in vigo galicia we detected wide differences from one zone to another for example between water near a shipyard and the open sea
879917 we wish to know if our methodology and the sampling tools that we have developed are useful for this purpose
879918 on the one hand we have seen that zones supposedly clean are not as clean as we thought it is necessary to redefine the selection of these clean zones on the other we are also perfecting the tool that chemically simulates the role of the mussels in order to carry out even more precise sampling
879919 there is no indicator that we are going to have it yet but we are concerned with the increasing number of hotspots
879920 we are doing our best to avoid any open burning here in the country
879921 donations are voluntary and donors have no say over the use of the resources

879923 the solution to our water problems is the red dead canal project
879924 some insects have adapted to life underwater by using this bubble as an external lung
879925 because the bubble acts as an external lung its surface area must be sufficiently large to facilitate the exchange of gases
879926 it has been in the family since around 1760 and it belonged to a benedictine convent before that
879927 the figure of 16 million euros has been mentioned but i dont want to comment about that
879928 i have had so many mostly estate agents from austria neighbouring bavaria and germany
879929 we manage most of the austrian lakes so by principle were interested in taking over the mondsee
879930 we recently made an alternative offer to mrs waechter well manage the lake for her for free for two years during which she will continue to receive revenues from it and then well make an offer to buy
879931 there has been a spectacular advance but we are still very short of the mark
879932 one of the tasks of the conference is to address the fact that there are three million people who now get the drugs but another nine million who do not
879933 we are increasing a plants efficiency for water uptake plants that can sense water in a better fashion will be higher in economic value in the future
879934 we are developing plants that are more efficient in sensing water
879935 the world faces a global climate emergency it is now clear that only action by both developed and developing countries can prevent the climate crisis from deepening
879936 the aim is to limit global temperature increases to two degrees above pre industrial levels
879937 the time is right for the countrys private sector to show leadership by partnering with government to develop a solutions driven national climate change mitigation and adaptation response
879938 the cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change
879939 our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries south africas emissions per capita are also high due to our coal based energy system
879940 our analysis shows that putting a price on carbon has the single largest impact on emissions by using the price signal it sends signals to all actors in the economy and can shift behaviour
879941 good morning time to get up todays forecast calls for by the way remember to stop by mcdonalds and pick up the new chicken mc sandwich for just ninety nine cents
879942 were aware of new media and were all over that when you buy from us we automatically make sure that not only are you advertising on the station youre also on the internet podcasts myspace pages and youre even rotated on our telephone wake up service for our most loyal listeners viewers
879943 look the yellow pages newspaper is a good medium that is its a big lake with lots of fish in it i also represent a big lake with lots of fish but mr tire man in your particular product service category wouldnt you agree that the newspaper yellow pages is being a little over fished when somebody comes to the newspaper yellow pages theyre shopping all of your competitors every single one of you has a line in the water when you use the newspaper yellow pages but look at our nice lake we have thousands of consumers who will need tires sooner or later and we dont have one single tire dealer fishing on our lake youd practically have a monopoly here on our lake
879944 uggghhh are these people really representative of your stations audience
879945 this was a stupid promotion with nothing but a few pizzas as an incentive and you get what you pay for and im sick of taking the heat and being punished because you advertise these lame events that only our twelve most wretched listeners would ever want to attend
879946 the high price of gasoline has everybodys attention right now especially if you commute the vehicle youre driving now may not get good mileage but nine of our new models at ford get over thirty miles to the gallon everybody says that gasoline prices will continue to go up not down think of how much money ford can put back in your pocket by getting you into a more fuel efficient vehicle right now
879947 if your present vehicle is over three years old it may not have side airbags but of our new models have side airbags as standard equipment that means that you and your family are much safer in a new car from test drive one right now at and get yourself and your family into a safer vehicle as soon as you can for example our new model has side airbags very responsive handling and anti lock brakes as standard equipment things like that really do make a big difference when you are confronted with a potentially dangerous situation
879948 if you havent test driven the new at chevrolet you wont believe what youre missing the car has the look and feel of a real sports car because thats what it is the is designed for up to five passengers but you will not believe the acceleration handling and braking the dashboard is sporty and functional bathed in amber light the seats steering wheel and shifter are designed after those in an actual sports car and the handles so much better on slick roads and around curves than the family car youre driving now with all wheel drive the is probably much safer than your current car with standard side airbags and much more fun to drive
879949 you dont have to compromise size to get a more fuel efficient vehicle
879950 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
879951 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
879952 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
879953 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
879954 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up
879955 whats unique about obama and his candidacy is that almost none of the stuff the press throws at him sticks
879956 you could call obama the teflon coated candidate but this would miss the fact that his slickness goes all the way to the core
879957 i know that according to reports that he wanted to bring media people and cameras and his campaign staffers
879958 if senator obama isnt comfortable meeting wounded american troops without his entourage perhaps he does not have the experience necessary to serve as commander in chief
879959 it is safe to say that according to press reports barack obama avoided skipped canceled the visit because of those reasons
879960 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems
879961 he who dies with the most toys still dies and i steal their toys
879962 the governor has been pretty clear from the beginning when senator obama asked him to be a national co chair that any conversation he has with the campaign on any topic are conversations that he is keeping private
879963 with independence whos willing to tell me where he thinks or she thinks im wrong
879964 in order to help him get the nomination of his party
879965 senator obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions
879966 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
879967 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into youre less patriotic than me
879968 hagel said on john mccain very much johns better than that
879969 john mccain is an honorable man running an increasingly dishonorable campaign
879970 i think a lot of people are wondering what happened to the civil campaign john mccain said he was going to run
879971 i say that it was very clear that a decision had to be made and i made it when it wasnt popular he made a decision which was popular with his base and that is a fundamental difference
879972 im not prepared to see the sacrifice of so many brave young americans lost because senator obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions
879973 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
879974 seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras john mccain is always there for our troops mccain country first
879975 triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political
879976 it would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props
879977 i think people make a judgment by what we do and what we dont do he certainly found time to do other things if i had been told by the pentagon that i couldnt visit those troops and i was there and wanted to be there i guarantee you there would have been a seismic event
879978 churlish and unlike mccain and hardly will resonate with the swing voters who are going to decide this election
879979 theyre doing it because the candidate and the campaign is not happy with where they are and theyre lashing out
879980 housing prices have already fallen 15 percent and they need to fall 10 percent more this bill isnt going to change that equation
879981 this legislation will not perform miracles i want the american people to have realistic expectations about what were about to do
879982 but as others have said it is a step and an important step towards putting our nation on the road to economic recovery
879983 this is not the bill he would have drafted on his own but its time for action
879984 who have been caught between rising mortgage payments and falling home values and are in danger of losing their homes
879985 everything is so unstable and people are so panicky that i see a lot of this as an effort to calm people down
879986 the whole bill is an attempt to change the equilibrium
879987 clearly in areas where home prices have dropped its going to be utilized more
879988 it also depends on the borrowers unique financial circumstances why are they struggling did they lose their job if its a temporary hardship then youre not going to use this program at all if its something of greater significance then this may be the best option
879989 how effective can the fha refinancing program be in light of how slow and ineffective mortgage servicers have been so far
879990 people of the world look at berlin where a wall came down a continent came together and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
879991 proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
879992 it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
879993 id love to give a speech in germany a political speech or a speech that maybe the german people would be interested in but i would much prefer to do it as president of the united states rather than as a candidate for the office of the presidency
879994 you have billed this event as a presidential town hall and i sincerely hope that the next president is here today
879995 my opponent of course is traveling in europe and tomorrow his tour takes him to france in a scene lance would recognize a throng of adoring fans awaits senator obama in paris and thats just the american press
879996 defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
879997 the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic cannot stand
879998 the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
879999 senator obama had hoped to and had every intention of visiting our troops to express his appreciation and gratitude for their service to our country
