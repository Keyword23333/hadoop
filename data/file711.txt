7110084 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7110085 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7110086 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7110087 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7110088 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave

7110103 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7110104 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7110105 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe

7110173 four batches have so far taken the class viii exam in the first batch only three four kids passed out of 10 15 as they did not have exam training but when the second batch took the test around 14 children cleared it considering that most of their parents are illiterate these kids are doing very well
7110174 on an average out of a batch of 30 children that enrolls in the primary section 20 25 are there with us in class viii
7110175 children in urban slums are one of the most deprived and marginalized groups in most cities there are no schools which cater to their specific needs at least in jaipur we have changed that situation through various interventions
7110176 the various elements of good education are well known what we have done is to put this enlightened framework into practice for deprived children we strive to bring education which has quality and is democratic as well as non discriminatory

7110194 but we went dancing and im absolutely starving and astrids thrown everything else out hasnt she
7110195 werent you supposed to put in some hours at the lab tonight
7110196 okay so the other day i read this really freaky article about this woman who was really fucked up she had been a heroine addict and she got aids from a contaminated needle and basically her life was really shitty but she manages to get out of it get herself through rehab and actually find a job right
7110197 unfortunately she still has aids but her symptoms are under control except sometimes she gets these outbreaks of shingles i think its shingles those itchy red patches she gets them on her scalp after one episode of having them they still itch even after theyve cleared up they itch and itch and itch and this is where it gets really gross she starts scratching her head in her sleep she cant help it anyway she rubs right through the skin and has to go to the hospital
7110198 so they give her a skin graft but then she rubs right through that one night she wakes up and theres this greenish fluid running down the side of her face it turned out
7110199 that she had scratched all the way through her skull and to her brain
7110200 i know they had to institutionalize her because even though she wasnt crazy she was still a danger to herself she had to stay in a mental hospital for years and underwent neurosurgery to sever her main sensory nerve but get this it still itched
7110201 well apparently theyve been able to keep it under relative control with topical anaesthesia but she still suffers
7110202 because alex is like that itch it just wont go away and its driving me insane penetrating my very bones and no matter what i try it persists
7110203 cass surely surely you are not comparing your break up to this womans suffering
7110204 okay youre right im over exaggerating i guess im more like the guy without the arm who feels like his fist is clenched painfully tight all the time how can you sooth a pain that doesnt exist thats how i feel i think a chunk of my heart is missing but it still aches as if it were there as if alex were still there do you know how they helped the people
7110205 with mirrors its a new therapy they got the man to look in a mirror only they set it up somehow so it looked like he still had both his arms and when he unclenched his fist in the mirror for fifteen minutes over the course of a few days he finally felt the relief that all the pain medication in the world hadnt been able to give him
7110206 i dont know i need to convince my heart that its whole again somehow that it beats just the same i thought the answer was to cut it out maybe or to numb it but it and i both know better and its still twisted into these painful contortions
7110207 that maybe you can find your heart reflected in other people people who love you

7110427 the 3g does not make me talk any faster laugh if i bring up a web page and it takes me an extra second or even minute i am not worried as edge or 3g works very well i can see if your in the middle of a train track and a train is coming and you were wondering what time it left the station before you get hit by it i can see then how 3g heck 10g would be really a good thing for you before you get hit be happy

7110430 a t the time of the black death a young man teitur and a young woman sigga saw a dense fog lying like a carpet over the whole area they found that everyone was dead
7110431 after reading your interview with william bramley i thought of an interesting icelandic expression that dates back to the black death era n kemur til teits og siggu which translates now its in the hands of teitur and sigga and means that one does not have enough information about something and has to seek council this is how the expression came about at the time of the black death a young man teitur and a young woman sigga lived in a community of a few hundred people called lafsfj r ur fjord of olaf on the north coast of iceland in the autumn they took a several day trip to the mountains to collect herbs as they returned standing on the top of a mountain with the whole fjord in view they saw a dense fog lying like a carpet over the whole area due to the moderate climate and near constant wind from the sea this was highly unusual and there was something about the fog that struck them as unusual and made them afraid enough to sleep on the mountain until the fog lifted when they finally came down they found that everyone was dead later when relatives of the deceased had to decide property rights ownership and such they had to turn to teitur and sigga for advice thus the above expression
7110432 the interview with william bramley is great i look at the world around me and shake my head something strange is taking place its true that big money controls the media so it would be easy to control peoples understanding of our times by means of the so called free press i can imagine corporations wanting to gain an advantage by lowering pollution standards for example but the people at the very top they are smart people they know that global warming is a serious problem they know that there is no escape from pollution they could encourage an energy policy that taxes the hell out of recreational combustion of fossil fuels these are just some examples why arent the richest people in the world doing more to work toward the common good of the planet it seems to me it is in their best interest at least for the sake of their grandchildren ten thousand years of civilization and we havent figured out how not to do war ancient religious traditions that lock a persons mind and heart in a faith box of systematized beliefs preventing us from becoming the divine beings i believe we are by nature governments that talk about a culture of life while punishing those who speak the truth is it crazy to imagine a power greater than the richest of the human rich actively working to keep humanity from realizing who we are a race of alien beings influencing our cultures for their own agendas makes much more sense than the world i see around me
7110433 just got through reading your interview with the author of the above mentioned book it really hit a nerve with me for i have felt for a long time now that we were the property of some one else not that the idea makes me happy still ive pondered about what could they possibly get from us because if they are all that powerful what need would they have looking around at the world there is a great deal of suffering that goes on more so than joy so maybe they feed off the negative energies produced by wars and confrontations after all ive found that hate anger and violent death create a lot stronger emotional energy than love or joy maybe thats why all those figures throughout history who preached love and kindness were eventually killed for if everyone started feeling that way our owners wouldnt derive the same amount of pleasure that they get from the opposite of that for obviously we exist for someone elses pleasure and im sure laugh at us if they are capable of such an emotion still there has to be more to it than that the idea of souls being recycled ive always felt was true also that once reborn we dont consciously remember our previous experience yet i believe that on some level of that subconscious we do and maybe thats why under past life regression we can remember certain lives in bits and pieces i dont feel that the process is a quick one though because how would one explain my having seen my deceased wife on 4 different occasions since she passed not to mention all the other people ive read about with such experiences there has to be some way to defeat this process there always is we just havent discovered how yet probably because we havent really discovered how the process really works

7110507 hay una delgada l nea entre la realidad y la fantas a el reino de arte no tiene esta frontera aqu es donde encuentro mi santuario
7110508 una parte de mi obra de arte es creado digitalmente
7110509 es la naturaleza humana de tener una fascinaci n por lo desconocido
7110510 there is a fine line between reality and fantasy the realm of artistry does not have this boundary this is where i find my sanctuary
7110511 a portion of my artwork is created digitally but the other half is created physically traditional mediums it would be easy for me to be nothing but a digital artist although digital is only one piece of the puzzle i usually have an idea or emotion i want to bring to life through art and its generated through various mediums this is where it all begins no picture is completely done the same way some portions may come from pieces i painted and then scanned in and others may come from just photos i use adobe photoshop as my compositing tool
7110512 its human nature to have a fascination for the unknown its human nature to slow down your car a bit to see an accident on the side of the road we fear the situation but we are also exhilarated by its reaction we have seen our share of angel depictions but the world needs balance the fantastical provides a release a moment of connection a moment of release from reality a moment of wonder that wonder exist both in the light and the dark i have just chosen to show that darkness and reference it through my emotions from monsters to myths to surrealism i try to show things that may not be present in your day to day life it is as simple as that

7110531 alles was ich anpacke und selber regeln kann das macht mir keine angst ich habe mein leben immer aktiv in die hand genommen und versucht das beste daraus zu machen letztendlich ist es mir gelungen
7110532 das ist nicht perfekt aber es ist passiert da muss ich mit leben
7110533 ich habe versucht ihr alles zu erm glichen reitunterricht ausfl ge an die havel
7110534 es hat finanziell hinten und vorn nicht gereicht trotz des knappen geldes sind wir jeden monat einmal essen gegangen immer in einem anderen nationalit ten restaurant chinesisch jugoslawisch deutsch damit sie und ihre ein jahr j ngere schwester die unterschiede kennen lernten und richtig am tisch zu sitzen und sich zu benehmen bten
7110535 ich habe mich oft gefragt welche fehler ich gemacht habe
7110536 ich begreife bis heute nicht wie so etwas passieren konnte verstehen sie das ist f r mich berhaupt nicht begreifbar denn ich habe mich nach besten wissen und gewissen bem ht
7110537 dann bekomme ich angst angst um das m del angst um christianes leben tags ber kann ich mich mit hausarbeit ablenken aber nachts da st rzten die gedanken auf mich ein wo ist sie was macht sie wie lange wird sie noch durchhalten ich habe solche angst dass das telefon klingelt und jemand sagt christiane wurde tot aufgefunden davor habe ich heftige angst
7110538 ich habe mich oft gefragt welche fehler ich gemacht habe was h tte ich anders machen m ssen
7110539 ich h tte meinen ex mann fr her rausschmei en und wieder aus berlin wegziehen sollen
7110540 er zog den bambusstock der den gummibaum hielt aus dem blumentopf dann drosch er mit dem bambusstock auf meinen hintern bis man buchst blich die haut abziehen konnte
7110541 es ist im nachhinein schwer zu verstehen dass ich es so lange mit ihm ausgehalten habe
7110542 aber ich bin von zu hause so erzogen worden man l sst sich nicht scheiden man bleibt zusammen bis der tod einen scheidet und wahrscheinlich war es auch der stolz meinem vater zeigen zu wollen dass ich alleine durchkomme
7110543 schwanger zu werden das war die einzige m glichkeit zu hause wegzukommen
7110544 morgens um sechs uhr bin ich meistens losgegangen und erst abends um sechs wieder gekommen
7110545 danach noch heimarbeit schreibauftr ge f r eine firma an den wochenenden war ich nachts kellnern von acht bis f nf uhr morgens
7110546 heute glaube ich ich h tte mich einfach mehr um die kinder k mmern sollen als arbeiten zu gehen ich habe sie viel zu oft sich selbst berlassen christiane fehlte einfach der halt und geborgenheit sie h tte eine st rkere f hrung gebraucht
7110547 ich war richtig gl cklich und zufrieden und habe gedacht da ist sie gut aufgehoben
7110548 dass sie dort an die drogen kommt das h tte ich im traum nicht gedacht
7110549 ich habe nicht mit ihr geschimpft weil ich immer ein schlechtes gewissen hatte im gegenteil ich habe alles durchgehen lassen um ja kein b ses blut rein zu bringen ich h tte mal strenger sein sollen aber das widerstrebte mir den ganzen tag nicht f r meine kinder da sein zu k nnen und sie dann auch noch anzumeckern
7110550 mein m del hatte ja immer f r alles eine entschuldigung
7110551 ich habe meine tage gekriegt mein bauch tut so weh ihr ist immer etwas eingefallen und da habe ich mir auch selber etwas vorgemacht indem ich mir gesagt habe wird schon so sein
7110552 nat rlich war da immer misstrauen aber dann habe ich die l gen geglaubt weil man eigentlich lieber m chte dass alles in ordnung ist das ist weniger anstrengend
7110553 wenn man so viel arbeitet da bin ich ehrlich dann schlampert man halt ich h tte einfach mehr nachfragen sollen aber ich war immer heilfroh wenn ich eine antwort von ihr bekam die meine schlimmen bef rchtungen nicht best tigte
7110554 bei christianes vater war das hnlich der hat es ihr in der kindheit vorgelebt der suchte auch immer anerkennung in merkw rdigen gruppen er war nur mit pennern und banditen zusammen
7110555 vielleicht hat sie sich immer neue leute gesucht weil sie eine richtige familie haben wollte nicht so eine wie sie hatte sie hat uns wahrscheinlich nie als familie gesehen
7110556 ich f hle mich nach all den jahren v llig hilflos
7110557 sonst h tte ich das doch wohl alles nicht ber 30 jahre mit ihr mitgemacht ich habe immer alles erledigt und besorgt es ging immer muttichen hilfst du mir mal da muttichen machst du mal das muttichen war immer nur zum helfen da wenn sie mal wieder in der nacht anrief weil sie so voll geladen war dass sie geister sah und die kissen sich bewegten bin ich sofort zu ihr gefahren
7110558 keiner hat sich um mich gek mmert ich bin immer bei allem schlecht weggekommen war nur der blitzableiter f r sie
7110559 irgendwann ist der punkt erreicht da kann man nicht mehr
7110560 ich w rde ihr gern helfen aber ich f hle mich nach all den jahren v llig hilflos

7110592 it is public policy of the state that any substantial sum of money paid to a minor because of a claim action or judgment in tort should be preserved for the benefit of the minor
7110593 if a minor or any other person in whose name a claim in tort is made or judgment in tort obtained on behalf of a minor recovers a net sum of 5 000 or more the person responsible for the payment of the money shall make payment by check made to the order of name of trustee trustee under title 13 of the estates and trusts article annotated code of maryland for name of minor minor
7110594 plain and unmistakable notice that the roadway over the track was not a public crossing
7110595 t he railroad is seen not to have given permission to the public to use the crossing nor passively to have acquiesced in such a use but to have objected in as obvious continuous practical and reasonable a manner as could be devised
7110596 maine law has also long recognized that a railroad crossing may be a private one in law yet a public crossing in fact
7110597 with respect to persons rightfully using a crossing the duty of the railroad company is similar to its duty as to users of public crossings and as to them it must exercise reasonable or ordinary care commensurate with the danger of the particular situation

7110602 as if she dimly suspected some hidden menace in them which she cant quite identify
7110603 were excited to see our tremendous growth continue this year by public reckoning this puts us on a par with many of the top ranked commercial cms vendors but more importantly we see our future in a significant new mid market enterprise segment thats beginning to see the value of supported open source and is questioning the license fee model
7110604 near term this new segment looks like setting itself at a total project spend including software acquisition development training and support of between 75 000 and 250 000 but whats really interesting is the shape of these customers because we take the license fee out of a customers budget at one end of the spending spectrum they tend to be firms punching above their weight and getting a highly specced system for less money whilst at the other end were seeing more and more large corporates that want to adjust their cost benefit model so that they spend high but get more value for money in terms of acquiring more project control and the freedom to highly customise the cms to their specific business requirements through a proportional spend on our development services
7110605 in other words we feel that the appetite for vanilla out of the box commercially licensed solutions is starting to fade at the top end whilst at the lower end we see people taking a more progressive and responsible view of cms software development and were winning big as both of these markets begin to fold into each other in traditional mid range price points
7110606 there was a minor impact therefore there can only be minor injury if any injury at all
7110607 maybe i could have swung a little higher but im not the kind of person to go down without swinging

7110610 we had opportunities and we let a couple go we had one or no blockers up and they were digging balls and transitioning and running balls down there were moments where we needed to be more aggressive and we werent we were hesitating a little bit
7110611 brazil played amazing you saw the defense the blocking the hits we fought hard we just didnt have enough
7110612 im happy with this thing around my neck right now and i will be forever

7110617 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her
7110618 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7110619 you cant put obama vp vetters eric holder and carolyn kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7110620 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about the position
7110621 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7110622 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7110623 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him

7110626 try and do this in a new way or try and see this in a different way today then i find that i do better because im not just resting on my laurels and doing the same things over and over i really do try and do things differently at every wedding thats another thing i love that every wedding and couple is so different and unique and so i really try and mold the way i shoot around who they are both separately and together so that when they get their pictures back they really think this is just so us
7110627 iya saya kira dengan adanya orang orang mempermasalahkan tentang foto sby hadir di pesta anak ayin itu ini sudah termasuk black campaign kampanye hitam
7110628 sebenarnya bagi saya tidak ada yang perlu dipermasalahkan dari foto itu karena pak sby adalah presiden seluruh rakyat indonesia dan siapa saja boleh mengundang seorang presiden untuk acara hajatan maupun perkawinan
7110629 beliau pun berhak untuk menghadiri acara acara undangan yang disampaikan kepada beliau tanpa harus bertanya apakah orang yang mengundang tersebut punya niat baik ataupun buruk
7110630 iya bisa saja itu bertujuan sebagai kampanye hitam kepada sby tetapi kami partai demokrat yakin bahwa rakyat sudah cerdas sehingga tidak akan terpengaruh oleh hal hal seperti itu
7110631 rakyat tahu itu sby adalah presiden yang jujur lurus dan tidak korupsi bahkan dengan gencar menggencet korupsi di indonesia
7110632 khusus dalam kasus ayin amat jelas bahwa hukum ditegakkan sama dengan kasus kasus hukum yang lain

7110636 i cant give you an answer i dont think anybody else can
7110637 i frankly cant understand why and i assume he must have some reasons that are unknown to me but hes thought all the issues out and weighed all the factors and decided someone else is the best
7110638 making it that much more challenging to break through to those voters

7110645 to understand just how unsettling russias invasion of georgia is to american foreign policy its useful to highlight a short exchange that senator mccains leading foreign policy advisor randy scheunemann had with a reporter from radio free europe in april
7110646 well i think first of all the administration has said very clearly and publicly that there will be no trade offs
7110647 trade offs like that are kind of a relic of a bygone era of power politics

7110690 we believe that such a raid could not have taken place unless mr maliki had at least prior knowledge of it
7110691 we want to have our cake and eat it too support maliki and the sons of iraq maliki wants to make that as hard for us as possible he wants us to choose him
7110692 what it looks like we are getting is a maliki government that wont behave itself and wants to crush the sons of iraq
7110693 just last week the prime minister gave his personal commitment to the program
7110694 they are well aware of the sacrifices the sons of iraq have made that they were a critical element in bringing the security situation under control and that it is in their strategic advantage to assimilate them peacefully and orderly into iraqi society

7110770 i tried to bait the guy a little bit but he did a great job and got underneath the ball
7110771 it was nice to see him regroup after the interception
7110772 to come out of the two minute situation with points is a positive that gave us a shot in the arm
7110773 we could have done a ton more we didnt go that deep in the playbook as long as we get into the rhythm and feel good about each other and what were doing the skys the limit
7110774 well probably start looking at cleveland probably more in depth now and start preparing for them
7110775 everything offensively went well passing game the run game just the way we moved the ball down the field
7110776 the truth is that joe robach is the single biggest barrier to womens health in rochester
7110777 hes taking a page from karl roves playbook and championing a lie robach is consistently anti choice and has stalled on allowing even the most basic measures such as age appropriate sex education from passing the senate
7110778 joe robach proudly accepted an award from a right wing anti choice organization and hes been their champion in albany ever since were talking about a guy who would not care if we go back to back alley abortions and the horrifying injuries and deaths that result the idea that robach would call himself a champion of womens health is just ludicrous
7110779 im proud of the fact that the majority of people in rochester and new york state favor reasonable measures such as the reproductive health act which codifies roe v wade in new york law and the healthy teens act which guarantees age appropriate sex education in public schools
7110780 republican joe robach boasts a flagrantly deceptive record on womens health and for him to publically stand behind women but yet ignore the issues important to them is an insult to their intelligence and a disservice to the voters in our community
7110781 my opponent joe robach stands firmly against womens right to choose and if it were dependent upon his misguided wisdom women in new york state would be stripped of these rights
7110782 before women had these rights communities across our state and nation were being devastated by a pandemic of underground abortions that left women who had no other choice risking serious injuries and on many occasion even death
7110783 with the ever increasing threats to roe v wade we can no longer trust that the sanctity of a womans rights to choose will be protected by the supreme court and given the track record of joe robach and his republican colleagues in albany we cannot afford to wait this one out
7110784 he assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
7110785 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7110786 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7110787 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7110788 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7110789 i mean you got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7110790 warren buffett is right i would eliminate the tax cut for the wealthy they didnt ask for it and as someone earlier said they dont need it
7110791 where we can america must why darfur because we can we should now those kids will be dead by the time the diplomacy is over
7110792 this administrations mishandling of the war in iraq may be the greatest foreign policy disaster of our times the next president is going to have to be prepared to immediately step in and act without hesitation to end our involvement in iraq
7110793 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is its awful hard with only a little bit of experience to have a clear sense of what you would do on the most critical issues facing us today
7110794 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain

7110860 se trata del yacimiento m s importante de la ciudad ya que hasta ahora hab an aparecido ejemplos puntuales de edificaciones fenicias pero nunca en una superficie tan extensa
7110861 concretamente han salido restos de estructuras murarias de habitaci n de modo que todos los materiales muebles son de viviendas tanto de interiores como de exteriores
7110862 est previsto que aparezcan estructuras del siglo viii en todo el solar como el muro que sali a la luz hace casi un a o aunque hay que esperar que concluya la excavaci n
7110863 es la primera vez que se ha hallado en la ciudad de c diz edificaciones del fenicio arcaico de gran porte tanto interior como exterior
7110864 hasta ahora a ade no se hab a descubierto estructuras de este tipo se hab an encontrado restos de modo aislado en la calle ancha c novas del castillo y en la casa del obispo pero nunca un hallazgo del tama o y continuidad estratigr fica del que se ha descubierto recientemente en el antiguo solar del c mico
7110865 es una gran satisfacci n desde el punto de vista arqueol gico porque este descubrimiento refleja el valor hist rico y art stico de la ciudad de c diz

7110868 a we called the restaurant multiple times each time we reached an answering machine and a message from a person purporting to be from the restaurant claiming that it was closed at the moment
7110869 b googling the restaurant turned up an actual address and located it on a map of milan
7110870 c the restaurant sent us a link to a website that listed its menu
7110871 this is a program that recognizes the efforts restaurants put into their wine lists
7110872 this gets down to what the wine spectator is all about its not exactly wine for dummies its more wine for the gullible
7110873 this gives the appearance of paying for advertising disguised as a contest
7110874 while osteria lintrepido may be the first to win an award of excellence for an imaginary restaurant
7110875 its unlikely that it was the first submission that didnt accurately reflect the restaurant
7110876 it could be in the air for 8 10 hours and theres potential harm if it is carrying a large amount of toxic material

7110884 our take home message today is that the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery wtc 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings it did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires it collapsed because fires similar to those experienced in other tall buildings burned in the absence of water supply to operate the sprinklers and burned beyond the ability of firefighters to control fires it fell because thermal expansion a phenomenon not considered in current building design practice caused a fire induced progressive collapse
7110885 found no evidence supporting the existence of a blast event
7110886 to apply thermite to a large steel column approximately 0 13 lb of thermite would be needed to heat and melt each pound of steel for a steel column that weighs approximately 1 000 lbs per foot at least 100 lbs of thermite would need to be placed around the column ignited and remain in contact with the vertical steel surface as the thermite reaction took place this is for one column presumably more than one column would have been prepared with thermite if this approach were to be used
7110887 unlikely that 100 lbs of thermite or more could have been carried into wtc 7 and placed around columns without being detected either prior to sept 11 or during that day

7110890 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
7110891 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
7110892 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
7110893 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
7110894 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well
7110895 shed put her purse in the trunk shed put her key in her pocket
7110896 so when we heard that her car was unlocked and purse was on the front with her coat we knew that shed been taken against her will or that something had happened because it was so out of character for her to leave her things like that
7110897 any possible fingerprints any hairs and fibers inside the car that would have been left by someone else besides debbie would have been vacuumed up in the cleaning
7110898 i thought it would be nice to have a photographic record of where ive been each day

7110902 where do you like to take the big red car do you go to the park
7110903 im not in control at all of what happens now
7110904 i will just go back to man united and keep my head down ive got used to that last season i wasnt involved much in the first half of the season there and i just tried to do the best i could you are not really in control of anything that goes on when you are under contract if any club wants to bid for me it is up to them and man united to decide what happens i dont know what is going to happen and i wont be knocking on sir alex fergusons door asking questions because he is in charge and im sure hell let me know whats happening
7110905 when roy keane says he wants you its a massive compliment
7110906 if he wanted to make this move permanent its something i would want to talk about playing in the premier league in games that matter is what its all about and what i want to be doing for a few years to come but nothing has been said at all by sunderland or manchester united about anything beyond this season i am really enjoying playing a full part in sunderlands season sometimes it seems a bit unreal that i am back at sunderland it didnt look like it was going to happen when the gaffer keane asked the question early in the season and united wanted me there but its great to be playing and testing myself in premier league games and its something i want a lot more of united is the club i support and to have the chance to make it there is still a great opportunity that no player surrenders easily but if i was ever going to leave manchester united sunderland would definitely be an option for me if they want me
7110907 i had a taste of premier league football with sunderland last season and it made me want more
7110908 i wanted to join sunderland this summer but sir alex ferguson made it clear that he needs me for cover at the back and has said that i will get games i think that if it gets to the stage where i am not getting enough games then he ferguson would allow me to leave in order for my career to progress i will continue to work hard at united and who knows what may happen in the future
7110909 i like its looks but at that price i can get something cheaper that does as much

7111079 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7111080 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7111081 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded

7111146 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7111147 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

7111176 confident that we can take this country in a new direction that we are ready to overcome the adversity of the last eight years that we wont just win this election in november well restore that fair shot at your dreams that is at the core of who joe biden and i are as people and what america is as a nation

7111180 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
7111181 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7111182 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7111183 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7111184 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7111185 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
7111186 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
7111187 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
7111188 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
7111189 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
7111190 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
7111191 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life
7111192 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
7111193 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7111194 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7111195 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7111196 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
7111197 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
7111198 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
7111199 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
7111200 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid

7111234 although plans were made during mr gambaris visit for him to meet with aung san suu kyi on august 20 refused to meet him
7111235 its a failure the prime minister is not a powerful person who can make a decision to revive the talks the worst thing is not being able to see aung san suu kyi
7111236 for gambari this time he will be very disappointed i think it will be very difficult for him to continue the mission

7111250 in my current work i use found objects as a starting point for conceptual works in ceramics old objects such as photographs pieces of clothing or ceramics have a way of directing our gaze to the past they are symbols of the life stories of those who used them from their markers i construct new stories memories play a pivotal role in defining who we are as humans in my work i wish to indicate the presence of time passed in the human mind as well as in the objects that surround us by giving the mute object a voice i imbue mass produced items with a narrative capacity
7111251 there is no longer any doubt on the foreign partner lufthansa is in pole position to sign an alliance
7111252 let me tell you something you humans most of you subscribe to this policy of an eye for an eye a life for a life which is known throughout the universe for its stupidity even your buddha and your christ have quite a different vision
7111253 it was like throwing a hotdog down a hallway hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
7111254 an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
7111255 to be angry about trifles is mean and childish to rage and be furious is brutish and to maintain perpetual wrath is akin to the practice and temper of devils but to prevent and suppress rising resentment is wise and glorious is manly and divine
7111256 to be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it
7111257 revenge is often like biting a dog because the dog bit you
7111258 holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else you are the one who gets burned

7111269 this is bulls t this is malarkey this is outrageous outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement

7111283 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7111284 das vorherige freibad das in den 1960er jahren errichtet wurde entsprach nicht mehr den hygienischen auflagen des landes
7111285 die vor kurzem fertig gestellte anlage hat eine gesamtwasserfl che von 1 220 quadratmeter wovon rund 660 quadratmeter auf den schwimmbereich sowie rund 560 quadratmeter auf regenerationsbereich und pflanzfilter entfallen
7111286 die projektierte technik einer wasseraufbereitungsanlage sorgt im hintergrund f r eine gleichbleibend hohe wasserqualit t
7111287 charakteristisch f r diese naturb der sind bepflanzte regenerationsbereiche die von den badeg sten nicht frequentiert werden d rfen
7111288 die trennung zwischen bade und regenerationsbereich ist an der wasseroberfl che durch schwimmbojen klar erkennbar der zugang zum badebereich erfolgt ber bekieste flachufer sowie ber einstiegsleitern und treppen
7111289 die wasserreinigung wird durch das wirkungsgef ge zwischen wasserpflanzen phyto und zooplankton sowie durch die umw lzung des teichwassers ber eine filteranlage erreicht
7111290 die naturschwimmb der wie jenes in t rnitz sind entsprechend dem b derhygienegesetz projektiert wie bei herk mmlichen freib dern wird auch bei diesen b dern die im gesetz als eigene kategorie kleinbadeteiche ausgewiesen sind gem den gesetzlichen vorgaben die wasserqualit t regelm ig berpr ft
7111291 die gesamte anlage ist mit teichbaufolie abgedichtet eine verbindung zum grundwasser besteht nicht
7111292 bei georadarmessungen wird mittels elektromagnetischer wellen der untergrund sondiert und so k nnen im erdreich verborgene strukturen wie mauern hohlr ume und bodenniveaus exakt nach gr e und tiefenlage erfasst werden
7111293 wir sind damit weltweit im einsatz und haben vermessungen in syrien gypten und in china durchgef hrt
7111294 das ergebnis ist ein zweidimensionales bild das ber eine landkarte gelegt zun chst umrisse sichtbar macht
7111295 mit der an der zamg entwickelten software kann man auch ein dreidimensionales bild herstellen
7111296 es lie en sich eindeutig die grundrisse einer reihe von geb uden erkennen bei dem komplex handelt es sich um eine typische villa rustica wie im r mischen reich ein landwirtschaftlicher betrieb aus einem hauptgeb ude und mehreren wirtschafts und nebengeb uden genannt wurde

7111300 die weibchen suchen sich wahrscheinlich deshalb ein gro es m nnchen weil es ein indikator f r gute gene bedeutet
7111301 gro e m nnchen haben allerdings nicht nur vorteile sie k nnen sich erst sp ter als ihre kleineren artgenossen fortpflanzen da sie erst nach abschluss ihres wachstums geschlechtsreif werden
7111302 aus diesem kr ftespiel der beiden gegens tzlich wirkenden mechanismen ergibt sich eine obere grenze f r das gr enwachstum der m nnchen
7111303 in zwei h hlen konnten wir populationen von zahnk rpflingen poecilia mexicana entdecken die sich seit unbestimmter zeit unabh ngig voneinander und von ihren oberirdischen vorfahren entwickelt haben

7111306 ich habe als teenager selbst erfahren wie es ist wenn man einen freund durch eine messersteicherei fast verliert und ich m chte verhindern dass noch mehr menschen die verheerenden folgen eines solches momentes durchmachen m ssen

7111311 es ist keine besonderheit in bernstein eingeschlossene insekten zu finden
7111312 eine rotalgenart bildet beispielsweise unter uv strahlung weniger rote lichtsammlerproteine und vermindert so die strahlungsabsorption die typische rote farbe der alge verschwindet dann und die pflanze bekommt wei e spitzen
7111313 normalerweise f ngt die ozonschicht einen gro teil der energiereichen kurzwelligen und sch dlichen uv strahlung der sonne ab

7111315 als u erst empfindlich erwiesen sich die sporen und keimzellen der algen die als einzeller im wasser treiben

7111319 es wird der radikalen opposition viele anh nger bringen und sie bei den wahlen im november pushen
7111320 diese ergebnisse bedeuten aber nicht dass die jugend weniger engagiert ist sondern eher dass sie sich nicht mehr mit den aktuellen strukturen identifizieren k nnen
7111321 viele jugendliche finden ber projekte vereine und gruppen ihren weg zu einer bestimmten politischen richtung und entschlie en sich erst dann einer partei beizutreten oder diese zu w hlen
7111322 gerade das engagement f r andere ist ein wichtiges thema f r jugendliche
7111323 auch diese treten heute nicht mehr in jungen jahren in parteien ein und bleiben 40 jahre lang parteisoldaten
7111324 jugendliche lernen nun einmal von ihren eltern und sehen sie als vorbilder an
7111325 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7111326 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7111327 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7111328 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7111329 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7111330 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7111331 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7111332 russia is clearly irritated at what it perceives as u s meddling in its neighborhood
7111333 it seems to be sending a message that if you play on our periphery well play in yours
7111334 we believe that such a raid could not have taken place unless mr maliki had at least prior knowledge of it
7111335 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7111336 the dream will endure as a legacy to the kennedys

7111338 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7111339 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7111340 while we deeply regret the circumstances surrounding indymacs failure we believe that there is insufficient evidence for us to investigate senator schumer at this time
7111341 i offered to pay for that one sign if they would agree to use gender neutral ones
7111342 the head of the work crew said he had gender neutral signs but refused to use them no charges were filed
7111343 there are quite a number of outstanding issues and therefore i encouraged the director general to convene senior officials sooner rather than later
7111344 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7111345 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7111346 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7111347 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7111348 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm

7111351 there is huge waste and loss of water through food that is produced since roughly 50 percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted

7111385 when i told her i was thinking about running for president she said she wanted to be there for me and boy was she ever
7111386 we traveled together she traveled on her own for me she did interviews she bucked up the staff and volunteers she danced on the stage when we won she was a real force of nature in our campaign
7111387 i knew there were people who were threatening her and refusing to talk to her
7111388 i would say to her you know you dont have to be out there for me
7111389 i saw that up close and personal during my campaign

7111393 we had everything in there we thought needed to be fixed
7111394 we gave felons back their rights we made election day a holiday we required a paper trail it was the way we thought elections should be run in our country

7111399 mark you men and brethren if by any fault of our own we ever fall into the hand of our enemies we need expect no mercy from them and if without fault we be delivered for a little season into their hands we have good reason to cry aloud to god for whoever may be spared men will forgive a thousand faults in others but they will magnify the most trivial offense in the true follower of jesus nor do i very much regret this let it be so and let it be a caution to us to walk very carefully before god in the land of the living you young members of the church who are often engaged in your worldly calling where a great number of persons are watching for your halting let this be a special reason to walk very humbly before god if you walk carelessly remember the lynx eyed world will soon see it and then with its hundred tongues it will soon spread the story the cross of christ is in itself an offense to the world let us take heed that we do not add any offense of our own it is to the jew a stumblingblock let us mind that we put no stumblingblocks where there are enough already to the greek it is foolishness let us not add our folly to give point to the scorn with which the worldly wise deride the gospel

7111418 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7111419 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7111420 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president
7111421 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7111422 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7111423 i think hes made a great pick with joe biden its not just foreign policy he has expertise in matters of the judiciary in his work for families
7111424 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7111425 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7111426 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7111427 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans
7111428 he has distinguished himself as a member of the united states senate and is an accomplished public servant i wish him well in his bid for higher office but remain a supporter and ally of sen john mccain
7111429 joe brings experience to baracks message of change together democrats are offering the american people change experience and good judgment a winning combination if there ever was one
7111430 joe biden has always been my first choice and i am pleased to learn he is sen obamas first choice as well i am proud of joe and believe his experience in the u s senate and as a national leader in foreign policy makes him an excellent candidate for vice president
7111431 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of

7111433 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory 32 and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left 34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world 35 for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in 36 naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me 37 then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink 38 when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee 39 or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee 40 and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me 41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels 42 for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink 43 i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not 44 then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee 45 then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me 46 and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal
7111434 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom 2 and five of them were wise and five were foolish 3 they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them 4 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps 5 while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept 6 and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him 7 then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps 8 and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out 9 but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves 10 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut 11 afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us 12 but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not 13 watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh

7111440 obamas in much better shape because he seems to have very good standing in the places that john kerry won and very good opportunities in a number of other states that look like they could go to the democrats
7111441 mccains fundamental problem is theres only one way home for him replicate the bush electoral victory state by state
7111442 the fundamental truth remains that this race is extremely tight mccain is in strong position in ohio and florida two states that have been critical for republican victories and hes better positioned today in michigan than the president was in either 2000 or 2004
7111443 it is tough to decide who to root for in this one
7111444 there was no reason for coal stocks to pull back
7111445 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7111446 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7111447 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7111448 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7111449 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7111450 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7111451 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7111452 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7111453 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time

7111456 1 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple 2 and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down 3 and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world 4 and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you 5 for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many 6 and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet 7 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places 8 all these are the beginning of sorrows 9 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake 10 and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another 11 and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold 13 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved 14 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come 15 when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand 16 then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains 17 let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house 18 neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes 19 and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days 20 but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day 21 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be 22 and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened 23 then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect 26 wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not 27 for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be 28 for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken 30 and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory 31 and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other 32 now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh 33 so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors 34 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled 35 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away 36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only 37 but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be 38 for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark 39 and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be 40 then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left 41 two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left 42 watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come 43 but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up 44 therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh 45 who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season 46 blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing 47 verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods 48 but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming 49 and shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken 50 the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of 51 and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
7111457 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
7111458 26 and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the son of man 27 they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded 29 but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all
7111459 37 but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be 38 for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark 39 and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be
7111460 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
7111461 35 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away

7111478 1 and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here 2 and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down 3 and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately 4 tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled 5 and jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you 6 for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many 7 and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet 8 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows 9 but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them 10 and the gospel must first be published among all nations 11 but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost 12 now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death 13 and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved 14 but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains 15 and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house 16 and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment 17 but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days 19 for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be 20 and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days 21 and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ or lo he is there believe him not 22 for false christs and false prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect 23 but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things 24 but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light 25 and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken 26 and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory 27 and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven 28 now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near 29 so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the doors 30 verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done 31 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away 32 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father 33 take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is 34 for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch 35 watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning 37 and what i say unto you i say unto all watch

7111480 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions 29 and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit
7111481 30 and i will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke 31 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come
7111482 32 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord hath said and in the remnant whom the lord shall call
7111483 16 but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel 17 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams 18 and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy 19 and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke 20 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
7111484 1 for behold in those days and in that time when i shall bring again the captivity of judah and jerusalem 2 i will also gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage israel whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my land
7111485 12 let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round about 13 put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come get you down for the press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is great 14 multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decision 15 the sun and the moon shall be darkened and the stars shall withdraw their shining 16 the lord also shall roar out of zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake but the lord will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of israel
7111486 36 verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation
7111487 it is impossible but that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come 2 it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones 3 take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him 4 and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him 5 and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith 6 and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you 7 but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat 8 and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink 9 doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him i trow not 10 so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do 11 and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee 12 and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off 13 and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us 14 and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed 15 and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god 16 and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan 17 and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine 18 there are not found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger 19 and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole 20 and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation 21 neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you 22 and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it 23 and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day 25 but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation 26 and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the son of man 27 they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded 29 but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed 31 in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back 33 whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it 34 i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left 35 two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left 36 two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left 37 and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered together
7111488 it is okay to make offerings in memory of me by throwing packaged rice into the river in the past the fish ate all the rice in the bamboo tubes therefore in the future please wrap them in chinaberry leaves and tie them with colored thread the fish will be afraid of these two things and will not eat your offerings

7111494 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
7111495 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory 32 and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left 34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world 35 for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in 36 naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me 37 then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink 38 when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee 39 or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee 40 and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me 41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels 42 for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink 43 i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not 44 then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee 45 then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me 46 and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal
7111496 inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of
7111497 12 wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks 13 for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man 14 and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peeped
7111498 24 therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people that dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt 25 for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction 26 and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt
7111499 6 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of gaza and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they carried away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to edom
7111500 9 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of tyrus and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they delivered up the whole captivity to edom and remembered not the brotherly covenant
7111501 11 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of edom and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he did pursue his brother with the sword and did cast off all pity and his anger did tear perpetually and he kept his wrath for ever
7111502 13 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of the children of ammon and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have ripped up the women with child of gilead that they might enlarge their border
7111503 1 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple 2 and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down 3 and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world 4 and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you 5 for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many 6 and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet 7 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places 9 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake 10 and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another 11 and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold 13 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved 14 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come 15 when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand 16 then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains 17 let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house 18 neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes 19 and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days 20 but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day 21 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be 22 and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened 23 then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect 26 wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not 27 for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be 28 for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken 30 and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory 31 and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other 32 now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh 33 so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors 34 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled 35 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away 36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only 37 but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be 38 for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark 39 and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be 40 then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left 41 two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left 42 watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come 43 but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up 44 therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh 45 who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season 46 blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing 47 verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods 48 but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming 49 and shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken 50 the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of 51 and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
7111504 41 the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here 42 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here
7111505 47 and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world 48 he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day
7111506 30 and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent 31 because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead
7111507 25 and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee
7111508 3 and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god 4 or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance 5 but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god 6 who will render to every man according to his deeds
7111509 27 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
7111510 5 who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead
7111511 9 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
7111512 7 but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men
7111513 17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world
7111514 6 and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day
7111515 45 then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me
7111516 as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren you did it to me
7111517 as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me
7111518 34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
7111519 the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
7111520 18 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
7111521 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
7111522 new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells
7111523 13 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
7111524 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea
7111525 14 for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come
7111526 12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name
7111527 2 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband 3 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god 4 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away 5 and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful 6 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son
7111528 the everlasting fire prepared for the devil 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever
7111529 14 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death
7111530 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
7111531 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
7111532 46 and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal
7111533 matthew 21 42 45 and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said 2 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son 3 and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come 4 again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage 5 but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise 6 and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them 7 but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city 8 then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy 9 go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage 10 so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests 11 and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment 12 and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless 13 then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city 8 then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy 9 go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage 2 his condemnation of the scribes and pharisees a who would fill up the measure of their fathers guilt woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous 30 and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets 31 wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets 32 fill ye up then the measure of your fathers
7111534 matthew 23 37 c whose house would be left desolate mt 23 38 39 behold your house is left unto you desolate 39 for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
7111535 14 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross 15 and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of them openly triumphing over them in it 16 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days 17 which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ
7111536 13 in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away
7111537 14 but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains
7111538 26 and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined 27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate
7111539 20 and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh
7111540 what sign will there be when these things are about to take place
7111541 16 then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains 17 let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house 18 neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes 19 and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days 20 but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day 21 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be 22 and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened
7111542 23 then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect 26 wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not 27 for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be 28 for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together
7111543 we know that during the afternoon ahmed and a group of friends were on the top floor of the block of flats they saw the group of six youths approach the estate on bikes at that point they decided to leave ahmed had become separated from his friends who went to the third floor
7111544 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille

7111634 es ging gut los weil wir heute vormittag mit balance und performance des autos sehr zufrieden waren wir f hlten uns gut vorbereitet und obwohl wir wussten dass es im qualifying sehr eng zugehen w rde waren wir sehr optimistisch q1 lief gut doch leider konnte ich in q2 nicht das optimum aus dem auto herausholen rgerlich
7111635 ich bin auch ziemlich entt uscht ich verpasste genau wie fernando den einzug in q3 der eigentlich m glich gewesen w re das potenzial war da wie wir in den freien trainings gezeigt haben
7111636 fernando du hast am donnerstag gesagt dass renault im qualifying konstant in die dritte oder vierte reihe fahren und um punkte k mpfen kann was war heute los
7111637 wir waren nicht schnell genug und haben es nicht ins q3 geschafft was unser hauptziel ist in den letzten neun oder zehn rennen waren wir immer in q3 aber heute waren wir nicht schnell genug beim n chsten mal m ssen wir besser sein aber jetzt schauen wir mal was morgen noch drin ist
7111638 es ging knapper zu als sonst denn ich war in q2 zw lfter und lag nur sechs zehntel hinter sebastian vettel der schnellster war es ist eigenartig dass sechs zehntel den unterschied zwischen platz eins und platz zw lf ausmachen es war unglaublich knapp da geht es eben schon um ein bis zwei zehntel manchmal hatten wir gl ck und sind um ein halbes zehntel ins q3 gekommen aber heute waren wir mal die pechv gel also m ssen wir sicherstellen dass wir gar nicht erst in die position kommen dass es um dieses halbe zehntel geht wir m ssen klar vor unseren konkurrenten liegen aber wir hatten daf r einfach nicht die pace
7111639 wir haben im gp2 rennen gesehen dass es leicht zu safety car phasen kommen kann wird es morgen auch um ein bisschen renngl ck gehen oder nur um die schiere pace
7111640 kann sein man wei nie die wahrscheinlichkeit f r eine safety car phase ist hier sehr hoch aber das wissen wir schon seit dem formel 3 rennen vor einem monat heute in der gp2 hat es wieder in der ersten runde einen zwischenfall und ein safety car gegeben morgen kann es also gut und gerne zu einer safety car phase kommen mit der strategie etwas auszurichten ist aber trotzdem schwierig denn man m sste ja genau eine runde vor dem safety car an die box kommen aber das wei man vorher nicht es ist unm glich einen unfall vorherzusagen also kann man nur das beste hoffen
7111641 hast du die aufkleber mit der spanischen nationalflagge f r die fahrerhelme organisiert
7111642 nein ich habe mich darum gek mmert dass wir die flaggen bekommen aber die entscheidung ist im fahrerbriefing gefallen ich wei nicht wer auf die idee gekommen ist aber auf einmal hatte ich den auftrag bis zum rennen 20 sticker mit der spanischen flagge zu organisieren
7111643 bist du gl cklich dar ber dass alle fahrer ihren respekt zeigen und die flaggen morgen tragen werden
7111644 ja das ist ein sch nes zeichen des respekts von allen von uns in diesen dingen sind wir uns immer einig morgen werden wir um 13 48 uhr auf der startaufstellung eine schweigeminute abhalten ich bin sehr stolz auf dieses verhalten von meinen kollegen
7111645 kannst du ein wort zu sebastian vettel sagen bist du berrascht ber seine performance
7111646 nicht wirklich wir wissen dass der red bull inzwischen eines der schnellsten autos ist sie haben ja den ferrari motor und dadurch hier einen vorteil wir haben heute zwei identische autos gesehen den red bull und den toro rosso eines fuhr um die pole position mit das andere schied in q1 beziehungsweise q2 aus ich denke toro rosso liegt seit ein paar rennen klar vor red bull heute war sebastian sehr gut aber auch s bastien bourdais kam ins q3 und fightete um positionen sobald toro rosso konkurrenzf hig ist wird sebastian ganz vorne mitfahren es war eine tolle leistung ein tolles wochenende morgen haben sie die chance auf viele punkte toro rosso ist jetzt ein weiterer gegner f r uns
7111647 unsere einzige chance ist eine aggressive strategie dann m ssen wir sehen was im rennen passiert ich habe schon bewiesen dass wm punkte auch von einem schlechteren startplatz aus erreichbar sind also gibt es keinen grund sich bescheidenere ziele zu setzen
7111648 wer auf einem stra enkurs von so weit hinten startet hat ein schwieriges rennen vor sich das wird uns morgen nicht anders gehen aber das team ist genau wie ich unver ndert motiviert im rennen kann alles passieren in den rennen der gp2 und der formel bmw musste das safety car ausr cken wir wollen vorbereitete sein falls das im grand prix auch passieren wird
7111649 all that we are is a result of what we have thought
7111650 what this power is i cannot say all i know is that it exists
7111651 imagination is everything it is the preview of lifes coming attractions
7111652 whatever the mind of man can conceive it can achieve
7111653 i am happy with this especially as i saw in the match today certain things that we worked on in the previous weeks
7111654 we were changing a lot of positions in attack and that can make it difficult for other teams we played pretty dominant football and that is what our intention is
7111655 sir i just received word from the estate that a large army had formed and was rallying to strike at the estate
7111656 town walls as high as the capitol sir 30 sections of phalanx 3 sections of steam giants and 20 or so sections of archers
7111657 could not say they are certainly rallying to the idea of it sir
7111658 the men are worried master youve been barely alive these past few nights
7111659 sit eat with me i have work for you today and i want to be certain you are well fed and comfortable
7111660 there is an alliance a mighty alliance of large empires they control entire strings of islands 3 4 perhaps more all in close proximity to one another well defended find this string of islands and i believe youll find a weakness amongst these mighty empires one that we can exploit to achieve wealth weve never before seen
7111661 sir weve infiltrated a particular empire in this alliance the wealthiest one of them all and in fact their emperor appears to be on holiday visiting other empires they are without leadership each city is defended by a mere 5 ballista ships and 2 ram ships sir and the cities have maybe 2 dozen groups of units mostly phalanxes and archers in each but the alliance is powerful sir we need to sail quietly to avoid detection and when their emperor returns we may have ourselves outnumbered
7111662 85 isnt 100 is it it isnt even 95 is it youre telling me that you have no intelligence because you were too afraid to lose the lives of a few dozen spies
7111663 new recruits who appear to not wish to die today send them to the city of furlong immediately
7111664 no them them alone pillage or die but be sure to return at least one man with a report of their forces
7111665 why have you sent another fleet to pillage us have you not gained enough
7111666 not enough to cover the losses incurred tell your emperor that ah nevermind guards toss it
7111667 welcome to the heart of the elders alliance our emperor is traveling as youve no doubt noticed your brand of diplomacy is fascinating quite daring of you to visit is it not do you not fear the repercussions the elders are peaceful but many and do not take well to this sort of diplomacy certainly friendly trading arrangements would have been more cautious
7111668 cautious would be to hold your tongue in my presence i have an entire palace wing dedicated to the scalps of diplomats foreign and domestic should your alliance seek retribution for my actions theyll find little reward in it and much death that is if your traveling emperor returns
7111669 hold my tongue fool the elders will bury you for this
7111670 sir you have broken a peace treaty held by our alliance by dispatching those men your chief of intelligence should have consulted me
7111671 sir that alliance peace treaty the one we had nearly broken some time ago
7111672 it is no longer we are free to engage members of that alliance sir
7111673 and what of the intelligence it had better be good as so far this could have waited another hour yes
7111674 yes sir of course one target in particular has a warehouse equal to the size of your warehouse here in the capital sir and it is full problem is it is heavily guarded and their emperor has long been away the empire in question could fade into anarchy at any moment and the warehouse could be breached
7111675 ahh the cowardly soldier turned treacherous murderer turned mighty emperor quite the colony you have here this governors residence is become quite the palace
7111676 i roll out the red carpet for you celebrate the arrival of my kin and you insult me in my own home i see the time for pleasantries is over what have you for me
7111677 our leader sees your wealth as an extension of his own and intends fully to ensure you see it as such as well your empire is his and he intends for me to be your overseer you are to pay taxes to him in the form of 30 percent of all your revenues this might slow down your expansion plans but surely it is in your best interest of course
7111678 hes waiting in your harbor actually go have a look
7111679 what say you sir shall i collect the taxes now or in the morning
7111680 send an enjoy to the capital now i want my navy here right away
7111681 general tell me of the garrison what are the strengths
7111682 sir we are units of phalanx deep with 10 units of archers for support and some odd swordsmen units
7111683 afraid so sir but they are as well trained as any in your navy
7111684 send a dispatch to our sulfur colony have them coordinate the arrival or defensive land unit reinforcements with the arrival of our ships from the capital have them dispatch a defensive naval force to the capital immediately in case the enemy decides to strike there while the capital navy sails here start recruiting as fast as our barracks can in every colony on the island and i want every shipyard building defensive ships save the sulfur colony have them focus on offensive construction for retaliation send these envoys now
7111685 what the hell do i care how is that something youd interrupt me for
7111686 sir we sit in the soft underbelly of these alliances most of their stronger members are far off and their weaker ones surround us clearly this is an opportunity to profit greatly on the situation but also an opportunity to do so with some degree of just cause
7111687 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government
7111688 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time

7111750 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
7111751 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
7111752 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
7111753 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
7111754 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
7111755 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life
7111756 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today
7111757 the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race

7111759 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon

7111833 have you forgotten that marx considered religion to be the opium of the people
7111834 it is the bourgeoisie which has turned religion into an opium of the people by preaching a god lord of the heavens only while taking possession of the earth for itself
7111835 christs redemptive work while essentially concerned with the salvation of men includes also the renewal of the whole temporal order hence the mission of the church is not only to bring the message and grace of christ to men but also to penetrate and perfect the temporal order with the spirit of the gospel in fulfilling this mission of the church the christian laity exercise their apostolate both in the church and in the world in both the spiritual and the temporal orders these orders although distinct are so connected in the singular plan of god that he himself intends to raise up the whole world again in christ and to make it a new creation initially on earth and completely on the last day
7111836 human beings are called to meet the lord insofar as they constitute a community a people

7111844 when health care providers tell patients to watch their carbs eat more fiber or to avoid saturated fats most people dont know where to start
7111845 myfoodadvisor takes the guesswork out of that this tool appeals to so many looking for nutrition information people with diabetes because of the consistent portions of carbohydrates and proteins people with or at risk for heart disease because of the option to search by fiber sodium and saturated fats and people with kidney disease because potassium and phosphorous information is included which is not listed on standard nutrition labels
7111846 sometimes the low fat version of our favorite foods contains more sugar or sodium than the regular version or the sugar free contains more trans and saturated fat
7111847 it is a good idea to have the total picture before making a decision at the grocery store
7111848 lets say for example you are trying to watch the amount of carbohydrates you eat but also trying to increase your fiber intake
7111849 you can search for recipes that meet both of those needs
7111850 if one person in the family has type 2 diabetes or heart disease chances are there are others around the dinner table who could be at risk as well

7111987 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today
7111988 the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race
7111989 we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
7111990 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon

7112038 make love your aim and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts especially that you may prophesy
7112039 the manifestation of the spirit is given to everyone for profit
7112040 something exceptional done at a time snatched with difficulty from other activities but should become a habit part of the normal rhythm of our lives so that its place is never questioned even for a single day
7112041 a quarter of an hour is the absolute minimum and anyone who is able should not hesitate to spend an hour on prayer or even more every day
7112042 this is all the more important because experience shows that it is often in the last five minutes that our lord visits us and blesses us after we have spent all the rest of the time working without catching anything like st peter at his fishing
7112043 t here should also be a place for praying in every home many families today feel the need to reserve a room or a corner of a room as a kind of oratory
7112044 mental prayer can be done sitting kneeling face down on the floor or even standing up or lying in bed
7112045 sometimes when we are tempted to be lazy a physical attitude that better expresses our search for and desire for god kneeling on a prie dieu or kneeler for instance with hands open will enable us to focus on god
7112046 should become a daily event as vital to us as the basic rhythms of existence mental prayer should become the breathing of our souls
7112047 sometimes god wounds us more effectively by leaving us in our wretchedness than by healing us of it
7112048 deep level of our being so that we cannot do without him any more
7112049 my grace is sufficient for you because my power is shown forth in weakness
7112050 how very true the thorn put us on our knees we then discover that that is not a bad place to be our poverty taught us how to pray with a more humble and sincere heart

7112066 weapon x first class follows wolverine and charles xavier in their search to unlock the memories buried deep within logans fractured psyche
7112067 the series takes place a short while after wolverine joined the x men a time when much of his past was still a mystery even to wolverine himself
7112068 weapon x first class uses the original story as a foundation and explores entirely new areas of that chapter in wolverines life

7112081 obviously weve always thought of him as a starter and thats how i still think of him
7112082 the thing is that theres not a lot of time to build him up so we might have to be creative how we build him up we havent gotten much past saturday because now at this point you just take it day by day were not exactly sure how were going to do it were just going to make sure hes healthy and try to get him back to where he can be successful

7112094 a lot of guys have injuries and they approach the redshirt differently

7112096 i think thats what billy did hes a little bit stronger his arm is stronger he was in every meeting last year so it gave him another year to learn the offense and see defenses and try to make himself better
7112097 it feels awesome but im just glad that i was able to prove to the coaches myself and my teammates that ive earned the spot again

7112129 congress holds first hearing on virtual worlds linden lab ceo philip rosedale testifies virtually blind
7112130 such a decision as slashdot alerts us that beyond just seeking an injunction against the software blizzard is specifically seeking

7112132 down mdys glider was not included in the summary judgment blizzard has since filed a motion asking for a permanent injunction
7112133 but this is precisely the tragic situation our country faces today when one strays from the narrow path of non racialism one inexorably moves into the camp of ethnic nationalism or one is pulled in when this happens we lose sight of what is happening to all of us because we see only what happens to us in our own little camp to those who look like us think like us talk like us
7112134 that is why before we know it we begin to accuse and slander to maim and kill in a xenophobic frenzy so utterly strange to the deepest heart of our people
7112135 that is why throughout south africas painfully slow transformation processes some afrikaners find refuge in a new afrikaner nationalism
7112136 that is why there is a new movement for coloured people they do not see that if what happened in south africa since 1994 is a betrayal it is a betrayal not of coloured people but of all marginalised all poor all destitute people
7112137 the problems besetting the coloured communities are problems besetting all poor communities right across the length and breadth of this land
7112138 that is why there are those who call themselves african to the exclusion of all other africans including the sons and daughters of the khoi and the san who were the first to live in this continent and who gave birth to the human race and of all those white brothers and sisters whose roots are planted in the soil of africa who share the lot and the dreams of this continent who want to be known by no other name than african
7112139 that is why even the anc has succumbed to the subtle but pernicious temptations of ethnic thinking has brought back the language of ethnicity into the speech of the movement and has as government brought back the hated system of racial categorisation
7112140 that is why today everywhere we look it takes but the merest provocation for the ghosts of racism to rise and haunt us because we have buried them in graves too shallow and too close to home
7112141 our problem is a problem of betrayal of the poor of a loss of faith in the people of a loss of vision for the nation it is a problem of disconnectedness with the people of greed and hunger for power of self deceit and mindless arrogance
7112142 but what we hear now despite all the justifications is not a willingness to die for the sake of others but a desire to kill for a cause that is not necessary to kill for and that jacob zuma himself i am sure would not want anybody to die for
7112143 our people are not looking for the politics of instant gratification and entitlement they are longing for the politics of justice they are not looking for the politics of self satisfaction and self aggrandisement they are searching for the politics of hope
7112144 though many black youths are idealistic and committed to south africa they also harbour resentment which if left unchallenged could lead to racial attacks
7112145 through many black youths are idealistic and committed to south africa they also harbour resentment which if left unchallenged and how it shouldnt could lead to racial attacks
7112146 33 of my readers are racist makes for a better title i apologize for offending you
7112147 your people are not looking for the politics of instant gratification and entitlement they are longing for the politics of justice
7112148 whats that got to do with apartheid are they getting the blame for that too
7112149 who can believe sa stats anyway i speak from personal experience where black friends have left and they were highly qualified professionals
7112150 una mente vivace e tranquilla pu essere soddisfatta anche senza vedere nulla e non vede nulla che non le piaccia
7112151 two hundred pelicans fly over the stella maris lighthouse slowly beating their wings in the days thick air
7112152 suddenly their line is broken the terrifying whirling helicopter scatters their feathers to the winds
7112153 how many times have i asked you not to call me that jordyn

7112158 authorities in building control in singapore do not need to catch us
7112159 it did not happen overnight and it took a crisis to build this trust
7112160 i think the brazilian society needs to understand once and for all that we are only going to be able to truly fight corruption once the civil society with the instruments made available can act as a watch dog
7112161 do you remember that ambush in the summer of 69
7112162 i was evacuated too because of a light wound in my back from one of those treacherous ricochets off the hostile basalt
7112163 slowly and with emphasis i read the names of the boys lying on meinside the evacuation carrier
7112164 motke i vowed to myself between bonejarring jolts of the galloping carrier motke if you manage to get out of here in one piece if you make it to the landing zone at kuneitra safe and sound if you survive the flight to the hospital youll never comeback
7112165 so while we lay on the floor of the carrier in a sweating bleeding pile of wounded men we swore one another solemn inviolable oaths
7112166 where am i and where is the flak jacket around me
7112167 why was i punished why were the guys punished who thehell is it who decides wholl be wounded what would have happened if i had dawdled on my final leave as my wife had begged me andnot hurried off to join the patrol that was hit
7112168 as you can see you understand how it is i recovered quicklyenough from my wound
7112169 its unbelievable how much suffering there is in the world
7112170 after my wound at ufana when i knew that i hadnt been badlyhurt and would soon recover and might even make something out ofit i was filled with a childish desire to contemplate everythingas a reporter would
7112171 wrap myself in a soft flak jacket for the rest of my life
7112172 zelda my child dont try to go out dont rebel against us youre well off with us do you only know what they do to people like you they make them work till exhaust they practice experiment on them the other ones they kill and burn them
7112173 i am sorry to bother you but i need to ask you to come with me
7112174 my sister has been quite sad in recent weeks her situation deteriorated until she would hardly come out of her bedroom she doesnt want to see anyone except me not even my parents she hardly eats
7112175 no thank you father i am worried we all are i thought you might be able to help please come with me to see her would you mind father
7112176 i spoke with my sister before i went to see you father
7112177 dear deborah could you tell me precisely what you feel
7112178 are you able to imagine yourself trying to come out of that big black hole
7112179 trying to imagine that is an impossible feat let alone seeing myself doing that
7112180 what about leaving your room and going downstairs to the kitchen could you imagine yourself doing it
7112181 thinking about it is like imagining myself swimming across an ocean
7112182 i dont wish to see anyone i find i am overwhelmed by the presence of people i feel almost suffocated
7112183 be candid deborah you may as i am about to leave
7112184 so i tell you what if you wish i could come back tomorrow and stay with you for a short while we can continue talking for my part i would be glad to do that
7112185 it has always been that way but i will pay them back as they are younger than me they have always chosen the easy way
7112186 we are all mortal sis at least he saw life may god give us strength to reach his ripe old age
7112187 he has passed away but we who still live lets get to work i am here anyway
7112188 lets do it now it is much better to settle this down than drag the issue to the court
7112189 you sis have a big house in the center of sofia which you inherited from your husband let burian and i divide the patrimony
7112190 dont even think about it i took care of him i was by his side whenever he was ill and even when he had caught a slight cold especially now as he got that brain stroke both you and burian could never be taken seriously you have always been far at the seaside and he has been wasting his time with his friends
7112191 who me how dare you say that dad died lonely and wanted to see none of you you babblers you dont practice what you preach and now you act like vultures i will take the ground floor he pledged it to me to turn it into a studio
7112192 much good may it do you you will drink it away anyway lets remise him the ground floor sis and each of us will take a floor we will toss up for the furniture it is antique and i have already figured out how it would match the one i have at home it might be used to furnish our villa as well
7112193 we have an agreement sis havent we no more than tomorrow we should go to a notary while burian is still unaware of situation
7112194 shes a friend who works as an editor at one of the publishing houses
7112195 come on tzila have coffee with us in the cafeteria you wont be sorry
7112196 sit down sit down after the distilled wisdom of professor rosenfeld everyone needs to unwind dont be like all those kibbutzniks always hurrying for the last bus with a glance at their watches and apologizing that they havent the time to stay
7112197 we leave each friday night to sleep at a new settlement
7112198 will someday lead us to tragedy and drown us in rivers and rivers of blood the sleeping bags are only new symbols for an old world of sanctified greed
7112199 why havent you taken a room in the dormitories or near the university
7112200 i dont need any help and please dont go to any trouble anyway i cant stay in the city
7112201 are you going back to your kibbutz in the north what time do you get home and how do you travel at night alone all the way every week now thats really crazy
7112202 i have a little girl who waits up for me at home every night
7112203 no that is impossible i live alone with my child and i have to get back
7112204 if you did make it a habit with us its a weekly meeting well start with coffee with the gang and see how it goes
7112205 but the highlight comes later when the professor offers personal comments straight from the heart to his favorite students come on well tag along with them one time youll see itll be interesting
7112206 and if it gets late and you cant make it home tonight ill take care of you
7112207 id be happy to share my room in the dormitories with you
7112208 why dont we leave our bookbags at the coat racks
7112209 it was as though they knew how every penny i save goes to building a basic library in judaism and how thirsty i get on these insane bus rides
7112210 for us to start sharing some of the riches we have stored up over the school year there are others less fortunate than we even some who know none of the joy of judaism and the crowning glories of israel he who is wealthy
7112211 must know that the essence of all learning is simply this give of yourself to others
7112212 heres the public phone do you see it and here to the right is the synagogue at the top of the stairs is the roof a huge cracked spread of tar and plaster and pigeon droppings although the girls complain that its unpleasant to sunbathe up there in the mess it does afford a wonderful view of the mountains south of the city mt gila the monastery below it and bethlehem in the distance no wait a minute
7112213 take a seat in this old armchair and ill put some tea on to boil you see the room may be small but it has everything a sink a toilet and an electric kettle i dont have to run for the bus at night like a madman now sit down and tell me everything how he went off to war and what happened to him before he came back im beginning to understand some things for myself like your jewish studies and why you have to travel while your daughter stays home alone
7112214 an excellent interviewer whose programs were gripping interesting and very helpful for listeners to get to know the poetry
7112215 listen dont get upset theyre saying here that youve written a moving book of poems
7112216 on the second floor its an old building in one of the small streets turning off ibn gvirol and the door
7112217 we can start in a minute would you like some coffee or tea maybe a roll
7112218 never mind rami will go down to the corner store and get some fresh rolls
7112219 excellent poems about memory but dont expect it to sell and dont think anyone is going to take note of it and recognize your talent youll see youre going to be very disappointed
7112220 what are you so angry about why are you so hostile all im doing is interviewing you about a new book of poems your first book of verse
7112221 i saw too many young lads piled up at casualty clearing stations i saw too many handsome soldiers strewn on the ground in the maneuvers of that damn war
7112222 maybe we can do something with it this anger of yours will eat you up you had better be careful in your place i would do something about it
7112223 no one can read your poems better than you can
7112224 ah thats it thats exactly the problem there will be no broadcast
7112225 i listened to the partial recording that we made and its really good and your reading of the poems is wonderful however the interview will not be broadcast the station manager has vetoed it
7112226 what did i say what did i say that had to be vetoed
7112227 thats just the problem the poems you read came out really good ill see that you get a tape with the poems make sure you keep them you may find a use for them some time a wonderful reading really touching poems about memories some of them may be the best war poems i have read recently
7112228 thats what they thought the people at the station who heard it this is hardly the time to be broadcasting defeatist talk on an army radio station such an interview could lower the morale of the listeners thats what they say at the station we should keep it till better times
7112229 im really sorry its a pity your book will be forgotten perhaps we can meet again after you publish your next book of verse
7112230 youre all crooks this is one big racket its a celebration of exploitation and theft the swindling of poets

7112247 whoa fred settle down take it easy i was just tryin to say that chromium sea could maybe be a start to a new avenue for our lives yeah mine included and i was only talking to you about whats driving me there to this strange funky ass place for wierdos because im a little nervous thats all man dont you ever lighten up dont you ever just talk with anyone this aint a test theres no right or wrong answers i was just sitting here with a drink in my fist blowing off some steam and telling you whats in my head is this how you were with georgia too cause if it was its no wonder she left you
7112248 yeah well i guess you may be on to something there whatever its ancient history now but jack ive got to tell you i really dont wonder much about anything anymore
7112249 wings are illusion the power to soar resides in the shadows of the self
7112250 homogeniety is where the journey ends in its beginning be immortal seek only the road not the destination
7112251 sleepless i looked into a mirror that showed no light and i saw the reality of dreaming
7112252 radical thought births a new paradigm each overlaid atop the one that came before build a stairway to infinity
7112253 conformity of thought is tyranny revolution is already yours if you but imagine it
7112254 the single minded arrogance of material wealth is exceeded only by its rapacious hunger to despoil fuckage is inevitable
7112255 dude this squatting alone in the dark among the weeds is not how i imagined youd be spending your first night here in the electric carnival wazzup with you you alright
7112256 im fine just fine jack waiting for someone is all dont worry theyll be back shortly
7112257 waiting yeah its that new girl you met huh miranda you sure she hasnt stood you up cause i can share
7112258 the fuckage is complete and everlasting and comes in ways you can never expect hope is madness
7112259 this is a new car but truthfully i would rather write a book of poetry than write a new car buy a new car for it is only matter you understand and matter goes it conquers you controls you
7112260 just like har esh says menashe har esh in his book home and so on without end talking in words i couldnt understand years later i heard about the book from my girlfriend michelle when i was fifteen
7112261 twenty or twenty five years ago its hard to say with the new calendar he disappeared
7112262 without a doubt he deeply suffered from lack of literary success since he had invested all his resources in that and the responses were so minimal
7112263 oh yes youre right they added a year so it is 66
7112264 he had a friend who is still living hes a lecturer at the university goldstein hes really the only one i think that teaches a course about him
7112265 you must have come to talk with me about an important subject no one ever asked me about him what brings you to ask about menashe har esh this book is essentially fictitious it has not been written
7112266 he was my good friend and a very talented author
7112267 i heard that baruch goldstein was a criminal that hed go into arab homes and murder the husband then rape the wife sort of a jessie james of the wild east i dont know whats true and whats not i dont know anything about this baruch goldstein and i have no interest in him
7112268 youknowwho yaacovrazinwas he was a very wise man from morrocco who was murdered by arabs in the uprisings of tel aviv
7112269 i heard about it but i dont like crowds we went into a house without electricity or television in the corner of the room sat a child of about twelve years old smiled at me and sang the book was completely stuck together perhaps from the heavy humidity that filled the house
7112270 your honor the judge my apologies your honor i never said that i agree with murder however i am happy that this individual was murdered i am happy since i didnt like him
7112271 baruch goldstein the wicked beastly one who makes generations of students crazy and pushes them to go from judaism to the the state religion state religion we didnt expect that even in the holy writings
7112272 the university is closing the university is closing down because of a chronic lack of funds i did research work on it ten years ago maybe you can find it in the library
7112273 it means that for each book there is one reader i dont know how many copies were printed
7112274 always when you look for something look for the woman beyond the matter
7112275 think about it maybe there are other reasons for your search it isnt enough that your father showed it to you when you were five the editor said to me
7112276 this is a good article but there are many mistakes
7112277 i dont know its as if there is no reality as if everything happens yet nothing happens you dont know who you will meet
7112278 no i mean menashe har eshs woman and menashe har esh is he still alive
7112279 i think that hes still living but i dont know how to find him and his book one more week there and ill go crazy if i dont believe that a person can leave after a month
7112280 newspapers are closing all the time this is the best paper in modiin they offered him management of a milk marketing company his wife and mother cried and cried
7112281 i am going to walk a little around mt har afat on the way to the mountain david passed the second hand book store of david fogel a sort of kind grandfather who knew how to talk about books with everyone
7112282 here look on page 110 wuld is written instead of would
7112283 this book is based on the theory of chaos a somewhat primitive theory concerning the relationship between distant events that was widely accepted fifty or sixty years ago a rather humorous theory that essentially
7112284 it was also theological there was something about the first temple it was written in code like nostradamus
7112285 its a very strange book a very few copies were printed
7112286 yes because at the end the reader is asked to burn it this really was convincing so i burnt it but even if i wasnt convinced in the second book there were two pages of curses directed to the person who doesnt burn it
7112287 you can say why yes but it seems better to believe in god
7112288 lets leave it for now youll never be a theologian
7112289 and puts it in a used books store maybe sells it maybe he himself sells it
7112290 ashkelon was destroyed from an earth accident an earthquake caused by underground vehicles a gigantic computer that lost its way called the perpetual seeker a cute name for a computer
7112291 sort of a little ill tell you i saw it in french and in english but not in hebrew in french its called
7112292 what happened to this way of counting to the christians
7112293 once i flew there in a helicopter of that kind and it wasnt a pleasant experience
7112294 be careful this adulteress will take you astray in the evening after i had fallen asleep she asked a question about the book on the supernet and when i awoke there were a few answers which were no different from those i had received up until now except for one
7112295 hello my name is david koresh and i am looking for your book because i am writing an article for the modiin paper
7112296 i suggest you not ask questions like that if you dont want me to disappear from the line forever how is it that you didnt write it far from mars you are also the same distance from mars and also from jupiter if you dont mind
7112297 no my books did succeed there was even one reader who understood it and this is great success in todays world who has time to read a book with supernet with all the home computers and a book in hard cover that is hard to digest as a hard boiled egg
7112298 i certainly am lost the more i look for your book the more lost i am
7112299 but in any event i could continue asking questions maybe you would benefit from it
7112300 everyone looks for the answer but no one knows the question
7112301 these homeopaths cause harm to our right to prevent our own pain even if it brings about a less difficult death
7112302 doesnt matter what bothers me in this article is that we are left without home and without menashe har esh maybe you should go to austin to look for him
7112303 do you know what leave it alone maybe you should go to live in jerusalem and be our correspondent there for a year or so write a few in depth articles my wife didnt agree however i knew that i would go
7112304 the last thing that my grandfather told me i was thirteen years old
7112305 it was about the housekeeper he had in morocco her name was fatima she was very loyal to him and his younger brothers he always remembered her
7112306 this is a good reason to go to jerusalem endanger your young family and our future
7112307 yes sane you are crazy to go to a place where theres a synagogue on every corner a church or a mosque where people get killed everyday
7112308 my grandfather told me that in morocco people werent killed because of their religion and thats a fanatical arab moslem country
7112309 david you didnt just leave modiin you also left me in your thoughts you left me some time ago
7112310 maybe i am moving away from you but i feel that youll come after me its just a matter of time
7112311 i really did write it did i sleep for so long i looked at my hands which always indicate age
7112312 to my friend david koresh without you this book would not have been published

7112317 ik lag dus heerlijk in het zonnetje toen dat wijf weer voor mijn verblijf stond kijk normaal houd ik wel van een teefje dat mijn aadacht wil maar van 57 jarige mensen ben ik dus niet gediend ik heb dus wel een reputatie hoog te houden
7112318 maar ja die vrijdag ging ze dus iets te ver plotseling gingen er een paar kleine ventjes stenen naar mijn kop gooien ik had al vaker bij de directie aangekaart dat er eens gesproken moest worden over een dierentuinwet maar ja veel gelul in de politiek maar voorlopig blijft dat stenen gooien maar doorgaan nou zag ik dus ook nog eens dat wijf weer naar me lachen en dat was de spreekwoordelijke druppel
7112319 ja leuk zon greppel maar ik had allang door dat ik daar wel overheen zou komen luister die verzorgers zijn allemaal toffe peren snijden je appeltjes wassen wat bananen dus ik blijf al jaren netjes op dat eiland zitten maar ja feyenoord had ook al een kutseizoen dus ik was net wat geprikkelder dan normaal en als je dan hoort dat ze co adriaanse willen halen zon griet je lastig blijft vallen die dierentuinwet op zich laat wachten en van die koters stenen gooien dan ga je je bent een rotterdamse zilverrug of niet
7112320 ernstig ernstig kijk zij wil aandacht van een gorilla dan geef je die op een gorillawijze en dan is het weer niet goed toen ik doorhad dat ze niet zo goed reageerde op mijn antwoord ben ik netjes van haar afgestapt en naar de kantine gelopen om een pilsje te drinken toen ik daar aankwam bleek dat ze de tap hadden dichtgegooid ja dan breekt er echt iets
7112321 ook weer zon reactie als ze me nou netjes hadden gevraagd of ik terug naar dat eiland had willen lopen had ik dat ook wel gedaan nee hoor schieten ze gelijk weer zon pijl in je reet
7112322 luister ik ben helemaal niet moeilijk maar je moet goed begrijpen eigenlijk hoor ik in het regenwoud in afrika te wonen daar heerst een heel andere cultuur dat moet je respecteren maar goed ik ben redelijk geintegreerd maar dat vrouwen zo respectloos met je omgaan doet pijn heel veel pijn ik overweeg dan ook een flinke claim in te dienen voor opgelopen emotionele schade
7112323 ja ook hen neem ik het een en ander kwalijk ik vind dat ze best een limiet mogen stellen op de kwantiteit en kwaliteit van de bezoekers die langskomen het is toch van de zotte dat sommige mensen iedere dag langskomen op den duur word je daar toch knettergek van het is dat mijn schoonmoeder nog ergens in kameroen door de bossen rent maar voor je het weet staat die hier ook voor de deur
7112324 ja zij ook het is al geen lolletje om hier te zitten in dat druilerige rotterdam maar dat wanbeleid in de kuip is ook niet normaal dat maakt de zondag als het al drukker in de diergaarde niet leuker steeds meer feyenoorders gaan op zondag liever naar blijgaarde dan naar de kuip bedankt en dan mag ik wel uit het regenwoud komen van bosz houd ik niet

7112335 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7112336 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7112337 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7112338 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7112339 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7112340 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7112341 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7112342 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7112343 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7112344 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7112345 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7112346 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
7112347 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7112348 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7112349 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7112350 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience

7112354 it will help both the nato alliance and respond to the coming threats
7112355 missile defense of course is aimed at no one it is in our defense that we do this
7112356 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
7112357 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
7112358 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7112359 senator bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7112360 his working across the aisle guaranteed that the kerry smith provision was adopted
7112361 if the support senator biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that senator obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser
7112362 with the selection of senator biden democrats now have a national ticket that is ready to lead our party to victory this november
7112363 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7112364 the law is the law and i do not believe its going to be changed and its not going to be changed by me and you can keep coming to town hall meetings if you want to and ask this question in different ways and i will be glad to respond in the same way
7112365 i dont think that should be a top priority of us raiding people who are using medical marijuana with all the things weve got to worry about and our justice department should be doing that probably shouldnt be a high priority

7112374 lagi pula perkembangan kekebalan terhadap dua obat anti influenza yang disetujui oseltamivir tamiflu r dan zanamivir relenza r dan juga kurangnya vaksin yang memadai telah meningkatkan perlunya mengembangkan obat obat anti virus baru
7112375 karenanya saya ingin dilibatkan dalam tahap penelitian praklinis calon obat anti virus inovatif ini dan berharap melanjutkan kerjasama sukses kami dengan canopus biopharma di bidang ini
7112376 dosis statin yang lebih tinggi dari dosis yang digunakan dalam kajian ini kemungkinan dapat menghasilkan kemanjuran yang jauh lebih besar statc tm tampaknya juga lebih efektif apabila diberikan dalam upaya pencegahan
7112377 kami juga termotivasi dalam membandingkan potensi senyawa ini dengan obat obat anti influenza lain yang tersedia saat ini jelas terdapat kebutuhan signifikan di seluruh dunia akan alternatif yang unggul murah dan melimpah dalam upaya memerangi influenza

7112383 theres such a negative perception of ethanol even though we present the facts
7112384 with high corn prices people think its a bad time to invest in an ethanol plant its been tougher than heck to get people to invest and thats unfortunate because its a really a good time to be building a facility

7112433 this decision shows good judgment on obamas part senator joseph biden will be an integral part of a white house team that can help barack obama get the economy back on track solve our energy crisis and re establish our foreign policy standards
7112434 i think joe biden is a fighter and i think he has got the right values he is ferocious he is not going to let the republicans get away with anything he is tremendously smart and a great speaker
7112435 i think it is going to be harder for mccain to attack him because they are friends
7112436 i think biden has long experience about attacking the republicans hes not going to let them get away with the swift boat type stuff they are starting to roll out already

7112461 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7112462 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7112463 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7112464 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7112465 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7112466 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7112467 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7112468 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7112469 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7112470 before abraham was i am yhwh would be excluded as products of the early church there are passages rated at least pink jesus probably said something like this like
7112471 but if it is by the finger of god that i cast out the demons then the kingdom of god has come to you
7112472 listen to me all of you and understand there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile but the things that come out are what defile mk 7 14 15
7112473 the sabbath was made for humankind and not humankind for the sabbath so the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
7112474 no one can get their sins forgiven except by going to the temple
7112475 the research component is an economic driver for the medical center
7112476 it is less expensive and highly profitable to do business in san antonio
7112477 im only looking for things that enhance research or clinical services
7112478 i had looked at pre owned homes but everything i saw was going to need work or i was going to be changing it to fit me
7112479 you can change it yourself in a pre owned but sometimes you just want to have it done
7112480 it was a perfect opportunity as far as the interest rates
7112481 i was living in an apartment and kept thinking i could be living in a home and having that tax advantage
7112482 young ladies today are self sufficient and are making decisions where in the past they were guided by their fathers or relied on a males suggestions
7112483 buying a home is a statement that i have arrived
7112484 it was really safe and well lit which was really important to me as a single woman
7112485 it can become the sanctuary after a hard day at work or juggling family activities
7112486 little niches cost almost nothing to do as a builder
7112487 at a lower price range it is almost never done but they can make the space feel like a more expensive home
7112488 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7112489 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7112490 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7112491 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7112492 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7112493 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7112494 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7112495 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7112496 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7112497 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7112498 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7112499 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7112500 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7112501 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7112502 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7112503 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7112504 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7112505 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7112506 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7112507 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7112508 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7112509 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7112510 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7112511 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7112512 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7112513 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7112514 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7112518 small socio political american elite that seeks to establish control over the very basis of human survival
7112519 reveals a diabolical world of profit driven political intrigue and government corruption and coercion
7112520 came to symbolize the hubris and arrogance of the emerging american century
7112521 the very science of life itself biology and its applications
7112522 the evolution of power in the hands of an elite led by this family determined above all to bring the entire world under their sway
7112523 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7112524 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7112525 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7112526 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7112527 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7112528 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

7112530 because of the nebulous and private nature of these investments it is more difficult to locate the exact genesis of these investments
7112531 it is increasingly difficult to track who what company what individuals are the actual ones controlling the levers of decision making and financial activity
7112532 it feels like arabian investors are making large investments in major institutions not the smaller one off actions its a lot of trouble for them to place 5 million 25 million or 50 million investments so they are making 100 million or 1 billion deals
7112533 i have to think that the ports project that fell through is causing arab investors to look at other areas that want the investments more
7112534 numerous studies have shown that once a country makes business investments there is a paucity of violence linked to terrorism
7112535 if a financial stake is established the nation is married to it
7112536 we had the same question about indian investments a year ago
7112537 we should look to our port san antonio as the major focal point to attract foreign containers logistics is the business of the future we could track the trends in the united states and canada and see where we can take advantage of those markets and then reach out to arab nations its a slow trend in our area though
7112538 we can try to be more culturally sensitive it is not a matter of right or wrong but an acceptance of differences and finding common ground
7112539 getting money back from arab nations means more salaries are paid to u s workers
7112540 its easy to be cool and objective when working with clients who must go over sentimental items but its extremely hard to do it yourself
7112541 obviously you cant take all of that stuff with you but youll want to keep some of it sometimes your gut tells you that youre not ready to discard something whether youre moving or not
7112542 your friends and relatives probably have good intentions but once they start asserting their value judgments the project can easily veer off course
7112543 he wanted nothing except a few wooden carvings from a church mission trip to africa and one soccer ball you could have knocked me over with a feather i was so surprised
7112544 in fact after their parents die many people are burdened by all the things their parents leave behind the kids must go through all this stuff and feel theyre dishonoring their parents when they have to get rid of lots of it
7112545 ellen james martin how to declutter a home in a hurry
7112546 for decades hes brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7112547 hes uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to bring our country back on track
7112548 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7112549 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7112550 in all my years in the senate i have never ever seen washington so broken
7112551 these times call for a total change in washingtons world view
7112552 im for mccain but i think obama is going to win because of the bush cheney problem
7112553 i want the next president and vice president to be as strong as possible
7112554 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7112555 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7112556 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7112557 redeem each of these designated tear off tabs to receive the best seats in the house
7112558 for the first time in a year i could watch match of the day last week without having to hide behind the sofa
7112559 time is footballs greatest healer and how refreshing it was to see a premier league team being laughed at and sneered at that wasnt derby county
7112560 we have won one drawn one and lost one this season and yet all some people want to tell us about is that we havent won for 34 league games
7112561 weve got good players at this football club and theyve not performed theyve let themselves down theyve let their team mates down and theyve let the fans down
7112562 that was a negative and right now i need two positives one to cancel out the negative and another one you know just so i can have a positive
7112563 always s t on the red side of the trent
7112564 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7112565 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7112566 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7112567 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7112568 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7112569 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7112570 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7112571 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7112572 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7112573 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7112574 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7112575 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7112576 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7112577 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7112578 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7112579 who are open to doing something on the production side
7112580 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7112581 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7112582 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7112583 kinderen zijn geen koopwaar daarom is de handel en bemiddeling v r de geboorte uit den boze
7112584 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7112585 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7112586 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7112587 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7112588 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7112589 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7112590 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7112591 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7112592 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7112593 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7112594 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7112595 watch your back rachel kat and darnell are the ones to watch
7112596 if we do nothing more if theres no extra investment above what we have now we will go backwards
7112597 thats based on seeing the amount of money other countries are investing even if we put a bit more money in well only tread water
7112598 be rightly pleased they have got more than their moneys worth people should be blown away
7112599 our position is that we would review high performance sport in terms of our policy after the olympics we didnt think it was appropriate to have any discussion about it until after the beijing olympics but it is no great secret that both the academy and the nzoc have serious financial pressures and we intend to address those in the next few weeks
7112600 address the high performance end of sport some time soon
7112601 the strategy is right and we have lots of confidence we are doing the right thing
7112602 can we do better of course we can should we do better absolutely are there things to improve on absolutely but the buzz around here from other nations is that we have done brilliantly
7112603 the number of others bubbling up in fourth to eighth those who get diplomas is important that indicates depth and flow on and is critical
7112604 ive still got time to get as many medals as him
7112605 this is a stepping stone for me ill give it everything ive got over the next four years and hopefully medal next time this has been a huge learning curve for me
7112606 could get up to six olympics if i tried dad was 40 when he was at his fifth olympics so if i wanted to go to 40 though i probably wont because i might be playing bowls instead
7112607 i had an average start i didnt quite have the gusto but kicked at halfway and caught up but my arms went to jelly in the last 100m
7112608 im definitely keen to keep the ball rolling weve got a lot of young kids coming through back home and weve got a lot of support from sparc we have a programme that will give them a better path to follow so im looking forward to that
7112609 if we do nothing more if theres no extra investment above what we have now we will go backwards
7112610 thats based on seeing the amount of money other countries are investing even if we put a bit more money in well only tread water
7112611 be rightly pleased they have got more than their moneys worth people should be blown away

7112616 the number of others bubbling up in fourth to eighth those who get diplomas is important that indicates depth and flow on and is critical
7112617 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7112618 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7112619 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7112620 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7112621 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7112622 we hoeven ons hier niet voor te schamen want dit zal het beeld van het hele seizoen zijn bloed zweet en tranen

7112627 if youre wondering why this is on my personal blog instead of the official second life blog and why you havent seen the kb article of the week lately either its because linden lab is undergoing changes in communication policy and preparing for future improvements as much as that doesnt seem to make sense i cant go into details now and i wouldve let you know earlier were it not for events beyond my control please pardon me i promise to share more if when i can do so in the meantime if you have ideas for how i can better help you by making video tutorials broadly visible in places ive missed let me know

7112886 the strange decision the spaniards made in the late 15th cenutry not join the rest of the known world as it moved reluctantly toward modernity

7112896 it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
7112897 when we unwrapped the baby to see her she realized it was moving i began screaming and ran with it toward the doctors
7112898 this is nonsense there was no miracle putting a live miscarried fetus in the cooler slows down the metabolism so it remains in suspended animation
7112899 a persons life has such a great value that we cannot take it we are not the owners
7112900 it will be a model at least in that it can show the way to other countries
7112901 in an explicit direct clear and undisputable way this constitutional reform recognized the conceived person to be the subject of rights therefore constitutionally the embryo is a person
7112902 the product of conception is protected from that moment and can be designated inheritor and donator it is concluded by this court that the protection of the product of conceptions right to life derives both from the mexican constitution and from international treaties and local and federal laws
7112903 sadly many of the leaders of pro life religious disability and medical communities remain unaware of the importance of the i 1000 initiative in washington state
7112904 if the i 1000 initiative passes in washington state the momentum is likely to shift toward the legalization of assisted suicide throughout the united states in a series of state by state initiatives
7112905 washington state was chosen by the euthanasia lobby as the most likely place to legalize assisted suicide in the united states
7112906 the euthanasia lobby has combined forces by focusing on washington state at a national level we must hold the line
7112907 the euthanasia lobby is united in their effort to use washington state as a springboard for their nationwide goal of legalizing assisted suicide they have raised an incredible amount of money from throughout the u s
7112908 i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause of the 14th amendment provided a right to privacy which means they would support roe v wade
7112909 i wouldnt have a specific question but i would make sure that the people i sent to be nominated for the supreme court shared my values thats why i led the fight to defeat bork roberts alito and thomas
7112910 i think its a hard sell and i dont see much upside to tom ridge except for john mccain likes him a lot
7112911 i dont think hes going to be a big benefit in pennsylvania and even if he is i think the downside is the rest of the country among conservatives are going to be upset about this just at the moment theyre beginning to work up being excited about john mccain
7112912 a gop strategist says the former pennsylvania governor is no longer being considered as mccains veep
7112913 youve got to keep the coalition together the republican base is just coming home

7112919 1994 crime bill 100 000 new cops and an 8 year drop in crime
7112920 joe biden is what others pretend to be a statesman that does not need to hide behind bluster to make america strong
7112921 american dream under 8 years of bush and mccain is slipping away
7112922 we dont have to have 4 more years of president bush and john mccain
7112923 this may be our last chance to claim the america we love to restore americas soul
7112924 im glad im not outside just thinking about being out there in the wet and cold maybe with no place to go gives me the shivers
7112925 were warm and dry and now the cold is shut out
7112926 my youre in a pensive mood you need to do something to take your mind off the weather
7112927 oh i dont know being with a lover comes to mind
7112928 tim if you were with a lover would you make love here or go to the bedroom
7112929 id like to have a bedroom with a fireplace then id have the best of both worlds
7112930 if your lover was here right now what would you be doing kelly
7112931 thats a rather intimate question tim but ill tell you
7112932 the lights would be low most of the light in the room would be coming from the fireplace we would be kissing and touching and undressing each other once we were undressed naked my lover might sit in your chair or he might be standing like ted is or he might be lying on the flokati there in front of the fireplace
7112933 in any event id be on my knees either in front of him or beside him and
7112934 yes fellatio id be making love to his penis with my lips tongue and mouth
7112935 yes ted i like having my lovers penis in my mouth i especially like it when i can take his soft penis completely into my mouth and feel it grow to a big strong erection as i lick kiss and suck him
7112936 jeez kelly that was great i havent cum that hard in a long time
7112937 that was great ive never tried to suck two cocks at the same time before tim said something but i didnt really hear what he said because i was busy sucking the last of his cum out of his cock
7112938 i strongly support roe v wade thats why i led the fight to defeat bork roberts alito and thomas

7112947 we believe he can help our hockey club and we felt strongly that we missed him last year
7112948 we missed his leadership and his play and his coolness
7112949 he wanted to come back and we wanted him back
7112950 you obviously dont want to enter into a new contract without resolving the past so we did that
7112951 after the bombardment we heard the rumble of the tanks and heard on the radio that the georgians had entered the town
7112952 i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same
7112953 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7112954 i think they were struggling between choosing a candidate would represent what barack obama represents change maybe thats somebody like new mccain ad joe biden voices concern of obamas inexperience to be president found this 7 hours ago on
7112955 senator barack obama picks senator joseph r biden jr of delaware to be his running mate
7112956 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

7112959 all the good work china did to put on these olympics could be forgotten because of an unnecessary arrogant move by the government why risk everything to put a 14 year old in the competition when they could have replaced her with an of age 16 year old gymnast sure he is a better gymnast than the chinese gymnasts who were eligible to compete but with the judges they had at the olympics would it really have mattered
7112960 what position do you think iowa will have after the commission has met
7112961 i was on the ground in iowa for clinton and some of the friends i made in iowa were at some of the rural caucuses they knew everyone in their small town and there was a lot of people who came in on a bus faces they didnt recognize who participated in the caucus and then left now those people might be from town but they suspect they might not be from the town but since the iowa state party doesnt release the list of who came and who didnt come we dont know
7112962 there was a lot there was about 2000 complaints about caucus problems in texas alone our thing with i own my vote is were not trying to say what did happen or what didnt happen whether the complaints were valid or not valid what we really want to do is repair the process so in the future theres no doubt theres no question everyone who is a shift worker is able to vote people who are elderly and home bound are able to vote by absentee ballot we just want the same high standards the dnc applies to general election to apply to their own nomination process
7112963 did you take up this complaint about what happened in boone with the state party
7112964 i would have to talk to my friends who i was talking to after the thing to get you that information but theres been a lot of complaints everywhere
7112965 my congressman i guess i shouldnt give out his name since it isnt on the record was at a caucus in des moines and people were just shouting out numbers and they werent counting people who were walking into a caucus in iowa were being plastered with obama buttons whether or not they were obama voters
7112966 i think that everyone that we talked to after the caucuses were very pleased with the caucuses whether that was senator obama or the next vice president senator biden
7112967 i think that i have my whole career i got involved in politics because of the civil rights movement i get over 95 percent of the vote of minorities in my state it may be possible because i speak so bluntly that people misunderstand but no one in delaware has ever misunderstood my committment to civil liberties
7112968 ive worked with joe biden i have absolutely no doubt of what is in his heart i will provide some testimony as they say in church
7112969 daar kunnen die rare moslims ook niets meer tegen hun beginnen
7112970 t is stil in amsterdam de mensen zijn gaan slapen
7112971 if nominated i will not run if elected i will not serve
7112972 i am not running for vice president i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7112973 was too inexperienced to be president because the job did not allow for on the job training
7112974 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7112975 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid a full escalation to full scale war
7112976 weve got send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7112977 the fur industry wants the public to believe that most of the mink liberated are recaptured or killed after being freed but this is not the case and i would argue that even if some are recaptured at least they have been given a chance at what everyone deserves a chance to live free
7112978 contrary to the rhetoric of those who profit from the imprisonment and killing of these beautiful wild creatures scientific studies have proven captive mink have the innate ability to survive in the wild do not decimate other animal populations or the environment and do not carry away small children or pets
7112979 our belief is that most americans even apsa members have no idea how precarious the rights of freedom of speech and conscience are in canada
7112980 and whereas while we know of no direct suppression of academic freedom that has yet occurred in canada yet the writ of canadas hrcs runs without evident limit to encompass any speech academic or otherwise to which potential complainants take
7112981 therefore we petition the council and staff of the apsa to take all steps necessary to ensure that academic freedom and free speech even on controversial topics such as these are not threatened at the 2009 annual meeting including soliciting legal advice and seeking the assurance of the government of canada and local authorities that the civil rights and liberties of members to free speech and academic freedom will be secure
7112982 lets remind everyone this is a video game and not a hockey simulation
7112983 will implement most of the changes that have been made to the upcoming ps3 version
7112984 we have absorbed and taken every piece of criticism about the game that was constructive and would help
7112985 on the 360 version what we wanted was to have more immersion with the camera being really close to the player
7112986 i pretend to like hemp milk because drinking hemp milk seems really cool
7112987 ok ok t is niet mijn schuld dat deze weblog momenteel slechte schrijvers heeft komt door die stakingen van het writers guild he dan worden dat soort dingen niet meer gecheckt dankzij die knuppels zul je het in ieder geval deze aflevering met die naam en thuisplaneet moeten doen
7112988 maar dat verklaard nog steeds niet waarom je hier bent
7112989 oh ja de producenten vonden het nodig om een kleurrijk en jeugdig karakter toe te voegen door al die po zie en semi literaire nonsens raken jullie een grote groep lezers kwijt in de belangrijke 8 tot 15 jarigen doelgroep geen 8 tot 15 jarigen geen sponsors in deze maatschappij dus ik ben aan de cast toegevoegd om de aandacht van die vervelende adhd koters te trekken
7112990 ho eens wij maken kunst op dit weblog dit is niet zomaar de zoveelste geenstijl kloon gericht op commercie en de grootste groep lezers dit is voor connaisseurs en intellectuelen dit is de vpro onder de weblogs
7112991 kan wel wezen maar het verkoopt niet dus eisen de sponsors en producenten meer karakters die gericht zijn op kinderen en meer aandacht voor volkszangers en andere sbs helden zoals nimweegs sjonnie ook willen ze graag weer wat vaker toevoegingen zien levert ook meer lezers op
7112992 up on the hillside its not a far ride if you came to have dinner i would be so gratified
7112993 the teacher is coming hes soon to have arrived youre making me look bad come on now step aside
7112994 when i say im hungry i havent lied give me some of that chicken that you just fried
7112995 chicken fried no thats for the teacher youre not purified
7112996 you lied you said youd be there at seven oclock you lied
7112997 no i have not lied i came at 6 59 and you told me to move aside i asked for bread and the chicken that was fried sound effect food cooking and you said that i wasnt purified
7112998 i wasnt notified i had no idea that you was the bum that cried
7112999 the first thing that i would do is call in john kerry bob kerrey
7113000 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7113001 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7113002 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7113003 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7113004 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7113005 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7113006 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7113007 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7113008 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7113009 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7113010 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7113011 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7113012 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7113013 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7113014 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7113015 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7113016 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7113017 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7113018 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7113019 then u got go in or not they lengchai ar

7113023 this is going to hurt me a lot more than its going to hurt you
7113024 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7113025 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7113026 we come from 17 countries and we have one common goal and that is to break israels siege of 1 5 million palestinians
7113027 israel has to be held responsible for its policies toward the civilian population they have absolutely no right in international law to declare an economic siege on gaza to harm the civilian population thats a form of collective punishment which is illegal
7113028 our original mission was to sail into gaza open up a sea lane so that they can actually use their sea lane and then break israels siege and to tell the world that the gaza mediterranean belongs to the people of gaza
7113029 reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals

7113032 for the moment a building and a bank have collapsed there is panic but we do not know if there are casualties

7113034 i wouldnt expect major damage because the quake has some depth
7113035 we hope to raise awareness to the risks of this ubiquitous drug
7113036 most caffeine addicts have no idea that they are addicts but with as little as 200 mg of caffeine you can experience typical addictive symptoms such as irritability restlessness tension insomnia excitement and gastrointestinal disturbance
7113037 if you boost that level to more than 1 gram 1000 mg you can get irregular heartbeats panic and anxiety disorders muscle twitching incoherent speech excessive urination flushed skin and depression and believe it or not when you take over 5 grams of caffeine the results can be fatal
7113038 the truth about caffeine how companies that promote it deceive us and what we can do about it
7113039 physical and mental health care are immeasurably important to the overall well being of the citizen
7113040 caffeine consumption can pose a significant hazard to health and longevity
7113041 linked to heart disease pancreas and bladder cancer hypoglycemia and central nervous system disorders
7113042 caffeine narrows blood vessels in the brain and stimulates the cerebral cortex the brains outer sheath this helps you think more rapidly and clearly elsewhere in the body blood vessels expand coordination improves
7113043 caffeine is used medically as a mild stimulant or headache killer caffeine citrate helps in treating sleeping problems in newborns
7113044 in healthy people moderate amounts of caffeine have little effect on blood pressure or heart rate bigger doses can cause agitation and ringing in the ears muscle tremors and irregular heartbeat if you quit coffee cold you may experience headache nervousness anxiety dizziness and irritability
7113045 are among the cities that have issued proclamations about the health risks of caffeine nebraska new jersey and wisconsin also issued proclamations
7113046 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7113047 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7113048 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7113049 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7113050 we will not negotiate with those who are attacking you who are attacking the poor people
7113051 they attack the poor labourers they want to snatch their livelihoods we strongly condemn such attacks against poor people
7113052 our tribesmen are patriotic people and we will negotiate with those tribes who isolate themselves from the militants
7113053 we are working for the economic uplift and development of the tribal areas
7113054 they are a handful of elements who are creating unrest the majority of people in pakistan are patriotic and peace loving the enemies of the country are behind those miscreants
7113055 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7113056 the speaking fee for musharraf would be in the 150 000 200 000 range for a day
7113057 plus jet and other v i p arrangements on the ground
7113058 if we did multiple events in multiple cities musharraf could get closer to the 500 000 to 1 000 000 range for a series of talks
7113059 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7113060 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7113061 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7113062 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7113063 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7113064 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7113065 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7113066 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7113067 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7113068 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7113069 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7113070 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7113071 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
7113072 this is what she does she hands out checks to fire departments for money that came from bills she voted against
7113073 she talks at the va about the importance of the gi bill congress just passed that she voted against she talks about the importance of renewable energy but shes voted against every renewable energy bill thats come up
7113074 and its the same with the bridge she cant have it both ways
7113075 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7113076 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7113077 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7113078 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7113079 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7113080 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7113081 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7113082 some consumers were paying thousands of dollars to be added to someones account to get a short term increase in their credit rating
7113083 im thrilled with fair isaacs willingness to take a second look at this

7113171 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille

7113176 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7113177 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time

7113180 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7113181 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7113182 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7113183 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7113184 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7113185 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm

7113201 there are a number of high profile cases in which three or four areas of legislation are exposed such as bail and parole decisions that have failed people
7113202 some said we would be skating on thin ice but no one said we would actually be in breach of the act
7113203 we decided if it was that murky that its hard for anyone to make a decision wed run with a campaign and wait for officials to come to us

7113236 sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7113237 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion
7113238 senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7113239 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7113255 relevant government departments but how enchanting to find nike speaking like the foreign office of an independent republic almost as if the sportswear firm has an extradition treaty with the chinese government
7113256 it hasnt of course so the rather more salient question is whether nike has any qualms about getting the famously gossamer touched chinese government to leave no stone unturned in the hunt for and lets keep stressing it an anonymous internet poster
7113257 nike is enlisting the services of a repressive regime to crush its enemies dont they find that at odds with the kind of inspirational rhetoric that drives their adverts where mavericks speak truth to power and the individual is fetishised
7113258 nike spokesman vada manager told the oregonian late this evening that contrary to earlier reported statements by the company the shoe giant has not asked the chinese government to find out who posted malicious rumors about it on the internet
7113259 thats quite different from what nike said earlier this week

7113331 when he ran for president in 1988 biden was accused of plagiarism when he did not credit neil kinnock then leader of the british labor party for much of his stump speech
7113332 was forced to quit the 1988 presidential race in the face of accusations that he had plagiarized part of a speech from neil kinnock
7113333 was caught lifting lines from a speech by british labor party leader neil kinnock
7113334 biden and reporters covering his campaign said that in speeches before and after that debate the senator has given kinnock credit for the same passionate rhetoric which he has used repeatedly in recent weeks
7113335 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it
7113336 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground as coal miners and come up and play football weak it was because there was no platform upon which they could stand

7113376 weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning
7113377 13 therefore preparing your minds for action and being sober minded set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of jesus christ
7113378 such hope in great blessings when christ returns not only encourages downcast christians it also prompts a reordering of priorities according to gods agenda and inevitably leads to ethical changes in ones life since peter is about to launch into an extended section of moral commands this exhortation to hope appropriately forms the transition point to the rest of the letter if peters readers will first know the great truths about their salvation and then begin a habit of visualizing themselves personally on a path of life leading without fail to unimaginable heavenly reward they will be mentally and emotionally ready to strive for a life of holiness before god
7113379 it holiness involves not only avoiding outward sin but also maintaining an instinctive delight in god and his holiness as an undercurrent of heart and mind throughout the day

7113447 to give you some historical context logan has been with the x men for a while now and has transitioned from being one of the new guys to being a core member of the team
7113448 hes even become an unsuspecting role model for new student kitty pryde
7113449 when the story begins wolverine is still desperately trying to make sense of the jumbled fragments of memory buried within his mind
7113450 professor xavier is at his wits end having unsuccessfully tried every method at his disposal to piece those memories together again the two heroes realize that their going to have to work together in a very unique way if they ever hope to discover the truth about wolverines past
7113451 charles and logan have always had a wonderful relationship charles is the ultimate authority at the school and we all know how logan feels about authority since their methods and mindsets are so fundamentally different the two often end up butting heads but they are still doing their best to work towards the same goal theyve been working together long enough to have a mutual respect for each other even if they both think their way of doing things is the right one it all makes for a tension filled team up that could only happen with these two characters
7113452 the story takes place all over the world without ever leaving xaviers school for gifted youngsters with charles xavier as your guide anything is possible
7113453 other than xaviers westchester estate well definitely be seeing a lot of canada throughout the series and in particular a certain top secret government facility deep in the canadian wilderness
7113454 well obviously be spending a good chunk of time exploring past events but weve managed to find a very exciting way to mix the flashback elements with a continuous real time story and have them both take place concurrently
7113455 that chapter of his life is our foundation and there will definitely be some new revelations about many of the characters involved as well as the events that took place within the facility
7113456 but not all revelations will come from our journey into the past we may even learn something new about the relationship between logan and charles xavier along the way
7113457 over the course of the journey both wolvie and professor x will find themselves in peril from a number of threats both past and present
7113458 but wolverine will quickly discover that his greatest enemy of all is actually deep inside himself
7113459 three of our most important supporting cast members appeared in the original weapon x story professor thorton dr cornelius and ms hines they were the people in charge of the experiment that bonded unbreakable adamantium to wolverines bones this story examines these characters through wolverines eyes and gives a bit more insight into the kind of people they were between the panels of the original tale
7113460 in the lead stories youll also see appearances by all of the x men of that time period storm angel colossus nightcrawler and kitty pryde and logans arch nemesis sabretooth
7113461 its not so grim and gritty that you would feel uncomfortable sharing it with a young reader interested in learning about wolverines past
7113462 the series isnt simply an angst filled journey through wolverines darkest memories theres also plenty of super hero action and even a bit of humor along the way
7113463 each short story will feature a different character from wolverines past and will give us a bit more insight as to how the weapon x program and or wolverine himself had an impact on their lives
7113464 these are brand new stories featuring some marvel favorites including sabretooth deadpool and gambit
7113465 the series features covers by the ultra talented michael ryan
7113466 and mark robinson is drawing the lead stories in all three issues
7113467 as for tim seeley well i just cant say enough good things about this guy hes drawing the back up stories in each issue which is no easy task each of the stories features a completely different cast of characters and a totally unique tone yet tim managed to make them all work perfectly and adapted his style as necessary to make each one special his take on our deadpool story made me laugh til i hurt people are going to love his work on this series
7113468 i decided a few years ago id send writing stuff to marvel i figured i had enough art stuff to fill the plate so no point in trying to get a mighty marvel editor but yeah so logically its just so much easier to get writing work especially when your credits are mostly a naughty slasher comic sigh i am dumb
7113469 but a friend of mine at tokyopop was a friend of mark paniccia since his office was doing the kind of stuff id wanna do anyway i sent writing samples over i sent stuff to paniccia for well lets just say awhile but he did like some of my art stuff a little and since his associate editor jordan white was one of my few hack slash readers it all worked out
7113470 sabretooth is a character fairly well geared towards a guy like me who just likes to draw scary hairy guys like myself
7113471 i loved that the story was set in the past and it allowed me to draw the original sabretooth costume as well as his pre lee texiera bulking up in this story hes more of a lithe gritty kitty than a furry tank
7113472 i tried to use a new style on these one which is mostly based on me having lots more time to make them full of all kinds of detail and little lines its more of a seeley unleashed kind of style rather than one based on economy of time so if ya ever liked my stuff youll like this better and if ya hated my stuff youll like this better
7113473 his scripts are tights lots of description and staging so all i have to worry about is making stuff look cool
7113474 it helps that he worked as a marvel editor i think as he has an eye for detail and caught my goof ups as early as the thumbnails his stuffs also often pretty funny and clever which has an obvious appeal to me
7113475 it was a far more pleasurable experience to draw for marvel than i ever expected
7113476 im one of those old cranky indie guys who thinks hes too punk for the big two but the truth is as soon as they offered i squealed like a scared monkey and dived right in and im glad i did
7113477 i had to take the events of one of marvels most classic and most violent tales and rework them into a story that would be acceptable within the all ages guidelines of marvels current first class books while still completely respecting mainstream continuity not an easy task but im always ready and eager for a challenge
7113478 as a huge fan of barry original weapon x story i couldnt have been more honored to be tapped for the gig

7113482 government believes this country cannot become a middle income country without adequate supply of energy at affordable prices adequate supply of energy could lead to the drastic reduction in the payment for cost of power generated
7113483 it was the hope of government that in the next 4 to 5 years consumers would be able to pay affordable prices for the generation of electricity
7113484 the first power megawatt of energy would have been supplied by the december deadline if gas was supplied for the project the lack of air conditioners and a charge of 0 4 percent for gcnet rates were the other challenges facing the completion of the project way beyond schedule
7113485 200 megawatts of energy would be generated by december this year whiles an additional 360 megawatts was expected to be generated before the end of 2009
7113486 the worst part of it was that when we were voting he was not there to vote against the whole transaction
7113487 the most unbelievable and ridiculous aspect of it was that his own party member on the floor of the house was the one who seconded the motion for the sale and when we got to voting all his other party members voted in favour of the sale
7113488 one it raises very serious questions about credibility i mean this is a credible leader of the cpp or this is just somebody who is playing politics
7113489 because he says this is the position of my party and constitutionally he is the leader of the party and on the floor of parliament we dont hear it and the worse part of it is that he can not whip his rank and file to support a position that he says is the position of his party
7113490 the party is not complaining about how much gt is being sold for but rather that fundamentally were opposed to the sale of strategic assets and also we want to ensure even if this thing goes through the mechanisms by which we can exact the terms of that sale
7113491 my key submission is that if things are not changing as they should it is because we are not serving as we should
7113492 the kind of service that move things forward or effect a change for the better in the church the nation and the world at large is not lip service but visible tangible purposeful and sustained service
7113493 we are to excel in serving and not in power struggle and self aggrandisements

7113504 i cannot remember any player who has left arsenal and been a superstar you know it is difficult dont get me wrong alex hleb and mathieu flamini are probably two of my best friends in football i wish them all the best i speak to them every week
7113505 arsenal is arsenal and this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it thats why you have to be intelligent in your decisions
7113506 i know what this clubs has i have spoken to a lot of players i have friends in spain in italy and they speak to me about other clubs and i know that im privileged to be where i am and i dont want to lose it
7113507 im still young i want to win things for the club i want to get experience and i want to compete because when you see football around the world you see very few teams that play the way that we play and i just enjoy the way we play
7113508 what can i say hes my friend but apart from that hes a professional hes a great passer of the ball he works hard defensively hes scoring goals now for me it would be perfect
7113509 he has experience he has won the champions league he has got to another champions league final hes a european champion and hes only 26
7113510 of course right now we are competitive but maybe in the middle we need somebody who can make some competition who can add another dimension i think thats all we need really all the rest is fine
7113511 with the champions league we should not be afraid of anyone
7113512 we have seen in the last few seasons that we can beat anybody so we have to be positive that this time we can make it to the final i have been to enough finals now to understand what happens you can play well and lose and play not well and win i think we have the quality and the experience to do it
7113513 and he destroyed everyone through sector one i dropped a couple of tenths at turn two and wasnt quite as quick as i would have liked through the next chicane but overall i was quite happy there is always a little time you can find somewhere but my lap wasnt a shocker
7113514 it has been quite a straightforward day from my perspective we knew after free practice that we had a good car so then it was a matter of progressing through the first two parts of qualifying i think the team has done a great job were well prepared and im in a strong position to fight for victory
7113515 if they hadnt done that starting second would definitely have been an advantage
7113516 its good to be at the front after what happened last time
7113517 the recent summer break didnt help in some ways because an incident like the one in hungary was frustrating but frustration can sometimes be a motivation and i just wanted to get back in the car and race again i originally intended to qualify on the harder tyre at the end but i changed my mind during the session and i think that was the right decision
7113518 but the team altered the car overnight and every change was positive i might have gone a bit quicker too but i locked the rear brakes at turn 12 on my final run
7113519 its very easy when you are riding horses like this you can see the size of him and he has a great will to win
7113520 soft ground fast ground it doesnt matter he eats up every day and he loves racing
7113521 we were very worried as he flew over on tuesday spent a couple of hours here and then flew back but he is an amazing horse and has a great constitution
7113522 he ran a good race and is obviously on the way back im sure youll see a different horse in two weeks time im not using the ground as an excuse
7113523 they put everyone under pressure for the first 20 minutes but if they dont score an early goal it becomes difficult
7113524 they conceded a goal then the crowd was not really good for me too because i was disappointed they didnt support their team and ive never felt this during my four years in the premier league
7113525 if the home team doesnt have a shot on goal every two minutes everyone is whistling and booing
7113526 this was something i didnt expect and i was surprised
7113527 it was difficult for them to play like this and its been like it for quite a long time now but if you dont score an early goal everything becomes much more difficult and we played really well
7113528 you can feel the tension you can see they play with tension they really want to do well but sometimes there is too much pressure for them playing for your club you can see the same england players more relaxed they use the ball but because they are with england they really want the result
7113529 at chelsea we never speak about our national teams but you can feel it when you play them i know every player on the england squad and i can feel the difference there is always pressure when you play for your club
7113530 chelsea need to win every game so what i am saying is england players worry too much about the result with the pressure from outside it becomes more difficult when everyone starts whistling after 15 minutes
7113531 we enjoyed the portsmouth game and the crowd were brilliant
7113532 we knew as soon as the game started we would play well and win when you open the game with a quick first goal everything becomes easier and with the quality we have it was a great situation for us
7113533 we tried to play a different way we tried to use the quality of all our midfielders and use our technique skill and passing game arsenal always play good football but sometimes it is not enough because in some games in the premier league you have to fight hard you cant use only technique
7113534 are you sure no no they play rugby and afterwards we play football
7113535 it is the same with my word i send it out and it always produces fruit it will accomplish all i want it to and it will prosper everywhere i send it
7113536 both books are a sympathetic but critical treatment of makarios based on a long study by mayes of the cyprus problem and close personal contact
7113537 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
7113538 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
7113539 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events

7113545 many people thought these boats will make a significant contribution to break the siege not only politically but also in terms of brining in goods equipment food and medicine
7113546 however once it turned out these boats contain too little food and mostly activists some people left the beach disappointed
7113547 the arab and muslim world should draw lessons and learn from those dozens of activists because they risked their lives at sea for the sake of strip residents and against the siege

7113554 many scholars currently see northern central america and southern mexico mesoamerica as the most likely location of the book of mormon lands however such views are private and do not represent an official position of the church
7113555 whatever kind of wife you marry you will never take a bride like christ did when he married the church you will never marry anyone estranged from you as the church was from christ
7113556 we cannot say for instance that it was as human that christ created the world or that divinity itself has its origin in mary

7113561 the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues

7113568 t he use of arable and meadowlands was under the supervision and direction of the community
7113569 just as the share of each member in so much of the mark as was distributed was of equal size so was his share also in the use of the common mark the nature of this use was determined by the members of the community as a whole
7113570 at fixed times and if necessary more frequently they met in the open air to discuss the affairs of the mark and to sit in judgment upon breaches of regulations and disputes concerning the mark
7113571 w hat existed in fact was not a tragedy of the commons but rather a triumph that for hundreds of years and perhaps thousands although written records do not exist to prove the longer era land was managed successfully by communities
7113572 senator joe biden has always been a champion for children and public education
7113573 after eight disastrous years of the bush administrations failed education policies sen barack obamas selection of sen biden as his vice presidential running mate signals a true change in the way the federal government will support the children and educators of this nation
7113574 an obama biden ticket will staunchly support public schools lead to a stronger economy and a stronger more secure nation this team will lead us to a democratic victory in november
7113575 sen biden believes our first priority should be to fund our public schools
7113576 he knows that public schools are the key to our security economically militarily and politically and he has always been willing to stand up and be counted for children public schools and public school employees

7113584 so that anthrax probably didnt come from top us labs after all
7113585 my reasons to disbelieve the us scientist theory are not based on discovered documents or interviews but rather
7113586 those who follow the news about the anthrax attack know that for years the fbi has been investigating american defense scientists
7113587 that day and for at least the week after would have been the worst time to smuggle anything out of a high security area
7113588 weaponized anthrax is in very short supply in the u s inventory the supply we do have is most likely kept in conditions that enable inventory down to the microgram it is surely weighed and measured anytime it is utilized for research
7113589 what does your common sense tell you most of my friends usually military at the time of the attacks believed the anthrax was a continuing near simultaneous attack with the plane hijackings of 9 11
7113590 is a former army officer who now works as a military analyst and freelance investigative journalist
7113591 i am a military analyst living in huntsville alabama before that i was an army officer and also a member of the iraq survey group my work has been on fox news american thinker rush limbaugh slate hitchens and 411mania

7113593 coughlin didnt know where it had gotten to after he saw it
7113594 s hortly after the invasion of iraq journalist con coughlin writing for the telegraph revealed that he had been provided with a document from what he called a reliable iraqi source which expressly showed mohammad atta the 9 11 attack ringleader training for the mission in iraq with saddams knowledge
7113595 i contacted coughlin while researching the book and he stood by his report as of mid 2007 it is doubtful that many other people have seen the original of this document including myself since even coughlin didnt know where it had gotten to after he saw it when i talked to him
7113596 while my coauthors and i have not seen it we find the contents of the document as described by coughlin to be within the bounds of reason

7113605 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the
7113606 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7113607 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7113608 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7113609 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board

7113666 many gathered together sit down in assemblies courts theaters army camps or any other common meeting of a multitude and with a great deal of uproar blame some of the things said or done and praise others both in excess shouting and clapping and besides the rocks and the very place surrounding them echo and redouble the uproar of blame and praise now in such circumstances as the saying goes what do you suppose is the state of the young mans heart or what kind of private education will hold out for him and not be swept away by such blame and praise and go borne by the flood wherever it tends so that hell say the same things are noble and base as they do practice what they practice and be such as they are

7113711 die w hler k nnen mit ihrer stimme f r die fdp ein deutliches signal gegen die finanzielle mehrbelastung setzen
7113712 nach den mindestl hnen ist das das zweite mal in kurzer zeit dass der staat direkt in ein bisher funktionierendes system von vertragspartnern in diesem fall rzte und krankenkassen eingegriffen hat indem er selbst die h he der beitr ge im november festlegt
7113713 die m gliche r ckzahlung von beitr gen ist ein viel zu schwaches wettbewerbliches element
7113714 der gesundheitsfonds ebnet den einstieg in ein staatlich zentralistisches gesundheitsweisen und ist ein direkter angriff auf die soziale marktwirtschaft

7113819 for a number of guys in the change room it was their first time over here representing australia playing the springboks on springboks soil so i was extremely happy with he way they performed
7113820 all 22 guys showed a lot of spirit determination and other than late in the game when we let them back in we had a fair bit of control throughout the whole game so it was slightly different to 2000
7113821 the boys got up and you look at history i guess and thats an indicator as to how hard it is coach robbie deans said

7113832 i really accomplished a lot these last couple of weeks

7113837 i have a party of 1 and a party of 2 come with me
7113838 i had wanted to commit last saturday when i was going to be on campus for their scrimmage and i was going to commit then
7113839 something happened and i didnt go and i just went ahead and committed this saturday i called coach slade the defensive back coach and we talked for a while and i told him i had some good news and that i wanted to commit to tennessee he was getting really excited and stuff
7113840 coach fulmer seemed like he was the most excited about the commitment of all the coaches
7113841 we talked about 25 minutes and we had a great conversation and he just said to give all the coaches a call and let them know about the commitment
7113842 tennessee theyve been my childhood favorite since ive been coming up and ive been telling people i wanted to get that offer
7113843 that day that offer came that pretty much ended my recruitment but i wanted to take some visits and see if there were some other schools that would interest me my visit was very nice the coaches the players i watched film with coach slade and how they used the safeties i can see myself there the next four years of my life
7113844 it was pretty much tennessee and everybody else but if anyone had a chance with tennessee it would be north carolina and then south carolina had a small chance

7113846 a practitioner must not receive a reward whether financial or otherwise of which a client is unaware in respect of services rendered to the client
7113847 a practitioner must not directly or indirectly offer to or receive from a third party a reward or inducement whether financial or otherwise in respect of services rendered or to be rendered to the client
7113848 is it right for a barrister to receive 100 000 from a third party where there has never been a fee note rendered to the solicitor instructing him
7113849 i would have thought the law society would have real concerns about that
7113850 then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be

7113857 scientists dont like to attribute single events to global warming but events fit a pattern
7113858 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7113859 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7113860 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7113861 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7113862 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7113863 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7113864 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7113865 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7113866 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7113867 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7113868 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7113869 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7113870 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7113871 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7113872 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7113873 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7113878 i got one in mind i havent left him a message but im going to and left him know what penny did deangelos tight now but i still have some things i can probably threaten him with
7113879 based on how he has looked in the preseason if john david booty did not have the big name and the background he would be on the wire for the final cut
7113880 this exploration is now banned by a provision included in the annual interior appropriations bill
7113881 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7113882 they have protected billions in tax give aways for big oil and tax loopholes for businesses who ship jobs overseas rather than making a serious commitment to the development of clean alternative energy that can transform our economy and create thousands of new jobs
7113883 you have so many ways of expressing yourself whereas we must make do with our hats and dresses
7113884 when i first came into the world the novelty of the scene made me like everything
7113885 however now my heart feels only an emptiness in the beau monde which cannot be filled
7113886 i have in leaving grey forever left my heart and soul he has one consolation that i have given him up for my children only
7113887 you whom i loved with such tenderness you who were the best of mothers adieu i wanted to strew violets over her dying bed as she strewed sweets over my life but they would not let me

7113895 re emrs what do you feel are the biggest hurdles in implementation and training for new systems in facilities today
7113896 i would bet that the pilot group was voluntary meaning self selectors probably more acutely interested in managing their health
7113897 re sisters of mercy health system st louis they are requiring vendors to register at vendormate com and pay an annual fee to do business with them
7113898 re soarian our hospital contracted six years ago for soarian financials we are a large metropolitan teaching hospital we were recently told by our siemens reps that the soarian financials will not be ready for hospitals like ours for another two years at least they want us to sign up for five more years of invision just in case soarian takes that long no apologies no regrets no embarrassment the reps did indicate that siemens would still make money off us soarian or not ive had this conversation with siemens three times in the last five years every two years soarian is promised another two years out so much for german engineering
7113899 unison will be looking at the trial very carefully to fully assess whether it is of real benefit to the patient experience or whether it is just cost cutting in todays computer driven world do we truly need a further erosion of the personal touch that is so essential to the delivery of a positive health care experience

7114159 the fact that less than half of his party approves of him thats not good

7114172 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7114173 in his very first appearance as the vice presidential candidate biden demonstrated that hes more than willing to play the traditional role of attack dog
7114174 he recited a litany of what many democrats feel is wrong with the current administration and linked his friend john mccain to them in doing so biden proved himself an able fighter in his initial outing
7114175 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7114176 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7114177 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7114178 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7114179 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7114180 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7114181 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7114182 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death

7114184 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
7114185 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

7114188 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7114189 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7114190 has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7114191 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7114192 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7114193 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7114194 the only guiding principle of sarkozys policy towards china appears to be not to displease beijing
7114195 there is a certain form of brutal repression that continues parallel to the olympic games
7114196 catholics united believes senator bidens selection as vice presidential candidate is a positive development for americans who respect leaders who have strong religious family and personal values senator bidens well known commitment to his catholic faith has inspired his advocacy on issues such as genocide universal health care education workers rights and violence against women his faith has helped him to find solace during times of tragedy and crisis
7114197 we are optimistic that senator bidens history of seeking practical means of addressing abortion will help move our nation beyond the divisive acrimonious and unproductive debate that has come to surround the issue senator biden accepts his churchs teachings on human life and can work to advance these teachings in ways that americans of all political persuasions can support
7114198 catholics united is especially hopeful that operatives on the far right will refrain from using senator bidens faith and the teachings of the catholic church as political weapons in the coming campaign faith and values should be used to unite americans behind solutions to the key challenges of this age war poverty lack of health care and a looming climate crisis and not as partisan wedges to divide voters

7114205 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7114206 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7114207 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7114208 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7114209 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7114210 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7114211 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7114212 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7114213 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7114214 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7114215 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7114216 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7114217 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7114218 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7114219 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7114220 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7114221 we will be coordinating with lets help and some other organizations in the community to energize share and make sure there is a location in topeka to serve everyone who needs it

7114241 ximo puig es el candidato que se encuentra en mejor posici n y es el nico que est demostrando tener capacidad de liderazgo en un cambio solvente que no se excluye a nadie con un amplio y s lido equipo presente en toda la comunitat
7114242 para que lidere el cambio en la comunitat valenciana en 2011 se ala carmen mont n diputada en el congreso y coordinadora de campa a en valencia
7114243 el cambio seguro solvente y participativo en un proyecto que se define como socialista y feminista en el que caben todos en pie de igualdad las mujeres socialistas somos la fuerza generadora del cambio creemos que entre todos y todas podemos ya que no vamos en contra de nadie ni utilizamos etiquetas del pasado o excluyentes ni somos pesimistas ni renegamos de la historia de nuestro partido ni de sus enormes posibilidades de transformar la sociedad como motor de cambio

7114251 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
7114252 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
7114253 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
7114254 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
7114255 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
7114256 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life

7114308 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7114309 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me
7114310 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7114311 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7114312 barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story an american story
7114313 he was a son of a single mom a single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids i was a different i was an iirish catholic kid from scranton with a father who like many of you struggled in tough economic times
7114314 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7114315 john mccain and the press knows this is a friend of mine he has served in the senate for 35 years and he wants to do right by america
7114316 i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate
7114317 weve got someone who hasnt forgotten where hes from who goes home to delaware every night on the train has a working class background from scranton
7114318 biden has a record of reaching across party lines to get things done not only in foreign affairs where hes an undisputed expert but somebody whos working to strengthen crime laws in the country prevent violence against women and work with sen obama to strengthen fuel efficiency standards in the congress
7114319 i think weve got a great partnership of foreign and domestic policy to keep our country safe and get our economy moving again
7114320 we think weve got a great pick weve got someone whos ready to partner with barack obama to bring change to this country
7114321 look were pretty good at keeping secrets and we pride our campaign on that
7114322 but what were not afraid to do today is to talk about our nominee for vice president
7114323 i think he can be ready but right now i dont think he is
7114324 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7114325 as with previous vice presidential picks biden looks likely to have little if any direct effect on vote preferences
7114326 in a new abc news washington post poll completed friday night 13 percent of registered voters said having biden on the ticket would make them more likely to support obama while about as many 10 percent said it would make them less likely to do so most by far 75 percent said it would make no difference in their choice
7114327 stupid my mistake born out of ignorance thinking i didnt have to prepare
7114328 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7114329 i didnt take sen bidens comments personally but obviously they were historically inaccurate african american presidential candidates like jesse jackson shirley chisholm carol moseley braun and al sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns and no one would call them inarticulate
7114330 barack obama is probably the most exciting candidate that either the democratic or republican party has produced at least since ive been around
7114331 some have taken totally out of context my use of the word clean
7114332 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me
7114333 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7114334 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong

7114346 i think he can be ready but right now i dont think he is
7114347 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7114348 as with previous vice presidential picks biden looks likely to have little if any direct effect on vote preferences
7114349 in a new abc news washington post poll completed friday night 13 percent of registered voters said having biden on the ticket would make them more likely to support obama while about as many 10 percent said it would make them less likely to do so most by far 75 percent said it would make no difference in their choice
7114350 stupid my mistake born out of ignorance thinking i didnt have to prepare
7114351 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7114352 i didnt take sen bidens comments personally but obviously they were historically inaccurate african american presidential candidates like jesse jackson shirley chisholm carol moseley braun and al sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns and no one would call them inarticulate
7114353 barack obama is probably the most exciting candidate that either the democratic or republican party has produced at least since ive been around
7114354 some have taken totally out of context my use of the word clean
7114355 pastor or chaplain can you be the one to do my funeral
7114356 the 1st brigade soldiers work day in and day out with their iraqi counterparts enforcing the rule of law on behalf of the citizens of the rashid district
7114357 it is imperative that we provide a safe and secure environment where the iraqi people live work and sleep
7114358 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7114359 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7114360 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7114361 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7114362 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7114363 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7114364 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7114365 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7114366 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7114367 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7114368 the 1st brigade soldiers work day in and day out with their iraqi counterparts enforcing the rule of law on behalf of the citizens of the rashid district
7114369 it is imperative that we provide a safe and secure environment where the iraqi people live work and sleep
7114370 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7114371 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7114372 we express our deepest sympathies to all affected and will continue to do all we can to assist
7114373 we appreciate the able service of law enforcement medical personnel the national transportation safety board clergy friends neighbors and family
7114374 we appreciate the outpouring of love weve received from neighbors family and friends your prayers and faith are sustaining us thank you our belief in the truth that families can be together forever lightens this heavy load of sorrow we will be reunited with lansing and dallin of this were sure
7114375 in addition sen biden has a strong record in opposition to anti choice clinic violence and voted to hold anti choice extremists convicted of violent attacks against doctors and patients at womens reproductive health centers accountable for their criminal actions
7114376 sen biden who is a cosponsor of the landmark prevention first act also has joined us in supporting commonsense efforts to prevent unintended pregnancy by improving womens access to birth control ensuring teens receive accurate sex education and supporting family planning programs
7114377 we really measure our success on how well our team sports performed
7114378 more individual athletes will finish with a gold medal around their neck than any other country if you want to look at it that way
7114379 one gold and 10 silvers is bigger than no gold and 20 silvers
7114380 the olympics is not about being second being third its about being first
7114381 the gold medalist will be covered and praised for the rest of his life but who remembers who won the bronze
7114382 ma anche una nota asse da stiro anzi credo che la scopa abba proprio preso il nome dallasse
7114383 anche se il governo federale preferirebbe che in california fosse proibita la marijuana terapeutica non puo forzare lo stato a farlo

7114387 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7114389 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7114390 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7114391 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7114392 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7114393 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7114394 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7114395 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7114396 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7114397 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7114398 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7114399 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7114400 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7114401 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7114402 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7114403 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7114404 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7114405 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7114406 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7114407 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7114408 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7114409 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7114410 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7114411 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7114412 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7114413 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7114414 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7114415 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

7114417 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7114418 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7114419 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7114420 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7114421 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7114422 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7114423 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7114424 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7114425 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7114426 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7114427 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del

7114430 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7114431 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7114432 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7114433 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7114434 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7114437 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7114438 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7114439 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7114440 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7114441 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7114442 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

7114447 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7114448 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7114449 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7114450 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7114451 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7114452 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7114453 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7114454 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7114455 girls are that way look at you and charlis god mom you arent friends with her anymore
7114456 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7114457 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7114458 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7114459 i mean even if sarah and i do love each other maybe we did need more time to get to know each other
7114460 so what youre saying here is you had a couple of bad days in europe and its over
7114461 time to grow up tommy some days your mother and me loved each other other days we had to work at it you never see the hard days in a photo album but those are the ones that get you from one happy snapshot to the next
7114462 i really felt the excitement in my heart it was pounding even before the curtain opened
7114463 he definitely brought the house down and delivered a true rock star performance
7114464 he is just so genuine and kind hearted the moment you have an encounter with curtis you cannot help but root for him
7114465 i think it showed on his face how blown away he was with all the people there for him
7114466 it put me completely at ease and allowed to pump out my chest and sing my lungs out
7114467 im extremely impressed he and producer marshall altman put together a fantastic collection of some of his best work
7114468 it was one of the best vocal performances ive heard from him
7114469 i think the band was fantastic and they really played well off each other
7114470 theres an energy between all of them that just feels good
7114471 the great thing about that cover was that the band nailed it thats a tough song vocally for singers like curtis and myself who have about the same range but he aced it
7114472 curtis style harkens back to a time in pop music when the pop star reigned supreme
7114473 with well crafted exciting songs to boot you have to love curty p
7114474 curtis has been looking forward to this moment for so long and it was really cool to see this show come together so perfectly
7114475 also it was really cool to have our parents there because they have been so supportive of him for his entire career
7114476 the most unique thing about curtis as a musician is his unbelievable passion when he lived at home in san diego our rooms were right next to each other and i remember hearing him singing and playing guitar until like 2 a m in the morning and this was on a school night
7114477 he never takes a day off and he never lets any obstacle slow him down and for this reason i have no doubt that he will make it big
7114478 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7114479 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7114480 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7114481 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7114482 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7114483 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7114484 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7114485 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7114486 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7114487 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7114488 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7114489 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7114490 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7114491 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7114492 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7114493 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7114494 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7114495 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7114496 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7114497 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7114498 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7114499 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7114500 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7114501 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7114502 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7114503 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7114504 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7114505 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7114506 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7114507 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7114508 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7114509 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7114510 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7114511 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7114512 the iraqi people the resistance and oil versus american bases
7114513 joe biden just held a conference call with reporters to
7114514 it will not lead as prime minister maliki said to more violence and bloodshed
7114515 remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
7114516 any agreement with the palestinian people must preserve israels identity as a jewish state with secure recognized and defensible borders
7114517 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7114518 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7114519 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7114520 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7114521 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7114522 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7114523 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7114524 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7114525 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7114526 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7114527 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

7114541 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7114542 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7114543 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7114544 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7114545 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7114546 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7114547 un hombre que ha logrado alcanzar sus sue os desde abajo
7114548 joe biden es de una aleaci n rara durante decenios l ha cambiado washington pero no le ha cambiado a l l es un experto en asuntos internacionales
7114549 el compa ero perfecto para la tarea de devolver al pa s sobre sus ra les
7114550 lo importante no es cuantas veces te caigas sino cuantas veces te levantas
7114551 el sue o americano se est perdiendo despu s de ocho a os de gobierno de bush

7114553 dios bendiga a los estados unidos de am rica y proteja a nuestras tropas
7114554 no hay nadie m s cr tico con la falta de experiencia de obama que joe biden
7114555 biden ha denunciado la d bil capacidad de juicio de obama en materia de pol tica exterior y ha reafirmado con sus propias palabras lo que los americanos est n a punto de comprobar que barack obama no est preparado para ser presidente
7114556 arrival departure time check in time from 12 00 check out time 10 00am
7114557 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7114558 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7114559 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
7114560 simply doesnt understand the challenges americas working families are facing because he isnt remotely affected by them
7114561 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7114562 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate
7114563 baseball is the best game in part because every night you go to the ballpark you might see something that youve never seen before no other sport can say that like baseball can
7114564 the dodgers did not get a hit but won the game the angels did not allow a hit but lost the game
7114565 this is the third time in the expansion era 1961 on that we had an eight inning no hitter bostons matt young threw one against cleveland in 1990 and the yankees andy hawkins threw one against the white sox in 1992
7114566 angels sp weaver can blame interleague play for his removal
7114567 there was a questionable scoring call in the fifth inning official scorer don hartack ruled it an error which was the correct call some official scorers will tell you that the first hit of a game has to be a legitimate one just in case it is the only hit of the game some may say it should have been scored a hit but imagine the uproar if weaver had gotten a couple of runs allowed no other hits for nine innings and that play was scored a hit it would have been viewed as a homer call for the dodgers
7114568 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7114569 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7114570 im afraid were going to see a lot more borrowing and spending
7114571 it is one reason why the bank of england is reluctant to cut interest rates they want to see the colour of the governments money
7114572 gordon browns transfer from gamekeeper to poacher has seen a major loss of credibility
7114573 it is hard to see much scope for anything when the budget deficit is already so large
7114574 we are beginning to see the true cost to the taxpayer of gordon browns dithering over northern rock in public he told us that no taxpayers money would be at risk in private his bankers were telling him that hundreds of millions of pounds were at stake
7114575 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7114576 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7114577 i kept in my mind that the dear leader would be watching that thought was real encouragement to me
7114578 he was probably trying to reduce the pressure on me
7114579 we are trying to push the women players to use skirts
7114580 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7114581 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7114582 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7114583 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7114584 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7114585 yea im eating a foot long yea you know i hate pickles
7114586 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7114587 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7114588 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7114589 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7114590 it was high time and i expected this negotiation to come to a happy ending by yesterday
7114591 its been complicated but now that everythings sorted im absolutely delighted
7114592 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i think that in these two years he has understood that milan is his home
7114593 i think in the first half in midfield we were dominated
7114594 we were not strong enough not quick enough and we suffered in there
7114595 i think when you want to play at the top you have to start the game in a different way than we did and have more personality and authority and that is where we were punished today
7114596 i believe that fulham started stronger than us and were quicker in the game and that corner that we didnt defend very well and then on i feel in the second half it was all us if you look at the number of shots they had
7114597 in fairness credit to them they were always sharp motivated defended very well but they didnt create enough chances to really win the game
7114598 i think it is ours to lose the game but it is fair to say fulham played well
7114599 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
7114600 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7114601 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7114602 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7114603 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience

7114724 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of united states of america joe biden
7114725 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7114726 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7114727 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7114728 i mean look the president had a choice and it was a tough choice when he came when 9 11 occurred he could either listen to the advice colin powell and shinseki and most of the uniformed military and john mccain as well and dick lugar and others or choose the advice of the vice president secretary of state the secretary of defense and others and he chose the wrong advice and this i think we need a fresh start to be able to gain any momentum on this war on terror and i dont think were going to see any feel a lot better if i knew that president bush was going to be elected and im not being solicitous if i knew he was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed and so i think youd see a difference in the way how you prosecute the war in iraq i think youd see a difference in how you dealt with homeland security and i think youd see a difference in terms of the cooperation with other nations in terms of getting the consensus on how to deal with controlling chemical biological nuclear weapons
7114729 and so ive believed for a long time a view shared by my republican colleague john mccain and many others as well that we need more force in iraq thats not a popular position to take but we need more force now in order to have less force later we need to gain control of security in iraq
7114730 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year

7114761 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7114762 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7114763 i think the performance was better than our performance against greensboro
7114764 our speed of play was much better and our closing down spacing was much better on defense our final third attacking was more creative and we had more chances and went up 2 0 and had a good first half
7114765 we didnt come out with the same bite in the second half and we allowed them to get back in the game it was a good lesson for our guys to make sure that were not taking things lightly at the start of the second half
7114766 overall our performance was solid and it improved on our performance against greensboro so im happy with that
7114767 sebagaimana saya katakan di hari kamis saya perlu menunggu dan berbicara pada dia setelah kembali dari tugas internasional dari situ saya akan membuat keputusan apakah dia tepat untuk dimainkan hari ini atau tidak
7114768 saya tidak memilih dia karena saya pikir dia tidak cukup fokus saya pun tidak merasa bahwa dia akan memberi kebaikan untuk dressing room dan usaha tim
7114769 tidak peduli sehebat apapun seorang pemain jika dia tidak dalam kerangka berpikir yang tepat maka dia takkan tampil dengan baik satu satunya yang saya pedulikan adalah memilih tim terbaik untuk berusaha menang
7114770 kesalahan ada pada tim dan kami semua menerimanya berbatov tidak ada dalam tim karena dia tidak dalam kondisi yang baik untuk bermain
7114771 saya akan bicara dengan dia di hari minggu dia masih pemain kami dan kami akan bekerja dengan dia di tempat latihan
7114772 el ex marido la hab a venido a amenazar a la ma ana y ella se fue pero despu s volvi porque hab a mucha gente lo que esper bamos hoy es que no la pusieran a trabajar pero tuvieron que esperar a que pasara esto
7114773 la hab a amenazado varias veces la esperaba afuera y le mandada mensajes
7114774 muy buena muy trabajadora y muy alegre a pesar de tener problemas
7114775 estaba con mi nena de 5 a os entonces la tir al suelo me tir encima de ella y despu s fueron varios disparos

7114777 capitalism is a great economic system provided the government lets the system work part of the capitalistic system is opportunity for success and failure there are no guarantees for success but government intervention is a guarantee for failure of the system
7114778 give governor 36 000 raise panel says salary isnt up to par with other govs
7114779 ive still got time to get as many medals as him
7114780 this is a stepping stone for me ill give it everything ive got over the next four years and hopefully medal next time this has been a huge learning curve for me
7114781 could get up to six olympics if i tried dad was 40 when he was at his fifth olympics so if i wanted to go to 40 though i probably wont because i might be playing bowls instead
7114782 i had an average start i didnt quite have the gusto but kicked at halfway and caught up but my arms went to jelly in the last 100m
7114783 im definitely keen to keep the ball rolling weve got a lot of young kids coming through back home and weve got a lot of support from sparc we have a programme that will give them a better path to follow so im looking forward to that
7114784 dont lean on the bars the bars keep the doors open get off the car car two i know its you car two
7114785 get off the fucking bars get off the fucking car
7114786 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7114787 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7114788 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7114789 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7114790 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7114791 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7114792 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7114793 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7114794 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7114795 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7114796 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7114797 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7114798 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7114799 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7114800 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7114801 tactically it isnt going to work because our guys go in and secure a neighborhood but because we dont have enough troops we have to turn it over to the iraqis and they cant hold it or wont hold it
7114802 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7114803 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7114804 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7114805 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7114806 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7114807 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7114808 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7114809 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7114810 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7114811 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7114812 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7114813 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7114814 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7114815 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7114816 nos form para poder romper con las concepciones asintencialistas de las pol ticas sociales instaladas a partir de gobiernos corruptos ayudando a las iniciativas barriales a organizarse para poder instalar pol ticas sociales con participaci n popular donde las soluciones salgan de quienes sufren directamente los problemas

7114818 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7114819 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7114820 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7114821 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7114822 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7114823 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7114824 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7114825 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7114826 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7114827 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7114828 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7114829 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7114830 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7114831 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7114832 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7114833 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7114834 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7114835 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7114836 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7114837 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7114838 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7114839 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7114840 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7114841 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7114842 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7114843 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7114844 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7114845 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7114846 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7114847 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7114848 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7114849 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7114850 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7114851 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7114852 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7114853 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7114854 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7114855 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7114856 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7114857 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7114858 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7114859 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7114860 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7114861 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7114862 todo residuo que pueda causar da o directa o indirectamente a seres vivos o contaminar el suelo la atm sfera o l ambiente en general los principales rpu est n dentro de los llamados residuos electr nicos conocidos con la sigla raee como las pilas y acumuladores de todo tipo
7114863 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7114864 yo no s nada sobre lo social a m me dan ladrillos y construyo casas
7114865 yo no soy el que tiene la respuesta a su problema
7114866 nosotros no tiene por qu intervenir el problema es de la empresa ellos tienen que entregarnos las casas terminadas y sin gente adentro
7114867 no s si el estado municipal puede garantizar la integridad f sica de las personas es un tema legal que desconozco
7114868 los mandaron de la oposici n para perjudicar a barbieri
7114869 desde los pobladores de un asentamiento precario que luchan por un techo propio o los trabajadores de un hospital cerrado en funci n de pol ticas de ajuste hasta los travestis que no quieren seguir soportando la extorsi n policial los vecinos de un barrio que reclaman por la falta de sem foros en una avenida o por la descarga a cielo abierto de contaminantes ambientales saben que la presencia de una libreta de apuntes un grabador o una c mara es imprescindible para apuntalar sus demandas
7114870 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7114871 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7114872 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7114873 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7114874 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7114875 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7114876 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7114877 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7114878 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7114879 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7114880 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7114881 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7114882 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7114883 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7114884 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7114899 it was high time and i expected this negotiation to come to a happy ending by yesterday
7114900 its been complicated but now that everythings sorted im absolutely delighted
7114901 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i think that in these two years he has understood that milan is his home
7114902 our ambitions for the season must remain the same we have got to try and stay in this league
7114903 this is a very tough league to stay in we have seen already with stoke winning hull beating us the so called bottom teams are taking points already
7114904 we have got to be modest and humble and we know we have got to work as hard as we did today in every game to get a result whether you are playing the arsenal or one of the teams who are being tipped for relegation
7114905 if we can get that into our thick skulls then we stand half a chance
7114906 i thought the quality of our passing and movement matched the arsenals and im really delighted about that because if you get anywhere near to matching the arsenal that is something you have to be very proud of
7114907 i think we should take you to all our games last time you interviewed me we had just beaten portsmouth 1 0 to stay in the league and now we have beaten arsenal one of the very best teams in the league to show that maybe we have the pedigree and that we arent out of place here
7114908 i think in the first half in midfield we were dominated
7114909 we were not strong enough not quick enough and we suffered in there
7114910 i think when you want to play at the top you have to start the game in a different way than we did and have more personality and authority and that is where we were punished today
7114911 i believe that fulham started stronger than us and were quicker in the game and that corner that we didnt defend very well and then on i feel in the second half it was all us if you look at the number of shots they had
7114912 in fairness credit to them they were always sharp motivated defended very well but they didnt create enough chances to really win the game
7114913 i think it is ours to lose the game but it is fair to say fulham played well
7114914 it feels really good we are fortunate to get it its a blessing we finally started hitting the ball and i thought we pitched well the whole game
7114915 im sorry we didnt get the gold japanese fans were looking forward to the gold medal but we didnt bring it back i feel sorry about this we have never experienced such a tough time before
7114916 a vantagem salarial de homens em rela o s mulheres pouco variou na ltima d cada em portugal a discrimina o salarial entre homens e mulheres pouco evoluiu numa d cada em portugal em 1997 as mulheres recebiam 72 9 por cento do que era recebido pelos homens nas mesmas fun es passados dez anos essa desvantagem era de 74 6 por cento
7114917 as it the initial decision was an obvious mistake and we are the hosts we want to show sporting spirit and we would not object to the reverse of the decision
7114918 absolutely sure i never thought it was possible i wasnt even really sure of my medal chances at all
7114919 after the last dive i though thats it silver medal fantastic then i looked up and id come first
7114920 i was in good mental form at the beginning but it didnt stay until the last dive its a pity
7114921 but im still young i can draw lessons from this competition to help my future life
7114922 many players cried after we lost to brazil yesterday and how to adjust their mental state was a big problem for us
7114923 im still happy with this tournament although we didnt get a gold or silver medal we tried
7114924 what you think is really important to north east lincolnshire council we really want to know your priorities and we want to make it easier for you to influence the work that the council and its partners do
7114925 we want to know what everyone thinks whether youre eight or 80 english or migrant rich or poor we are aware that many of you work so we have made the bus accessible at various times throughout the day and into the evening at places that are convenient to you such as tesco and morrisons
7114926 north east lincolnshire council cares about your thoughts and how you would like to improve your area please come and join in the conversation with us together we can make a difference
7114927 about 3 55 where i live today people are aware enough on a daily basis that a station trying to sell at 5 per gallon would get nowhere a station selling at 3 25 might get lots of business because that would be a rare short term deviation from the standard
7114928 for five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered
7114929 other than on clay i was always expected to win
7114930 maybe now it changes a little bit because obviously theres a shift in the rankings
7114931 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7114932 but so far hes been great and played so well on all maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having number one next to me
7114933 i know what it takes to win the us open
7114934 thats always a huge advantage i have i come here as a defending champion so i always have great feelings about this place
7114935 this is quite a unique season rafa wasnt happy with the clay court season i was not particularly happy with scheduling at the olympics we all wish we would have had more time between wimbledon and the olympic games or after
7114936 but there was not really a whole lot we could do because of the olympic games every four years maybe there will be a tough season like this
7114937 next years schedule will already be much better well have much more time and wont be forced to play every single week
7114938 canadians will like the fact that both of them are opposed to the war in iraq
7114939 theyll like the fact that theyre both knowledgeable about world affairs theyll like that obama and biden will take a multinational approach and not an our way or the highway approach to international issues
7114940 the idea that we are not willing to take the prime minister of canada and the president of mexico to the mat to make this agreement work is just a lack of presidential leadership
7114941 certainly obama and biden will take a more aggressive approach to increasing fuel efficiency for automobiles thatll be tough on the auto industry but they can do it and generally they favour a more aggressive approach on environmental regulation
7114942 so right at the top of the ticket you have someone who brings significant expertise in areas that concern canadians
7114943 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
7114944 theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me
7114945 youve had them for how long you should get better ones
7114946 a north derbyshire man who hosts a show on a popular english language radio station in china is living an olympic dream by experiencing the hype first hand richard bradbury from hollingwood went to china on a one month trip but three years later is still living and working in beijing he co hosts a radio show called the pulse on china radio international after impressing station bosses with the demo tape he sent in while trying to secure a job and a visa to allow him to stay in the country
7114947 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7114948 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7114949 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7114950 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7114951 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for
7114952 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries

7114989 i think in the first half in midfield we were dominated
7114990 we were not strong enough not quick enough and we suffered in there
7114991 i think when you want to play at the top you have to start the game in a different way than we did and have more personality and authority and that is where we were punished today
7114992 i believe that fulham started stronger than us and were quicker in the game and that corner that we didnt defend very well and then on i feel in the second half it was all us if you look at the number of shots they had
7114993 in fairness credit to them they were always sharp motivated defended very well but they didnt create enough chances to really win the game
7114994 i think it is ours to lose the game but it is fair to say fulham played well
7114995 there are a number of high profile cases in which three or four areas of legislation are exposed such as bail and parole decisions that have failed people
7114996 some said we would be skating on thin ice but no one said we would actually be in breach of the act
7114997 we decided if it was that murky that its hard for anyone to make a decision wed run with a campaign and wait for officials to come to us
7114998 it would be a pretty brave government who would take a victim to court
7114999 it would be the best promotion we could ever get people are irate about this act they want the freedom to have their voice heard
7115000 i can give you some general guidance along with the recommendation that you obtain your own independent advice as well
7115001 unhelpfully vague in a number of important respects including the definition of an election advertisement
7115002 we havent got the financial resources to mount a legal challenge if we press ahead
7115003 implicates the right to freedom of expression under section 14 of the bill of rights in several respects
7115004 consider it prudent to rely on the possibility of a court reaching such a conclusion
7115005 we would have all kinds of administration things to add on and there are huge questions over whether the charities commission would then regard organisations like ours as a political lobby group
7115006 according to informed sources the amount of the sale is 150 million

7115014 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7115015 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7115016 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7115017 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7115018 we could have the lord almighty be nominated and someone in this country will communicate to the committee something negative about that person
7115019 if we do nothing theres a serb victory and the continuation of genocide
7115020 if we do what you want we only have two options
7115021 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7115022 i get on the bus at 5 00 a m to get to work by 7 00 a m i shouldnt have to do that if we had a living wage increase each time
7115023 i hope that they see that things are not well with state government
7115024 and if things are not well in state government on the basic grass roots level it is going to harm the people of west virginia because we work for them we dont work for joe manchin we work for the people of west virginia
7115025 when i left 27 years ago ohio was on top
7115026 we didnt make the adjustment as others did to a new knowledge economy driven by something else
7115027 we wanted to align with the state plan but make sure we were doing the right things for the region
7115028 all the numbers you look at were well behind the rest of the nation we rank 40th in the nation in the population over the age of 25 that have baccalaureate degrees
7115029 in a global society a global knowledge economy where the currency of this economy is talent you cant compete
7115030 weve worked very hard to be an affordable institution because 40 percent of our students come from families of incomes of less than 50 000
7115031 in our new strategic plan were going to spend a lot of our strategies on how do we make sure these students succeed
7115032 that is an increase of about 150 percent over the last six years
7115033 help grow the economy as we take innovation to market
7115034 were creating that because we need to get a higher percentage of those research dollars that go through the air force research lab at wright patterson air force base staying right here
7115035 were really committed as we go into the future to align our capabilities with the needs of the region and to make sure that were helping to transform the region
7115036 weve been meeting about this issue for about 18 months and we have been able to locate some dollars for a recruiting drive
7115037 with diversity at an all time low we think this a good time to start that effort

7115040 the trend is growing at an alarming rate its hard to tell who will succumb to pegged jeans next however based on our tracking thus far there is a high probability that mischa barton will be the next victim given her affinity for unflattering trends such as high waisted shorts we suspect john travolta will likely fall prey to the boyfriend jeans look as well
7115041 our ambitions for the season must remain the same we have got to try and stay in this league
7115042 this is a very tough league to stay in we have seen already with stoke winning hull beating us the so called bottom teams are taking points already
7115043 we have got to be modest and humble and we know we have got to work as hard as we did today in every game to get a result whether you are playing the arsenal or one of the teams who are being tipped for relegation
7115044 if we can get that into our thick skulls then we stand half a chance
7115045 i thought the quality of our passing and movement matched the arsenals and im really delighted about that because if you get anywhere near to matching the arsenal that is something you have to be very proud of
7115046 i think we should take you to all our games last time you interviewed me we had just beaten portsmouth 1 0 to stay in the league and now we have beaten arsenal one of the very best teams in the league to show that maybe we have the pedigree and that we arent out of place here

7115050 are we saved by grace through faith or grace and our intellectual ability i want to affirm the former for if the later is correct then salvation is too dependent on human ability enlightment sic thinking then upon god my point becomes this if god is willing to save us who seek to obey him but do so with certain limitations or incorrect understandings about the doctrine of baptism will god not do the same for other believers who also have certain limitations or incorrect understandings
7115051 and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
7115052 and believe that gods church was spiritually inadequate for the task set before her
7115053 and you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him if indeed you continue in the faith stable and steadfast not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven and of which i paul became a minister
7115054 you are the salt of the earth but if salt has lost its taste how shall its saltiness be restored
7115055 then the angel showed me the river of the water of life bright as crystal flowing from the throne of god and of the lamb through the middle of the street of
7115056 let those of us who are mature think this way and if in anything you think otherwise god will reveal that also to you only let us hold true to what we have attained brothers join in imitating me and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us for many of whom i have often told you and now tell you even with tears walk as enemies of the cross of christ their end is destruction their god is their belly and they glory in their shame with minds set on earthly things but our citizenship is in heaven and from it we await a savior the lord jesus christ who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself
7115057 i appeal to you therefore brothers by the mercies of god to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your spiritual worship do not be conformed to this world but
7115058 and it happened that while apollos was at corinth paul passed through the inland country and came to ephesus there he found some disciples and he said to them did you receive the holy spirit when you believed and they said no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit and he said into what then were you baptized
7115059 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7115060 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7115061 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7115062 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7115063 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7115064 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7115065 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7115066 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7115067 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7115068 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7115069 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate

7115078 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7115079 in his very first appearance as the vice presidential candidate biden demonstrated that hes more than willing to play the traditional role of attack dog
7115080 he recited a litany of what many democrats feel is wrong with the current administration and linked his friend john mccain to them in doing so biden proved himself an able fighter in his initial outing
7115081 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7115082 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7115083 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7115084 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7115085 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7115086 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7115087 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency

7115093 we know that during the afternoon ahmed and a group of friends were on the top floor of the block of flats they saw the group of six youths approach the estate on bikes at that point they decided to leave ahmed had become separated from his friends who went to the third floor
7115094 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille

7115142 you know i never understood the point of toast before but now i suddenly get the appeal
7115143 particularly after everything that happened at canary wharf but i think the best way to make a change is from the inside martha told me that just recently and i think shes right plus i think if i scratch their back they will scratch mine
7115144 plus i need money and also i am quite brilliant and it would be selfish of me not to share my superior wisdom with the human race
7115145 well i had all that didnt i all that stuff and i fell through the void and i lost it all

7115153 its the lady that i saw a few weeks ago at the opening of
7115154 in fact came from nothing more than speculative froth and that translated into
7115155 going on the show forced me to lose weight and get off my ass
7115156 damian the shows diet guru said i had the worst diet hed seen i ate takeaways out of laziness
7115157 i dont buy a whole box and sit at home on my own and drink it all now
7115158 im still not where i want to be i have still got a little bit of a gut but im not hugely obese like i was before i would like to be pretty ripped
7115159 its simple and a matter of picking up and reading trends about what people are thinking
7115160 its all freaks and geeks all over again one year its the anorexics the next its fat people
7115161 we have such a big obesity problem that the fat shows are going to keep coming for some time i imagine
7115162 real life long term management or losing weight is making gradual changes
7115163 its not as difficult as its played out on tv
7115164 we seem to think everything has got to be really hard for it to work but people can lose a kilo a week just making small changes
7115165 realistically you should only lose 1 per cent of your weight a week

7115173 is this a private party or can anyone join in
7115174 if i wasnt here that would be bad but as it stands the universe is safe for another day thats the thing about paradoxes you really have to tidy them up or everything becomes unravelled like a dropped stitch in the knitted jumper of the space time continuum
7115175 look you idiot im you and i know youre hurting but you have to tell her how you feel about her
7115176 you can if you cant manage those three little words you could at least tell her the truth
7115177 she said that you or rather i never saw her and we both know thats a lie go and talk to her
7115178 if i do that if i open up to her itll hurt even more when she leaves me again
7115179 technically im the thirteenth and no i wont tell you what your other regenerations look like
7115180 now go and talk to her would it help your so called courage if i said that the universe depends on your talking to her
7115181 but i had to get out of there before i got hurt its time for me to move on
7115182 by the way the red head by the bar has been eyeing you up for a while now
7115183 although granted im kind of different than i was before
7115184 i remember when i first met you in the hospital
7115185 well youll see my tenth self again so dont panic hes not due to regenerate for a long while yet
7115186 i thought you completely changed your face not just a few features
7115187 as i told my tenth self im technically the thirteenth
7115188 well you sorta look like your tenth self except for the red hair green eyes the fact that you look to be more muscular and youre taller than you were
7115189 your accent is different too what is that scottish and london mix
7115190 a story i cant reveal without endangering the timeline i can say that ive grown quite fond of my tenth selfs face but
7115191 wait you met your tenth self isnt that against the laws or something
7115192 no because i remember it happening so i had to close the loop
7115193 oh and martha dont let my tenth self get you down hes incapable of expressing his inner emotions sometimes but he needs a kick in the behind sometimes when hes being insensitive
7115194 i like this look on you love the black leather look all thats missing are a few tattoos
7115195 besides what makes you think i dont have any tattoos
7115196 doctor can i speak to you in private for a minute
7115197 what makes you think ive got an hidden motive for being here cant i pop in and see two old friends without having a reason
7115198 i know that unless there was a threat of alien invasions you hardly ever catch up with your old companions
7115199 why i saw rose not so long ago i fell through a crack into her universe anyway shes moved on and has a um partner
7115200 her name is gwen not your gwen the alternate one
7115201 well because i care for her and my tenth self is an arse for letting her think otherwise thats why i went to see my tenth self he needed that kick
7115202 so you told your tenth self to tell her that he cares for her before its too late
7115203 well lets go and see her before she feels abandoned
7115204 dont tell her what we were talking about at least not yet
7115205 i was in the area and just thought id stop by
7115206 oh and it has nothing to do with your thirteenth self popping in a little while ago
7115207 he came to see you too can you believe hes ginger that is not fair and that long black coat he stole that piece of fashion statement from me
7115208 hardly anything i got the feeling that he told jack more than me
7115209 what did he say to you he did say that he went to see you and something about closing a loop
7115210 when you said i didnt see you you were wrong
7115211 i may be a time lord but i definitely am not blind and my thirteenth self reminded me of that
7115212 see i was right you do need a boot up the backside now and again
7115213 so what do you say martha one more trip for old times
7115214 the way i heard it she hasnt exactly turned you down yet
7115215 she just wants you to come back in the morning
7115216 ill come back in the morning she misses you you know
7115217 she was asleep when i came here i better get back before she wakes up
7115218 ill see you in the morning martha see you soon captain
7115219 if its three oclock in the morning i will kill him
7115220 sorry about him i think he sets the tardis clock an hour fast or something
7115221 nonsense you go and sit down he needs an answer anyway
7115222 i hope you say yes while skinnys all right i want to have someone i can have girl talk with
7115223 make him squirm a bit first before you give him the answer
7115224 doctor for gods sake put your arse to an anchor
7115225 who the hell is that at this time in the morning
7115226 while its embarrassing to ask for help from your younger self i need to oh hello donna
7115227 yikes im going to have to get used to this old desktop again
7115228 im the doctor thirteenth to be exact and i need your help in finding my tardis
7115229 because if you dont i will be in your hair forever more
7115230 and judging by the looks of it you dont need any more things in that untamed mess you call hair
7115231 well come on lets find my older self his tardis and then send him on his way
7115232 of course its bad it means that ill have to spend some more time with my younger self and while the female company is good
7115233 i know my tenth self really wants me out of the way i think he wants you two lovely ladies for himself
7115234 but my other companion keeps him in line smacking him when he gets out of line i think he enjoys it
7115235 im going to let the tardis drift in the vortex for a while its set so that if theres even a blip of the other tardis itll lock onto it
7115236 why dont you go and grab something to eat get some sleep or whatever
7115237 well hes out of time and he has to be careful on what he says around you and falling in love with martha
7115238 anyone with eyes can see that your future self fancies her no scratch that he definitely loves her you can see it in his eyes
7115239 what maybe hes just pleased to see her again i mean she is in his past and
7115240 if my thirteenth self is in love with her then thats his business
7115241 why she fancied you i dont know but if she fancies him i can see why
7115242 ill just go and set the tardis controls for our next destination then
7115243 i never wouldve guessed with the bumpiness i should write you out a traffic ticket
7115244 oi stop your arguing or im going to hurt you
7115245 a giant bear it mustve escaped from a zoo or something
7115246 ten remember where the anti vemon is kept in the med bay well go and get it
7115247 yep thirteen you go with martha and donna youre with me
7115248 thirteen you and martha do the device and donna and i will see to plan b
7115249 what have they got against rock and what do you have against country
7115250 if we can lure it over there then we can rock this joint and disable the critter
7115251 and while were doing that your tenth self and donna are working on plan b
7115252 thats your plan sing so it what collapses or something
7115253 just in case if it all goes pear shaped urgh i hate that word activate the screwdriver
7115254 have a little faith donna have i ever failed you yet
7115255 they may resemble giant teddy bears but they have poisonous claws and sixteen inch fangs definitely something you do not want to snuggle up with
7115256 so i doubt the aliens are going to criticize your singing
7115257 nothing against gwen stefani but thats not rock or disney
7115258 do you really think that the alien would be able to tell the difference
7115259 rock like def leppard queen rolling stones the who inxs aerosmith that sort of thing
7115260 i once had a companion that was into nine inch nails
7115261 right well now that the alien has been dealt with
7115262 dont worry ill be back go have a picnic or something
7115263 well martha could end up with ants in her shorts
7115264 martha this is rose you both know im the thirteenth doctor and please no fighting
7115265 so two doctors together isnt that bad i mean two versions of the same doctor
7115266 god yeah thirteen has misplaced his tardis and we have to help him find it him and the other doctor are usually at each others throats
7115267 i missed you but i moved on and i found someone
7115268 but as the rift is shut for the moment it looks like youre stuck with us for now
7115269 sorry i forgot you dont like pears do you doctor
7115270 no right lets go and pick up donna and jack and then we can have a nice little adventure
7115271 although that last planet we were on had distinct possibilities
7115272 you werent the ones being forced to walk around naked because the males on that planet werent allowed to wear clothes one experience i would like to forget
7115273 but not one im likely to repeat any time soon
7115274 males were thought to be inferior and just for breeding
7115275 we didnt want anyone else to get their hands on them
7115276 so there the three of them are naked but fitted with collars and leashes we had to get a part for the tardis so we couldnt leave straight away
7115277 i told you time is very wibbly wobbly and when we got to where i remember where the tardis is it had been moved time is in flux and it totally sucks oooh that rhymed
7115278 we got to whip them if they got out of line
7115279 you wouldnt think it but the thirteenth doctor is quite muscular under those black clothes he wears and has a couple of tattoos on his body jack is well as youd expect and the doctor mmm very nice
7115280 regardless of what you think i dont drop my trousers at every opportunity
7115281 oh come on as much as i love my girlfriend if you think im going back to the alternate universe without seeing you drop your trousers first you have another think coming
7115282 if you two tight laced time lords arent willing to do it
7115283 you see my younger self is a little self conscious about his body
7115284 am not i dont see you rushing to drop your trousers any time soon
7115285 dont worry rose you will get your wish before either of us leave
7115286 is it written that different incarnations of the doctor must not get along
7115287 we need to get them both to shut up and soon before they wake rose
7115288 theyre arguing on whether cheese on toast is better melted or not
7115289 or you could just whistle jack you know put your lips together and blow
7115290 its all muscle but you wouldnt know about having that would you
7115291 we would like you two to stop your arguing before i bang your heads together
7115292 well lets just say he was never the same after that
7115293 cant tell you but you doctor martha jones are a genius
7115294 i thought so but the masters a bit like dracula he always come back
7115295 he was prime minister and tried to take over the world start an intergalactic war that sort of thing
7115296 hey this isnt going to have any strange side effects will it
7115297 but i resigned myself to not seeing him again so i forced myself to move on i didnt want to be one of those tragic romance novel heroines that pine away after their lost love
7115298 out of the two doctors which one would you rather kiss
7115299 its the end of the world you have to snog one to save the whole planet which one do you choose
7115300 id only snog you to save the world nothing else
7115301 you and martha have to spend seven minutes in that cupboard
7115302 what do you think theyll get up to in there
7115303 who knows they might just talk or they might be tearing each others clothes off in a fit of passion
7115304 i know youd rather be out there with my other self instead of being stuck with me
7115305 i could think of no better person to be stuck with
7115306 well if they havent passed out first or forgotten about us
7115307 i shouldnt have left my sonic in my coat pocket
7115308 well it is and it isnt my tenth self woke up with a splitting headache and i never knew what went on
7115309 it means you never told my tenth self what happened in here and if you told any of the others they never said anything to me
7115310 me nah im just formulating a plan to get us out of here
7115311 reminds me of the time we were caught in lazarus machine
7115312 and your dress of course you look lovely in whatever you wear but
7115313 yes well i cant tell you the reason for that just yet besides youll find out soon enough anyway
7115314 i know timelines you cant blame me for trying though
7115315 we can stop right now if you want and the timeline will be safe
7115316 to hell with the timeline besides whats to say this isnt what happens anyway
7115317 id never regret this and you martha could never look a fright
7115318 we better get dressed because who knows when were going to be let out
7115319 guess well be getting out of here sooner rather than later
7115320 not if you dont want it to be but i must warn you that ill probably be leaving soon
7115321 id love to take you into my tardis but my tenth self would not appreciate it if i did
7115322 um i mean can we find a bed and then stay in it
7115323 martha jones jack really has been a bad influence on you
7115324 in bed when i saw her last i mean she was heading that way spending all night in a tiny cupboard is really uncomfortable
7115325 i i wasnt i was just checking you were okay
7115326 aww dont pout at me you my dear tenth self really need to lighten up a little
7115327 i feel like youve come in and stole my martha away from me
7115328 look just tell her how you feel i cant take her with me anyway itd cause a paradox the size of your ego if i did
7115329 i cant im afraid that ill lose her just like i lost gallifrey
7115330 put simply youre not the last time lord any more
7115331 youre a tease dropping all these future hints but not explaining them
7115332 you know as well as i do if i told you the whole story things may go differently
7115333 there was one mystery that always bugged me but its been solved now
7115334 if i told you it wouldnt be a mystery now would it
7115335 also dont forget that huge stonking paradox that it would cause
7115336 so once the others are awake any ideas on where to take them
7115337 i know theyd say about somewhere about not having to run for their lives but wheres the fun in that
7115338 cant we have one quiet trip in which we are not running for our lives and getting all mucky
7115339 id stay at home curled up with a cup of tea and an episode of midsomer murders
7115340 and when did we end up talking about them anyway
7115341 not done the paw on the leg thing yet though
7115342 good thing too or hed get a rolled up newspaper on his nose
7115343 rose must be baby spice being the youngest of us all
7115344 uh well shes my one of my companions i notice these things
7115345 yeah when she was cloned i when i was you knew it wasnt her straight off
7115346 what do you mean im not the last time lord any more
7115347 what stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all existence
7115348 thirteen can i talk to you for a moment alone
7115349 and if you cant be good be good at what you do
7115350 jack really is a bed um i mean bad influence on the two of you
7115351 is that directed to me or the thirteenth doctor did i hear something about bed doctor
7115352 you bottom feeders and your arrogance you think everybodys just trying to get in your knickers sounds like something you would say
7115353 and youre right but im just waiting for the right moment to say it
7115354 oh i know its the quote that begins with actually you were the last isnt it
7115355 you cant let my tenth self know any of this he needs to discover it on his own
7115356 marthas a dear friend of mine if you hurt her
7115357 spare me the talk jack im not going to hurt her
7115358 i really care for her and i wouldnt dream of hurting her
7115359 she knows ill have to leave besides i wont be leaving her fully my tenth self will be here
7115360 yes well theres a lot you dont know about me
7115361 time lords are like onions we have many subtle layers
7115362 is that an offer for one of us to peel you
7115363 i havent told him everything i havent told him who my companions are and you know that if i told you all our future id have to wipe your memories so it doesnt alter history
7115364 its a long story and it definitely comes under the category of things to never to tell you
7115365 ah and i can see why you dont want two jacks in the same place
7115366 its been an exhausting day so im going to bed
7115367 im sure martha could make her own way to bed
7115368 what if she falls i dont want martha to fall and hurt herself
7115369 miss jones would you allow me to escort you to bed
7115370 um would you mind turning around so i can get changed
7115371 you just seem so comfortable with him but as hes me then thats inevitable your pyjamas are nice
7115372 once he gets his tardis back you cant go with him
7115373 and whether i love him or not is of no concern to you
7115374 i should go you need your sleep and ive kept you awake long enough
7115375 i wish i could tell you everything but i cant
7115376 oh stop being a whiny emo bitch and just tell her
7115377 you have to tell her sooner rather than later and remember to duck
7115378 well it didnt exactly happen like that but i cant tell you that
7115379 so i have to tell martha i care for her but not that youve dreamt of her
7115380 yes come on pick up the pace no more delays
7115381 yes and i wont tell you yet but youll find out very soon
7115382 martha jack is a bad influence on you what would my tenth self say
7115383 youre talking about sex at this time in the morning
7115384 seeing as hes a bad influence on her and everything she cant have meant you could she
7115385 i am not about to have a foursome with my older self and jack
7115386 not even as a distraction not even to save the world
7115387 in that unlikely situation in which the world depends on us snogging
7115388 youd be better off asking my younger self hes the designated driver im just the senior citizen
7115389 jack dont you know its rude to ask a time lord his age
7115390 so whats this dogma quote that you threatened to quote at martha
7115391 my tenth self is adamant about being the last but hes way off base
7115392 id know if i wasnt all i can pick up is my thirteenth self
7115393 ive been waiting to do that for a long time
7115394 yeah new york snow after its had millions of cars drive through it
7115395 what the hell have you been doing with my martha
7115396 dont be such a wuss you wont regenerate because of this
7115397 anyone would think that after one thousand years youd learn to land the tardis gently
7115398 oi im a ripe age of over ten thousand years old
7115399 well we arent anywhere near your parents house any more
7115400 were not going to be tied up and forced to shag for any aliens pleasure are we
7115401 donna if i was drinking then you wouldve been the cause of me possibly regenerating by choking
7115402 just because jack is still my companion in my time doesnt mean i go around shagging him
7115403 better not have spaceman ill smack you if youve impregnated me
7115404 i can promise you i havent done anything of the sort

7115422 i should have been in the finals its hard but im happy with the bronze its better than nothing i have two ways to look at it either succumb to it and think i should have been in the finals but a champion goes out there with dignity and i wanted to prove to myself and others that i am the best it encourages me to keep going
7115423 i am upset i love winning i hate losing and in no way does this discourage me from wanting to go to the 2012 olympic games
7115424 im sorry for being such a poor sport and im honored to take home a bronze medal for my country
7115425 we asked him the question what was he doing with the head of the pakistani isi general mahmoud ahmad

7115429 the bankruptcy bill is morally bankrupt and so is any senator who votes for it
7115430 so what does the bill do it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses

7115438 but theyve come to realize that in more instances than not it works to the benefit of the police officer substantiating what the officer testifies to
7115439 police have come to appreciate the technology it often proves to be decisive in criminal cases because it can refute what the defendant says
7115440 of course he might make spontaneous statements that may be admissible even if he has invoked miranda
7115441 the right that a defendant has is not the right to privacy but his 5th amendment right to not incriminate himself
7115442 but in general whether or not audio is being recorded is an agencys policy decision
7115443 each agency has to decide for themselves from our perspective we think an agency should encourage the audio and video recording of all traffic stops because it really does protect the officer
7115444 the audio can be very very important the audio can provide a lot information that the video camera cant
7115445 can be problematic for an agency especially if it does look like they are intentionally trying to hide something
7115446 the officers have to manually turn on their microphone which due to the situation may not get activated
7115447 there are dynamic circumstances that occur that are not captured policy indicates that an officer will make every reasonable effort to use the system
7115448 the use of the audio is more the norm than the exception
7115449 the officer may not want to audio record tactical conversations which may include victim or witness comments or details
7115450 only those associated with a active investigation and open records requests
7115451 i cant tell you how important these recordings are to protect the innocent but its also important for guilty people
7115452 usually the video without the audio would be good enough
7115453 in this case video wasnt enough weaving is not on the video
7115454 i just want police to use those machines its the best way to ensure justice

7115541 you look all over america able to choose the person other than yourself most fit to be president of the united states it is a primary with one voter and you can choose your own socrates since he need not win over the masses

7115558 normally in the linux world the way we respond to knowledge of a specific vulnerability is to patch the problem rather than scan for exploits

7115574 u2 mixed something passionate irish and dashing something a little starry eyed and roguish with the austere blazing british post punk sound that had emerged in january 1978 once johnny rotten had formed public imaged limited howard devoto had formed magazine and warsaw had become joy division
7115575 the boston paradise theatre show of march 1981 was a great triumph for the band it was out first show in the u s outside of a club and it was broadcast live on radio it was a very highly regarded live recording and we shamelessly exploited it as a source of b sides of which we always seemed to be short
7115576 this would be around the 10th american show for us and you can hear that we are all pretty high on ourselves we train wreck a couple of things and sometimes you wouldnt know that pianist mike garson was onstage with us but overall i really treasure this bootleg mick ronson is at his blistering best

7115592 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7115593 i barack am one of you obama know your pain
7115594 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
7115595 since having my own presidential seal made so many people mad this time lets just borrow from harley davidson
7115596 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated

7115607 obama reconheceu o lapso em seguran a nacional e a necessidade de bater mais forte em mccain e escolheu o sujeito que pode mais rapidamente ajud lo nas duas coisas
7115608 n o deveria haver d vida que de esta vai ser uma campanha dura daqui em diante e biden sabe lutar tenho certeza de que esse foi um fator de peso
7115609 esta uma admiss o da parte de barack obama de que ele n o tem experi ncia para ser presidente mais do que um vice presidente ele procura uma muleta ou um tutor

7115613 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7115614 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7115615 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7115616 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7115617 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7115618 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7115619 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7115620 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7115621 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7115622 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7115623 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7115624 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7115625 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7115626 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7115627 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7115628 our players look forward to the opportunity to interact with our fans and obviously its a bid day for them and a big day for our fans as well
7115629 parts of practice were really good and parts of it werent
7115630 we came out and did our no huddle stuff at the beginning of practice and didnt get the tempo we wanted so we came back to it after inside drill we got a lot of situations taught today
7115631 were giving the players all of tomorrow and monday off before we come back from a physical standpoint tuesday
7115632 i think that will show in their attitude as well because theyve been able to push through it very well during fall camp and the 23 practices weve had so far
7115633 everything pretty much has been geared toward the texas a amp m game the past couple of days so were full speed toward texas a amp m the offense runs plays off scout cards for our defense and the defense for our offense trying to give each other the best quality look that we can get
7115634 we dont want to peak tomorrow we want to peak next saturday and we still have some things we have to install and clean up on both sides of the ball as far as attitude were giving the players an opportunity to recover a little bit rest and do some things that normal college students do before we come back out and start that preparation again
7115635 obviously any division i athlete has a very difficult chore balancing the pressures of playing division i football or any sport for that matter and being a full time student
7115636 they have to manage their time extremely well and our guys have done a remarkable job in the classroom and we expect that to continue this year we wont practice monday so they can concentrate fully on school other than position meetings that well have other than that its just going to be a normal game week
7115637 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7115638 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7115639 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7115640 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7115641 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7115642 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change

7115693 scanning for exploits is always going to be a lost cause viz windows security and the ineffectiveness of the whole anti malware industry
7115694 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7115695 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7115696 get your man in line in the house if this comes out of the senate
7115697 back in 1990 and now seems intent on making it a reality
7115698 its those who loved him and believed him who are most hurt by this
7115699 medicine is scarce and there is only one doctor and a few nurses that shows how we are unable to cope
7115700 now the town is calm but we are still skeptical about the situation
7115701 the possibility of the defeated militia or any other troops challenging the islamic militia who are now in control of kismayo is not simple or realistic
7115702 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government
7115703 barbarians thats what they are they kill innocent people here how many kilometers miles outside the battlefield they bombed all over georgia
7115704 its hard to be in your own city and see someone elses soldiers roaming your streets i didnt sleep for 15 days
7115705 were trying to make things normal again but normalcy will only come when peoples souls are eased
7115706 i took only a foot and some of a torso i couldnt get the other bodies out
7115707 im an old man but i will return to abkhazia
7115708 russian georgians ossetians we should all be living in peace together like we did under stalin
7115709 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7115710 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7115711 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems
7115712 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7115713 you can say the man was still in his senses despite his injuries he couldnt speak but he communicated with gestures police captain herman ruben gab told telam news agency after he responded to an emergency call by the mans nephew who heard the shots
7115714 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7115715 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns
7115716 its amazing that an 11 year old kid would think of being involved in something like that
7115717 you come to do a burglary on a bus you do the burglary you take your guns and get back on the bus and go home

7115724 nothing could have saved joe but the care there was hateful and incompetent
7115725 the study has very little to do with their diagnosis and it is not consistent with what occurred
7115726 dr bergmann made it very clear to us that the benefit of signing up for the study would be that she would develop an individual profile of joe that would help them to arrive at a diagnosis faster
7115727 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7115728 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7115729 slipped with the truth that his own experience is too underwhelming to be president
7115730 repeat after me i do like asparagus turns out your taste preferences might not be as set as you thought a recent study by the universities of washington and california irvine questioned more than 400 people in two different studies about their food preferences and then provided phony feedback participants were lead to believe that hard boiled eggs amp pickles made them sick as children researches found that the suggestions could lead a person to later avoid those foods on the flip side a follow up study using about asparagus showed that the good memory made people want to eat more of that vegetable

7115733 u2 mixed something passionate irish and dashing something a little starry eyed and roguish with the austere blazing british post punk sound that had emerged in january 1978 once johnny rotten had formed public imaged limited howard devoto had formed magazine and warsaw had become joy division
7115734 the boston paradise theatre show of march 1981 was a great triumph for the band it was out first show in the u s outside of a club and it was broadcast live on radio it was a very highly regarded live recording and we shamelessly exploited it as a source of b sides of which we always seemed to be short
7115735 this would be around the 10th american show for us and you can hear that we are all pretty high on ourselves we train wreck a couple of things and sometimes you wouldnt know that pianist mike garson was onstage with us but overall i really treasure this bootleg mick ronson is at his blistering best
7115736 it is our most angry release to date continent is basically my absolute disgust towards everything the whole album is based on the concept of nihilism the world as we know it was a fluke and there is no meaning in anything it is about pulling yourself out of society because everything makes you sick

7115744 no faith in the objectivity or impartiality of the board
7115745 tied itself up in knots in attempting to explain its decision making process in deciding to grant this permission
7115746 which without in any way accepting the validity of any of the complaints made by the applicant will minimise the risk of further judicial review
7115747 that would provide a forum for all of the parties to place up to date information before the inspector and also to agitate any other questions considered appropriate
7115748 further consideration of this matter by the board be dealt with by members of it who have not had a previous involvement in the case
7115749 the most appropriate course would be to convene a meeting of all available board members ie those who participated previously and those who did not to decide the appeal
7115750 the exclusion of the five members who took the quashed decision would seriously weaken the level of experience and expertise that would be brought to bear
7115751 a major and significant infrastructural development which would in accordance with established practice within the board be decided at a board meeting involving the chairperson and deputy chairperson

7115758 whether one spends time in futile activities or fruitful activities time does not stand still when the one who spent his time in futility looks back in retrospect then he experiences nothing but regret
7115759 i think they were struggling between choosing a candidate would represent what barack obama represents change maybe thats somebody like tim kaine of virginia and somebody who represents is a known quantity who does have that kind of national security experience would be a reassurance
7115760 we werent trying to hide anything were pretty good at keeping secrets i have a feeling that most of the people who normally text were probably up and got it
7115761 over the course of the process they became convinced sen obama became convinced that they needed a candidate who would reassure voters on that support someone who that could count on who was a solid known quantity
7115762 what does barack obamas running mate say about barack obama
7115763 you said i think he can be ready but right now i dont think he is
7115764 i think thats the best they can do sen biden and a lot of other democrats questioning sen obamas experience clearly sen clinton did that of course in the primary
7115765 i actually asked about that exchange when he was on my show
7115766 but one of the reasons i think obama decided to go with biden in the end is not only because he has experience but is because he really can be a political gut biter and is a strong debater over the course of the debates during the primary he was often the winner of the debates
7115767 he has served with john mccain for an awful long time and i think the obama team believes that joe biden will have the ability to get under john mccains skin over the course of this campaign and to really be very forceful
7115768 i think john mccain has to figure out kind of does he want a reinforcing choice someone like a joe lieberman who has national security experience or does he want have someone who compliments his strengths maybe who has more experience on the economy maybe who is part of a different generation
7115769 that would lead perhaps to mitt romney who has strong economic credentials or maybe the governor of minnesota tim pawlenty whos under 50 and represents the next generation of republican leaders
7115770 joe biden is an outstanding public servant with deep experience and a fighting spirit these qualities will make him a great asset in the white house and on the campaign trail this fall
7115771 a tremendous leader and a great complement to sen obama and his candidacy
7115772 extensive experience dealing with foreign policy issues are an asset in these complicated times
7115773 a brief call to offer congratulations to the senator and his wife

7115789 the first thing that i would do is call in john kerry bob kerrey
7115790 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7115791 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7115792 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7115818 collections attorneys are an amazing group of professionals who take their job seriously
7115819 its not a matter of who can harass the consumer most its a matter of you owe money to our client that you should pay back
7115820 i was assuming id go to court go before a judge with all this documentation
7115821 many people tell us they didnt understand when they received the summons and complaint they didnt realize they were being sued
7115822 debt collectors have an uncanny ability to come up with the right address once it comes time to get the money but they have a hard time coming up with the right address when it comes time to serve the summons and complaint
7115823 its not as if all of a sudden out of the blue collectors say hey mr
7115824 i dont know what else we can do other than to make the default judgment papers pink
7115825 that back end piece where the burden is shifting back to the consumer to prove the money is exempt is unfair to the consumer
7115826 collectors need to adhere to the consumer protection laws that are already on the books in minnesota to ensure that they do not freeze or garnish exempt funds
7115827 it makes no sense to me that you can use the power of the state of minnesota to sue somebody without paying a fee to us and bringing it into court
7115828 our civil judges in hennepin county carry way over the national caseload
7115829 once youre in danger of losing money i think the court should be on top of it i think they need to stop rubber stamping
7115830 its scary because at this point you expect to be well set
7115831 theres also growing concern just about paying for everyday items like food and energy and peoples 401 k s are not what they were two years ago so they want to keep working and putting money into them
7115832 my family on my fathers side lived into their 100s so im preparing for 100
7115833 but im on four medications now which i will be for the rest of my life so health care is a big economic factor for me
7115834 like a lot of people we have a lot of our assets tied up in a house that is bigger than we need but were unable to sell
7115835 that means caring for mom and dad may hurt the childrens finances
7115836 i was always going to have as much fun as i could but i never thought that we would be a burden to them
7115837 some advice i was given when i was 20 years old in 1959 was to save something out of every paycheck having it invested before i ever saw it
7115838 put our children through college helped us purchase a home and gave us retirement income
7115839 confronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words we venture the following motto margin of safety
7115840 weve taken the same quality of money management and the same compensation system that the rich have always had access to and weve brought it to regular people hardworking americans
7115841 at the time i was really upset about it but in hindsight its the best thing that ever happened
7115842 in life there are some things where brand name means something in the world of mutual funds there are lots of undiscovered gems

7115847 if you have a fund that returns 3 percent if you lose 1 5 percent from the mutual funds administrative fee and 1 5 percent from the adviser you effectively get no return from that fund
7115848 the increase is largely due to the shift by advisers toward more highly customized solutions
7115849 the idea that they can help you pick outperforming funds consistently long term for their 150 basis points 1 5 percent i think is totally bogus and is misleading the public
7115850 i make more verbal mistakes than g w has in a lifetime
7115851 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7115852 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7115853 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7115854 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7115855 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7115856 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while

7115867 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man
7115868 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him

7115870 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it

7115873 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come

7115914 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7115915 we could have the lord almighty be nominated and someone in this country will communicate to the committee something negative about that person
7115916 if we do nothing theres a serb victory and the continuation of genocide
7115917 if we do what you want we only have two options
7115918 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7115919 today is a special day we hope its the beginning we have opened the path and we hope there will be more travellers
7115920 in order to avoid a well publicised provocation in the middle of the sea
7115921 because we know who is on the boats and what they contain we will allow them to land
7115922 the arrival of the two ships after this adventure represents a big breakthrough in the wall of the israeli siege imposed on gaza
7115923 the journey was long and hard we had a lot of rough weather out of cyprus a lot of people got sick but it was worth it
7115924 the beginning of an end to the siege only if other organisations and friendly countries allow people to sail towards gaza
7115925 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7115926 things to do when you just cant watch any more law and order reruns
7115927 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year

7115934 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7115935 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right
7115936 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7115937 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7115938 now that the situation is changing in iraq they are heading to a new front which is the one in afghanistan
7115939 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7115940 in military terms i think we the french are pretty tough
7115941 our normal reaction to losing people is not to sit down and cry and then rush to the exits that is not the french way
7115942 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7115943 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7115944 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7115945 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7115946 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7115947 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7115948 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7115949 eu e rupert nos damos muito bem ele um cara ador vel um cara completamente bem falado o que realmente bom nesse filme para ele que o mostra como adulto ele parece muito crescido em compara o aos filmes de harry potter ele est fazendo um trabalho fant stico

7115961 olympia 2008 has been an enormous cultural misunderstanding the west and the ioc had hoped for a joyous peoples festival fest der v lker symbolized by chinas opening i e to the world the communist party rulers wanted to publicize their kingdom as a new imperturbable world power
7115962 somehow artificially bloodlessly and sterilely work on us tv viewers as grey as the skies over peking

7115970 a man with a distinguished record a man with a fundamental decency and that man is joe biden
7115971 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7115972 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7115973 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7115974 im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7115975 folks we come from very different places but we share a common story an american story
7115976 he was the son of a single mom a single mom that had to struggle to support her son and her kid
7115977 i was an irish catholic kid with a father like many of yours in tough economic times and fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe my dad repeated it its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7115978 ladies and gentlemen that is your story that is americas story its about if you get up you can make it
7115979 were very pleased that rheem recognizes our hard work and dedication to quality honesty and personalized service
7115980 we flat out love rheem products theyre the most dependable and high quality heating air conditioning and indoor air quality products on the market and this is supported by the highest ratings in consumer reports
7115981 so how then could winston have reimbursed henry for the 40 000 when he didnt even know that henry had paid the bill for him
7115982 a practitioner must not receive a reward whether financial or otherwise of which a client is unaware in respect of services rendered to the client
7115983 a practitioner must not directly or indirectly offer to or receive from a third party a reward or inducement whether financial or otherwise in respect of services rendered or to be rendered to the client
7115984 is it right for a barrister to receive 100 000 from a third party where there has never been a fee note rendered to the solicitor instructing him
7115985 i would have thought the law society would have real concerns about that
7115986 were going to the worst places in christchurch my husband has always said it is not a matter of if it is a matter of when
7115987 weve picked up thousands of cats for them but they wont give us a penny
7115988 our compassion compels us to do this work because we know if we dont get these cats then people will kill them themselves
7115989 obviously tenants may contact volunteer organisations without housing new zealands knowledge it is however our preference that tenants contact us directly
7115990 there are a lot of very angry people out there who mistreat their animals and we deal with some pretty scary situations one time i was feeling fearful of fronting up to some people and getting their cat and kerry said that she would do it she was willing to front up to anyone to save those cats
7115991 we also coined the term yellow peril and we still think we know better than china how it should run its own affairs
7115992 were very pleased that rheem recognizes our hard work and dedication to quality honesty and personalized service
7115993 we flat out love rheem products theyre the most dependable and high quality heating air conditioning and indoor air quality products on the market and this is supported by the highest ratings in consumer reports
7115994 theres going to be a big problem sending them college guys theres going to be a big problem you look over at these guys croatians lithuanian s you send them college guys over here its going to be a problem
7115995 there are a number of high profile cases in which three or four areas of legislation are exposed such as bail and parole decisions that have failed people
7115996 some said we would be skating on thin ice but no one said we would actually be in breach of the act
7115997 we decided if it was that murky that its hard for anyone to make a decision wed run with a campaign and wait for officials to come to us
7115998 it would be a pretty brave government who would take a victim to court
7115999 it would be the best promotion we could ever get people are irate about this act they want the freedom to have their voice heard
7116000 i can give you some general guidance along with the recommendation that you obtain your own independent advice as well
7116001 unhelpfully vague in a number of important respects including the definition of an election advertisement
7116002 we havent got the financial resources to mount a legal challenge if we press ahead
7116003 implicates the right to freedom of expression under section 14 of the bill of rights in several respects
7116004 consider it prudent to rely on the possibility of a court reaching such a conclusion
7116005 we would have all kinds of administration things to add on and there are huge questions over whether the charities commission would then regard organisations like ours as a political lobby group
7116006 i think i wanted to learn about my father the same way he did
7116007 he came here searching for his roots and i was also trying to find my roots

7116059 until philosophers intellectuals bear rule states and individuals will have no rest from evil
7116060 the distinction between an intellectual and a politician is an unintelligent one intellectuals and politicians go together because politics that is not driven by intellectuals is not powerful
7116061 although he has ambition it is hollow ambition which is not clothed in any greater understanding and intellectual appreciation
7116062 i dont think we should be talking quietly here in the band hall he might have some good hearing
7116063 i want to hear you say hit and one hit and one hit and one

7116073 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7116074 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7116075 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7116076 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7116077 we could have the lord almighty be nominated and someone in this country will communicate to the committee something negative about that person
7116078 if we do nothing theres a serb victory and the continuation of genocide
7116079 if we do what you want we only have two options
7116080 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7116081 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7116082 get your man in line in the house if this comes out of the senate
7116083 our culture is still here we want our children to know what their roots are
7116084 this event also brings us together with the community as one unit
7116085 india and the united states have had a deep and profound relationship
7116086 now we americans and indians are going to be the vanguard of democracy of the whole world
7116087 curtail criminal activity and lessen its economic and political power
7116088 my investigation revealed that from 2004 to 2007 these three persons acted in concert as a criminal enterprise to authorize receive or approve the transfer of funds from rlshs account without following basic standard operating procedures and accounting principles in addition the transfers were not properly authorized by rlshs board and contrary to law

7116095 the irb estimate was this will cost us 3 million
7116096 it is a small cost to pay to keep our small businesses from the court of bankruptcy
7116097 there are additional charges that will be filed shortly against mr miller
7116098 right now it has to be trucked eight miles from cruz bay
7116099 energy and water issues are those that are most affecting our residents
7116100 there is no doubt in my mind that the greatest natural resource on st john is not the national park but our children
7116101 stay the course youve got to be kidding this is america not the damned titanic ill give you a sound bite throw the bums out
7116102 it carries immense responsibility and is a great opportunity to serve the virgin islands in a very unique way
7116103 a blanket prohibition as exhibited in this legislation is counter productive
7116104 access to edc benefits leads these businesses to have an unfair advantage over land based taxis
7116105 the business closed because the government had not paid for the work that silcott had done
7116106 the past and continuing failure of the leac rate to recover the authoritys fuel cost fully and timely has caused a significant deterioration in the authoritys fiscal and financial position which has assumed crisis proportions
7116107 if we dont address this situation and make hard decisions we dont need a hurricane hovensa will be the hurricane
7116108 were really happy that we have the full support of the senate on this issue
7116109 weve taken the total number of money in the bill and reprogrammed just a few of them
7116110 we included more money for wapa to cover almost all outstanding bills by the central government within a hundred thousand dollars to include because we thought it was so important juan f luis hospitals water bill and electric bill and for roy l schneider medical center
7116111 under mr neaves leadership the university expects to meet and surpass fundraising goals
7116112 most importantly the university hopes to cultivate long lasting relationships with partners in the virgin islands the caribbean the nation and the world

7116121 same as they were the earth kingdom is busy rebuilding with help from the water and fire nation everything will be back to normal there soon
7116122 hehe nothing its just funny you saying nice things it just seems so forced
7116123 yes well niceness wasnt something i experienced much of during the war concern and trust and all the emotions you throw around are well were considered a sign of weakness by my father and other soldiers you had to scare people into respecting you soldiers wouldnt respect someone who was weak let alone a weak female leader
7116124 well its a good thing youve changed i like the new azula
7116125 ill just let that slide but you really make it too easy avatar
7116126 you leave in a week youre to be transported to omashu by a fire nation ship next monday im sorry azula
7116127 oh well we both knew it was coming cant stop the inevitable i suppose
7116128 we arent havent been since the festival after ozais execution
7116129 what happened if you dont mind my asking that is
7116130 well she pulled me aside during the festival and started apologizing i couldnt really hear her because of the loud music so i was kind of lost but she started talking about zuko and how she was in love with him then she started apologizing again i was dumbfounded needless to say i just kind of said okay and walked away at first i was really angry at katara and zuko for stealing her from me but then i realized that love wasnt something you could force on someone it was their destiny so i just kind of accepted it i still try to avoid being around katara if i can but avoiding zuko was impossible seeing as how i have to mediate between the leaders of the nations eventually he apologized to me as well but i told him i didnt have any hard feelings me and him are actually kind of best friends funny how that works not long before he was hell bent on killing me haha
7116131 well this was nice as usual but ive got to go there are some rogue fire nation soldiers that have been causing a ruckus and ive gotta go teach them a lesson
7116132 of course ive actually got a little surprise for you
7116133 cmon get up princess time to go for a ride
7116134 so princess you ready to meet the same fate your father did
7116135 i asked you a question princess i expect an answer
7116136 you know boys weve still got some time before the ships due to leave what do ya say we have a little fun your looking rather attractive
7116137 besides i dont think the avatar would take too kindly to you hurting me before we reach our destination now would he
7116138 oh my god what the hell is that ahhh take that you freak
7116139 giving you your surprise of course i thought it was obvious
7116140 aang you cant just break me out of here did you even stop to think of the consequences
7116141 ugh they will come looking for me zuko might not but i know the leaders of the earth nation will we will only be delaying the inevitable
7116142 you worry too much azula im the avatar and youre the smart and cunning azula of the fire nation im sure well figure something out
7116143 well are you going to get these cuffs off me or not avatar
7116144 finally you have no idea how incredibly uncomfortable those things are
7116145 i dont mean to rush you but we kind of need to hurry before they wake back up
7116146 ahh it feels so good to be out of there the air was so foul
7116147 dont worry about it if it wasnt for you id still be on my way to my death so im forever grateful for what youve done how ever stupid it might have been
7116148 wheres that flying bison of yours i dont see him anywhere
7116149 oh i didnt bring him i didnt want to announce to the entire ship who i was figured itd be best if we didnt give away who broke you out if that were the case we really wouldnt have a chance
7116150 well i had to lets just say liberate an unused water nation sub the machinist had built a few more than we needed during the day of the black sun so i figured id take one for a spin maybe save a damsel in distress on the way
7116151 water bending of course all you gotta do is control the water around the ship and you can go up down however fast you want its pretty ingenious really
7116152 the first models has some problem storing air but the mechanist revised the construction a bit we can stay under for quiet awhile now
7116153 ahh yes he is the one that invented the war balloons correct
7116154 an island close by weve gotta find appa then from there the western air temple
7116155 well its sort of where i live now really i had to rebuild a bit of it of course sparky sparky boom man as sokka would say destroyed quiet a bit of it in his attempt to kill us but before that i thought it was really pretty its my favorite temple and i figure they all belong to me anyways seeing as how im the last air bender i might as well settle down at one of them
7116156 im sorry aang about your people and what the fire nation has done
7116157 dont worry about it you didnt kill us all off and besides im still here so that means hope isnt completely lost ill bring back the air benders somehow
7116158 and ill help you with whatever it is you do though not like i have much of a choice
7116159 i think we wont have much to worry about at the temple them you know finding you even if they suspect me of doing it they dont really know where i stay you should be safe i obviously wont be able to stay with you the whole time im still the avatar and if i vanished that would be extremely suspicious
7116160 god damn aang i almost killed you again can you give me a warning before you start blasting things to hell
7116161 sorry azula just had to get rid of the evidence wont happen again i promise
7116162 i know one thing i loved during my training to defeat ozai and all the running we did was the sights places like this really kept my spirits up when i was losing hope i fought for peoples lifes yes but another part of it was so all the pretty places id been too wouldnt end up in ash the fire nation was so destructive fire itself is a destructive force the misguided can cause and did cause so much damage with it
7116163 your right fire isnt the most forgiving of elements its angry if not properly controlled but at the same time it is a beautiful element and can be used for good in the right persons hands
7116164 mhmm very true beautiful and dangerous kind of like you
7116165 are you hungry i figure weve still got a little while before anyone starts actually looking for you and well im starving
7116166 we should leave soon we cant stay this close to long
7116167 how long do you think itll take to get there
7116168 well ive never really been fond of flying ive ridden in the war balloons before just wasnt my thing i guess you could say
7116169 toph was the same way well sort of she didnt like not being able to see you know she saw with her feet so in the air she felt pretty helpless but eventually she actually started to love riding appa so im sure you will as well
7116170 i told you youd like it those bulky balloons are nothing compared to a sky bison
7116171 do you ever miss katara i mean you say you avoid her do you miss seeing her
7116172 i guess in a way i do she was a great friend we were really close as well i could tell her anything and she would listen she was comforting and kind and truly a beautiful girl all these things are why i fell in love with her she was something else you know i couldnt help but not think about her not miss her miss us but shes with zuko now me and her were over i had my chance and i guess i failed im glad shes happy and ive forgiven her and zuko but still i cant help but feel jealousy when i see zuko even when i see sokka or toph i cant help but think of katara because we all journeyed together it makes me think about our time together the journey to defeat the fire lord all we went through i kind of fell into a depression at first after that night i left for awhile i didnt want to see my friends i didnt want any part of their sympathy i just wanted to forget about her and i knew theyd apologize and tell me things would be okay but they wouldnt she was mine and zuko took her from me thats all i could think about eventually i realized i was wrong and that he didnt take her but still it was devastating shortly after that was when i started visiting you actually im not even entirely sure why i did but im glad i did weve become great friends haha and now were convicts on the loose well you are anyways funny how things work destiny is a weird thing
7116173 a few landmarks and the fact that ive flown here so many times eventually you just kind of get a feel for where something is things start looking and smelling familiar like the air the air here is much more clean unlike that of the fire nations the fire nation smells like ash and sulfur if your close enough to one of the many volcanoes
7116174 this is where youll be staying while were here which could be for awhile
7116175 outside to be honest i find myself sleeping out there more often than in here anyways the nights here are incredibly beautiful and peaceful
7116176 make yourself at home ive gotta go back out for now though im sure by now they know of your escape and ive got to go see how serious they are about it i should be back sometime tomorrow im pretty sure youll be safe here till then
7116177 before you go i just wanted to say thanks for what youve done for me
7116178 it was no problem i mean besides the world wouldnt be the same without the queen of all cranky fire bending females
7116179 leave it to you to ruin a happy moment sigh you better leave before this cranky fire bender decides to burn you to a crisp
7116180 hey hey theres no need for that ill just be going now
7116181 well i ought to go see you soon appa yip yip
7116182 hey azula isnt this outfit sweet i feel like a ninja
7116183 aw come on now i thought it was pretty funny
7116184 well yeah actually haha you should have seen your face it was priceless
7116185 yeah maybe but if i was like you then wed have a serious problem with boredom i keep things exciting
7116186 ah pretty bad the earth nation is outraged they are accusing the fire nation of being weak not being able to hold onto one prisoner etc etc etc long story short they are sending a pretty massive search party of earth and fire benders to find you and on top of that a rogue band of ex fire nation soldiers have begun attacking small villages and outposts in the earth kingdom from the sounds of it they are a pretty big army saying something about the fire nation will return to power again or something to that effect citizens of the fire nation are starting to agree with the rogues and their cause their leader is quit charismatic zuko doesnt know what do the earth nation army is still pretty weak from the war but they are trying to hold them off as well as they can but my help is going to be needed they actually tried to recruit me in finding you but i told them i thought stopping an army was more important than going on a manhunt i tried to convince them of the same thing but they wouldnt have it its like they think their troubles will all end if your gone i dont get it
7116187 it seems things will never change its like people dont want peace i dont get it
7116188 everything will be fine you can defeat these rogues and when that happens the people of the fire nation will realize their beliefs are flawed and everything will fall back into place
7116189 itll all be fine youll fix everything im sure of it
7116190 but whats the point i dont even think its worth it after all ive done nothings changed people are still hurting other people and i think well i think thats how itll always be its like they get enjoyment out of the suffering of others even if i stop this war another ones sure to come eventually most of the avatars have had to deal with war what difference does it make if i try to stop this one or not another one will come its only a matter of time its a hopeless venture people are ignorant
7116191 sorry about that its just things are starting to get to me i guess im starting to realize the truth that there will always be bad people and nothing i can do will stop it just fighting one man cant change a hundred years of war and the people that took part in it and im just now realizing that but i have to be strong and fight for the people that cant fight back thats my job and ill do it without hesitation im going to stop them although i will need help even the avatar cant take on a battalion of elite troops by himself
7116192 youll be coming with me and i think i might pick up an old friend or two along the way
7116193 how exactly can i go theyll recognize me for sure
7116194 not if youre a ninja did you think i got this for me haha silly
7116195 theres no way your getting me to wear that hideous excuse for an outfit
7116196 aww your no fun do you honestly want to be cooped up here the rest of your life
7116197 ugh this better be worth it and if i get caught its your fault
7116198 well before we actually head out i think we should train a bit can you fire bend regular fire like you know not blue itll give you away and we dont want that
7116199 of course i can its just not as hot as the blue fire and well i go for whatevers the most powerful
7116200 well lets go a round or two i know you havent exactly been able to bend a lot during your prison time oh and you might not want to use your lightening either seeing as how your one of the only fire benders that can also a big give away
7116201 you have no idea how good it feels to bend again not being able too well its made me feel empty like im not myself its hard to explain
7116202 wow for someone who hasnt really bended in over a year your doing pretty good although i think your aim with lightening has faltered a bit
7116203 nope nope my mistake hah i dont feel like dying twice thanks
7116204 we can leave now if youd like the sooner the better we have to stop at gaoling and pick up toph then we can start our search for these bandits reports say they appear to be making camp somewhere in the earth kingdom which would make sense seeing as how the earth kingdom is all theyve attacked so far toph will most likely recognize you seeing as how she cant see with eyes you cant exactly disguise your stature and internal movements but i trust her i know she wouldnt tell anyone
7116205 im just going to go grab a few things from inside ill be right back
7116206 this should last us awhile we might want to get more in gaoling before we start the search though
7116207 we still have a couple hours why dont you take a nap or something
7116208 a minute at most im going to stear appa in the direction of that large group of fighters there
7116209 when we get over them were going to jump off and give them what they have coming
7116210 okay were getting close now get ready to jump on my mark
7116211 can we have this conversation after we arent getting viciously attacked
7116212 hey youre the avatar arent you youre the one that took down our leader youre going to die
7116213 we wish to finish what the fire nation started and we wont stop until all bow to the power of the fire nation
7116214 i suggest you answer him trust me when i say you dont want to see him angry
7116215 fine have it your way but trust me when i say your not going to like my partners interrogation techniques
7116216 oh and how is it you plan to subdue us as far as i can tell we still have you out numbered
7116217 thats the 2nd mistake youve made today never underestimate the avatar
7116218 couldnt have done it better myself aang you do me proud
7116219 oh dont worry about it hey you guys round these suckers up and put them in a holding cell until we can get around to interrogating them
7116220 you dont have to be so nervous im not going to turn you in or something
7116221 so i heard whatever attacked the ship made quick work of all the guards
7116222 now now aang lets not get to cocky the guards werent exactly the most experienced
7116223 of course we cant go and let you get a big head now can we
7116224 youre my type of gal not afraid to tell it how it is katara on the other hand she is way to gentle
7116225 speaking of katara have you seen her lately aang i havent heard anything from her in awhile
7116226 no although i think shes been busy helping zuko out with all the paperwork and things that go along with being the firelord apparently its pretty stressful
7116227 nope went away for awhile something to have to do with meeting with some other rich family i didnt really pay attention
7116228 nope after i returned and they learned about my help in the defeat of the fire nation they just kind of figured i could take care of myself which i can so im pretty happy here now
7116229 aang you do realize this is pretty serious right what you did
7116230 yeah i know but i had too shes a really good friend now and shes changed i wasnt about to let her die
7116231 yes i know im extremely grateful for what he did for me
7116232 oh nothing so what brings you to these parts aang
7116233 well as youve obviously seen ex fire nation soldiers are attacking earth nation cities and are gaining more and more support in the fire nation each day if we dont put a stop to it their could be revolt and if one of these guys became king that would present a major problem for the rest of the world
7116234 ahh so you came for the greatest earth bender evers help right
7116235 of course im always up for an adventure plus itll be nice to get out of gaoling again ever since i traveled with you being here makes me bored its just not the same after youve been all over the world
7116236 yes well try being trapped in a small cell for a year then well talk
7116237 true that sister i feel for you but you didnt exactly give them a choice
7116238 i know i wasnt normal when they put me there but because of aang ive changed
7116239 no lies there and you havent tried to kill us yet that alones enough to make me believe you
7116240 so now that thats cleared up that just leaves the little matter of interrogating our prisoners whos up for it
7116241 i think azula should do it she can get pretty damn scary sometimes
7116242 eh it shouldnt be too hard i doubt their as tough as they think they are give me 30 minutes and ill have your information and as for that last bit you better watch your back
7116243 well alright then lets go ill take you to the cells now
7116244 that was awfully easy i expected more of a challenge out of that one oh well he says they have a few camps set up on the outskirts of the earth nation their army is over a thousand strong and he doesnt even know their leaders name just that he was all powerful and would become the new phoenix king guess hes as crazy as my father was
7116245 this is not what i thought it was like at all
7116246 i cant believe ive lost so much weight since i came here
7116247 thinks like all of my friends do and we never consider anything else

7116253 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president

7116256 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7116257 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7116258 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7116259 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7116260 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7116261 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7116262 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7116263 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected

7116280 i listen to them for the music itself and not so much about what they have to say i like the way they put their music together
7116281 i dont think their lyrics are that bad as many people would think heavy metal music needs a strong minded person and if you are not then youll find yourself doing funny things
7116282 they arent exactly guys that i would say are living dangerously it also depends on the person because you cant say this song is going to make me kill someone unless you have an interest from something else
7116283 its difficult to prove that a specific thing has a certain influence but my experience with teenagers is that the more they are exposed to certain things in the media the more they regard those things as the norm
7116284 if they are exposed to a lot of violence or exposed to some of the ideas that come out of the music then they think that is how people should behave
7116285 music can trigger emotional response but its not to say a person has to go and act out that response

7116295 she said she was proud of me and i am very proud of her fowles said
7116296 she told me how much better i got and how she loves the way i work i just tried to model what she does

7116314 we need to find low tech ways to come together and participate in singing not just listening often the simplest things like singing are the most effective anyone can invite some friends over put on a cd of mantras and chant together the idea is to use the chants to bring ourselves into meditation
7116315 the true purpose of our music is to awaken a longing in the heart for that which is omnipresent the experience of silence and meditation its not about entertainment it is simply our spiritual practice
7116316 we always raise an eyebrow anytime theres a cluster of anything but these cases are not connected there is no information so far that theres anything in the world for anybody in the community to be concerned about regarding these cases
7116317 theres no reason why women in the community should think of leaving the community or going to outside doctors or hospitals
7116318 when it comes to infant mortality even if it is unavoidable it is a personal tragedy for the family and our caregivers take that very personally
7116319 if its something that theyre doing at the hospital i dont want that to happen to my baby you know youre pregnant for nine months and then you lose your baby thats crazy i want to know if its something they could have prevented
7116320 ive looked over whats been going on and i see absolutely no pattern we have seen examples of each and every one of those causes but nothing environmental
7116321 a lot of these fetal deaths did not occur in the hospital they just delivered here but the fetus died prior even to arrival at the hospital
7116322 one thing is true is its becoming more and more common that when theres a loss theyre listing the loss in the paper years ago people wouldnt be listing the death of a 31 week old pre term baby
7116323 do i feel that this is a safe place to have a baby absolutely the vast majority of deliveries go very well and when those deaths occur its a tragedy for the family and our hearts go out to the families

7116326 and wherever you went with the beatles thered be some sort of press conference with people asking the most inane questions
7116327 it was inspired by a dream i had about the beatles being ripped to shreds by all these young girls when they came out of a stadium
7116328 they werent allowed off that yacht until about 4am so do you really think theyre going to rush off to have breakfast with mrs marcos
7116329 it was very very humid and they were nothing like as happy as they were in japan but they performed brilliantly there
7116330 at the airport we were all jostled shoved pushed and it was carry your own bags theres no porters for you it upset the beatles a great deal
7116331 when we were on the plane waiting to take off there was complete silence in the first class cabin we didnt know whether we were all going to be dragged off and slung into prison when the engines started up and we were finally in the air there was such elation among all of us to get out of that f hole

7116345 consumers need to be able to communicate in a safe environment with debt collectors
7116346 debt collectors are required by federal law and have been since 1977 to treat you the same way the wal mart greeter treats you with truth fairness dignity and respect
7116347 this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose
7116348 very very real need for debt collectors to take the publics perception of the industry very seriously
7116349 and he looks as if he has had a ski accident because he is all bandaged up with all his wounds but its a miracle he is alive and i do thank god for that
7116350 he was very unlucky that a storm blew in and washed out all the tracks
7116351 he had to find a place to sleep in the dark hes had a terrible ordeal
7116352 i dont know what im going to do when they get to the white house
7116353 hes a family person hes friendly with everybody when he speaks he speaks the truth
7116354 obama after all isnt having trouble with african american voters or hispanic voters or young voters where hes lagging is among white voters and with older ones in particular call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
7116355 what makes obamas task of scoring white votes at kerry gore levels so formidable is to put it bluntly racial prejudice
7116356 whats clear however is that among older less educated white voters there is a pronounced albeit inchoate unease with obamas otherness
7116357 but they also strike me as insufficient responses to the race fueled angst that obamas candidacy has stirred up and that the mccain campaign plans artfully viciously to exacerbate in the weeks ahead
7116358 the reigning cliche of this election year that we are in uncharted waters here without either map or compass has never been more apt than when it comes to the question of race
7116359 would it really seem strange from that vantage point if the first black major party nominee a guy with a thin resume no foreign policy credentials in an era scarred by terrorism a background alien to much of wonder bread america and the full name barak hussein obama lost

7116373 ive always enjoyed the challenge of the short par 4s and most of them are great risk reward holes
7116374 so its not a bad thing to hit wedges into a par 4 every now and then its not a bad thing to have a birdie hole you dont have to just beat us up every hole
7116375 i think that weve gotten in this mode in the tournaments that we play where
7116376 even though we might shoot one or two more under par to win than we would normally i dont see why thats a bad thing i think its been a real plus i like what the trend has now been to have a greater mixture of holes
7116377 the difference is that i just know that if im patient it will eventually turn
7116378 you know we all go through these spells where youre playing well but youre not getting out of it what you want i feel like if im just patient enough eventually it will turn

7116414 well talk about that this week and try to figure out the best plan how to if we can utilize it productively we will and if we cant we wont so well just have to see how that goes and try to decide whats the most efficient way to do it

7116436 rogers group has applied for a conditional use permit to secure access to additional reserves at its facility on burnt knob road in rutherford county
7116437 the quarry produces crushed stone used in the construction of homes roads schools and sidewalks
7116438 the conditional use permit will allow operation beyond that time access to the property in question will allow rogers group to develop the quarry while minimizing its effect on surrounding areas
7116439 sometimes when you go in youll follow maybe three or four trucks and ive been behind as many as six dump trucks getting another load from the quarry
7116440 weve talked with the developers and theyre willing to make road improvements to help with the traffic out there
7116441 in cooperation with commissioner steve sandlin rogers group has agreed to donate the materials and labor necessary to improve the road saving the rutherford county taxpayers in excess of 750 000
7116442 if this quarry wasnt here from the very beginning where would these 23 workers be the answer is very simple they would be working elsewhere

7116467 some people think the options are shock and awe heavy military option or cut and run just go home but the third option is more like snatch and grab its when you identify the targets through good intelligence and sourcing it out and then you surgically strike those targets and consistently try to take the specific terrorist cells out

7116482 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7116483 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7116484 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7116485 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7116486 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7116488 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
7116489 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7116490 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7116491 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7116492 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome

7116499 when a parliamentary or social majority decrees that it is legal at least under certain conditions to kill unborn human life is it not really making a tyrannical decision with regard to the weakest and most defenseless of human beings in the case of an intrinsically unjust law such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia it is therefore never licit to obey it or to take part in a propaganda campaign in favour of such a law or vote for it the moral gravity of procured abortion is apparent in all its truth if we recognize we are dealing with murder

7116577 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7116578 felipes going to be hard to beat tomorrow but well certainly push for it
7116579 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as were on a street course anything is possible in the race
7116580 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me

7116612 the gold market started out weak on friday morning but after an early morning slide prices managed to recover and for a short period of time the gold futures managed to regain the 200 day moving average however residual strength in the dollar and a slight decline in overall financial sector anxiety in the us markets seemed to prompt a profit taking setback in gold and other flight to quality instruments in fact even the crude oil market came down sharply in what seemed to be a flight to quality liquidation perhaps soothing comments from the us fed chairman and upbeat us dialogue from warren buffet simply prompted an exodus from gold in the end seeing the us equity market manage a sharp rise for a large portion of the trading session clearly seemed to shake out as a negative for the gold market
7116613 thursdays gains again prove golds role as a hedge against inflation as well as periods of economic unrest and geopolitical tension
7116614 while further short covering could boost gold in the coming sessions we would look for technical resistance to emerge around 845
7116615 fundamentals remain in golds favor but after the damage of the last several weeks it will take trading within a range and a little time before gold can move back up convincingly

7116668 on the 3400 block of hollencrest road the real estate bust has turned this neighborhood of 1970s single story houses into a checkerboard of browned lawns and plywood covered windows every other house entered foreclosure over the last year francisco lopez will soon join the growing number of former homeowners
7116669 lopez purchased his house for 379 000 with no money down in november 2005 the exact month real estate prices in the county peaked according to standard amp poors case shiller home price index he calls it his lucky month with a wry smile he missed his first payment in march after his loan payment jumped beyond what he could afford

7116672 but last week lopez looked on the brighter side before whenever you looked for a parking spot you couldnt find one now there are spaces everywhere he said
7116673 those waiting for the lagging housing market to rebound were disappointed yesterday as mda dataquick reported that 2 004 san diego county homes went into foreclosure in july a 9 percent increase over the previous month and a spike of nearly 213 percent over last year
7116674 the july tally of mortgage failures was a record since dataquick began tracking foreclosures in 1988 it was the countys 40th consecutive month of year over year increases in both foreclosures and notices of default
7116675 prices are going down a lot of people find it easier to walk away from their mortgages than fighting to stay in the house said alan gin economist for the burnham moores center for real estate at the university of san diego
7116676 if the rate of new condo sales in downtown san diego continues the way it did in the first half of 2008 it would take five years and three months to sell all of the new units in the city core according to recent sales counts from marketpointe realty advisors thats about five times as long as the absorption rate for all of the new homes constructed around the county
7116677 the years supply combined with developers inability to find construction financing for projects in downtown san diego means the boom time gleam of a new condo project has lost its luster even the regions real estate optimists acknowledge the city core is a hard place to do business right now
7116678 if anything im sort of a downtown booster said local real estate analyst gary london
7116679 a round table gathering of seven business and economic leaders from los angeles county and the region gathered wednesday in pasadena to address concerns about the economy energy prices and the recent closure of 33 indymac banks throughout california
7116680 john bovenzi ceo of indymac federal bank participated in the forum and answered many of the concerns expressed by constituents brenda cox was one of about a dozen people in the audience who sought advice from bovenzi after she lost more than 100 000 after her accounts in indymac were seized by federal regulators
7116681 what would you do in my situation she asked bovenzi
7116682 the canyon lake chamber of commerce held its regular monthly meeting wednesday the keynote speaker was riverside county tax assessor larry ward who said his office has reviewed property values in the county and is offering a reprieve for local homeowners whose homes have decreased in value below their original property tax base
7116683 citywide he said it reflects a 2 82 percentage decrease and countywide the property value assessment rolls were reduced by six billion dollars
7116684 as many local real estate appraisers have already discovered the assessor said canyon lake is a challenge when it comes to determining values because his office does mass appraisals they are faced with the challenges of the area having homes in the million dollar range as well as homes in the 300 000 or even lower price range with factors such as waterfront property and location within the community contributing to the value
7116685 the problem right now is no fair market sales he said the fair market value he explained is a property offered for sale with a willing seller and buyer who are under no undue stress since so many properties are either foreclosures or short sales he said they dont fall into the category of fair market sales
7116686 on thursday about 800 people were registered to attend an auction at the san bernardino county fair grounds to bid on the 163 foreclosed homes that were on the market rob friedman conducted the auction and said the banks are very motivated to get rid of the properties and are taking some big losses
7116687 we are liquidating foreclosures for numerous banks a lot of major national banks have decided they need these properties off their books friedman said
7116688 one example is a large home that was valued at over 300 000 and the winning bid was 70 000
7116689 locally at least 41 percent of homes or 1 600 to 1 700 homes currently listed for sale are foreclosures said carol yule president of the victor valley board of realtors yule said most of the foreclosures didnt happen overnight and in many cases it is a combination of factors that lead to a family losing their home with the biggest issue being equity
7116690 people got this gift of equity we went up 130 percent in home values between 2000 and 2005 so people got this imaginary gift and people borrowed it all said yule
7116691 the investigation began in october 2006 after a woman tried to buy a home in victorville she was denied credit because she was told she already owned a victorville home after checking the report she discovered it showed her having two mortgage loans in her name totaling some 177 000 for which she never applied officials from the san bernardino county district attorneys office said
7116692 two major builders have abandoned housing projects near northeast bakersfields city in the hills development a third is halting construction at an arvin site it recently said was going forward
7116693 such moves appear to be snowballing as deflation of the regions housing bubble continues developers have lost entire tracts to foreclosure sold holdings at fire sale prices and more recently pulled out of sinking projects and markets altogether
7116694 two incomplete model homes baked in the sun thursday on the south side of paladino drive west of vineland road no markings indicated this was the castellina tract of dallas based centex which announced the new neighborhoods opening in october
7116695 unfinished tract walls utility hookups and tiers of graded lots stretched into the distance south and west of the unpainted model units
7116696 lupe chavez the on site sales agent for azul and brisa said a blowout sale held over the weekend was in preparation for shutting down the office by the end of september about 128 of the tracts planned 325 homes have been built
7116697 ill be out of a job chavez said with apparent good humor adding she was ready for a short break after 12 years of selling houses
7116698 cedar funding inc bankruptcy trustee todd neilson cant be accused of sugarcoating his assessment of the monterey real estate lender thursday
7116699 in front of a monterey conference center crowd of about 600 people many of whom sank money into ceder fundings 183 million loan portfolio expecting double digit returns neilson described the companys finances as a mess and a disaster
7116700 about 1 400 people many of them central coast residents sank millions of dollars into individual property loans and a mortgage investment pool managed by cedar funding but trouble started this spring when the state real estate market slumped and cedar funding reduced and then eliminated monthly investor payments
7116701 during a 90 minute presentation neilson detailed three of cedar fundings heaviest real estate investments a golf course and rv park in los angeles county a 78 000 square foot residence in carmel valley and a house in pebble beach that face potentially staggering losses
7116702 cedar funding owner david nilsen sat in the front row of the large meeting room nilsen declined the trustees invitation to answer questions under oath barbara briley a salinas investor approached nilsen during a break and told him he should be in jail with the door closed i am very angry and disappointed she said
7116703 paul capos a carmel valley investor said the trustees report was depressing he said he expects to get back 20 percent to 30 percent of the money he put in the company
7116704 paul forgette an investor from prunedale said its just a dose of reality he said he is fortunate that he doesnt have to rely on cedar funding interest payments to get by what can you do i could get ulcers but this isnt my whole life he said
7116705 cupertino accountant richard smith wants to buy a few bank repossessed houses in antioch and brentwood priced at about 200 000 and rent them out he can make down payments of about 30 percent and can afford the mortgage payments but he cant find a bank who will make him the loans
7116706 im a very active investor im self employed with a solid income and every one of my properties have positive cash flow said smith who has been buying rentals in california and texas for 30 years
7116707 if we cant participate we cant burn through these inventories and help the market correct said geraldine barry president of the san jose real estate investment association
7116708 barry and her husband recently bought a foreclosed house in sacramento for 114 000 the previous owner owed about 250 000 on the property when the bank repossessed it even with a 25 percent down payment they were unable to find a loan because they have more than four outstanding mortgages so they paid in cash
7116709 barry said she wants to buy more bank owned california properties in coming months but has yet to figure out exactly how she will finance deals if lender restrictions remain in place
7116710 there are only so many houses i can buy in cash she said
7116711 a slowing economy and falling gas prices could stem the skyrocketing cost of construction materials which are helping squeeze the profit out of home building
7116712 william lyles president of a diversified construction company in fresno said price declines will become more obvious
7116713 home builders also are getting relief in the form of lower labor costs the slump in construction has flooded the marketplace with workers but housing prices have fallen 16 in just the past year in fresno county which puts builders in a tough spot
7116714 going forward developers will see lower land prices but many builders especially those who entered the fresno area at the peak of the real estate boom are sitting on land they paid top dollar for and cant sell
7116715 they have existing houses they are trying to sell and are faced with a choice going forward they can exit the business or try to charge prices people are willing to pay said bernard markstein senior economist at the national association of home builders
7116716 that means lowering prices to do that builders are constructing smaller homes including fewer frills and accepting little or no profit
7116717 a bigger home is not always better according to a survey by coldwell banker which asked consumers what influences their buying decisions
7116718 when economic times get tough homebuyers crave security they are more apt to choose comfortable cozy and warm homes over airy spaces and lofty views said ruth peters a clinical psychologist in clearwater fla lofty views dont keep people together peters said
7116719 todays buyers dont necessarily need granite tops and new stainless steel appliances that people were demanding three years ago said temple schneider a realtor in camarillo its partly because the market is dominated by short sales and foreclosures and most of the homes on the market are not as nice as they were a few years ago she said
7116720 it seems like buyers attitudes are falling into alignment with whats available schneider said
7116721 while just a few years ago some buyers were eager to get as much house as they could afford now they have grown more cautious many buyers are more willing to trade square footage and fancy upgrades for a lower more comfortable mortgage
7116722 sales of existing homes for july 3 169 up 50 from 2007
7116723 barbara briley a salinas investor approached nilsen during a break and told him he should be in jail with the door closed i am very angry and disappointed she said
7116724 even with a 25 percent down payment they were unable to find a loan because they have more than four outstanding mortgages so they paid in cash
7116725 the fair market value he explained is a property offered for sale with a willing seller and buyer who are under no undue stress since so many properties are either foreclosures or short sales he said they dont fall into the category of fair market sales
7116726 barbara briley a salinas investor approached nilsen during a break and told him he should be in jail with the door closed i am very angry and disappointed she said

7116729 one example is a large home that was valued at over 300 000 and the winning bid was 70 000

7116733 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7116734 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7116735 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7116736 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7116737 even william hartnell who played the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40

7116750 as long as it was great and fantastic then yeah but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it
7116751 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7116752 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7116753 shut up just shut up it is easy to find out whats going on with the show we virtually publish the scripts and we film in public
7116754 but in giving things away you become that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7116755 the show is really tough for a superfit david tennant so you might kill somebody who takes on the role in their 60s for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7116756 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7116757 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7116758 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7116759 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7116760 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7116761 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7116762 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7116763 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7116764 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7116765 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7116766 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7116767 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7116768 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7116769 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write

7116911 to work with an intention of acquiiring more glory in heaven is good but the more perfect is the desire to give glory to god let us be sure that the more we divest ourselves of earthly interests so much the more our savior will increase our joy in paradise
7116912 nikki i could not of got through the summer without your perky self i was so low in the dumps that you just always brought me back lowery and many of us teacher who have been in this school since you came her when it opened i was the first eighth grade class we can never forget you we well i for one have never forgotten you
7116913 i was in an outdoor stadium more like a performance hall or coliseum
7116914 there was this one section that stood out brilliantly to me in the dream and i knew i was supposed to be seated there
7116915 at this point i was down front close to the stage but i knew i must be repositioned for this important meeting instead of just taking the easy way climbing over others by zigzagging and running to secure my seats i went all the way back to the entryway and went through the gate and turnstile again i waited on the three people in front of me as i was waiting on this pathway or concourse that you walk on i stepped out to the aisle and there were children on the ground playing with toys they obviously had some clear plastic toys that were now totally broken into many parts and pieces they were all over the pathway these pieces looked like clear broken glass i thought ive got to go to my seats so i will just step on all the broken parts and keep going i felt the plastic pieces getting into my feet i stopped and grabbed the next post in wonderment shaking my head wondering why all this broken stuff was on this pathway or aisle i was just sitting there plucking it out of my feet and i woke up
7116916 i have destined a place for you in the midst of my positioning you are halfway you are between redemption and purity i am purifying you now so that you can find the redemptive thread for your life and the entryway into your promise your seat and position of authority has been destined
7116917 i am blowing new vision on you to show you your place of authority for this next season do not enter in the gate through an invalid way or hurry past the protocol that has been developed for your safety watch the authorities that i have positioned to help you into this next seat of authority
7116918 when you see your position find your way fully through and into your next place even though much immaturity has torn up and broken the gifts that i am releasing and cluttered the path to where my people will be seated to rule in days ahead walk forward anyway
7116919 walk on top of that immaturity and do not allow that which my children have used wrongly to stop you
7116920 i will redeem your place in the midst of those who have broken rank and run ahead of my perfect timing this will not prevent me from gathering again those who are willing to hear my call i am preparing the places of broken abused and unfulfilled destinies and will reseat my faithful ones that will lead on into the future harvest awaits and i will not be stopped
7116921 for if you remain righteous in your acts and character the lord who knows your way will direct you in a straight path the wicked will perish so do not join yourself with those who are doing wrong for ungodly gain stay true to our lord in this season and you will prosper

7116924 id been doing investment banking full steam ahead and i just decided after doing it for eight years that it was just not my cup of tea
7116925 i had always kept in the back of my mind to be a novelist that just stems from growing up reading a tremendous amount of books frederick forsyth john grisham tom clancy james clavell
7116926 when this whole thing started back in 1994 when i decided i was finished with the whole finance thing i went to my wife and said i wanted to be a novelist
7116927 i wanted hot weather inexpensive living and at least 2 000 miles from my parents
7116928 i was really going to make my best effort to make this thing go
7116929 i thought representation meant wed be selling that book soon
7116930 in january in 1997 we still hadnt sold that book
7116931 theres only one way to be a successful steady writer you go to work every single day i apply the discipline i learned as an investment banker i get to my desk at 6 a m and work until 5 p m
7116932 you cant wait for inspiration to come to you because inspiration comes after four hours of slogging through stuff
7116933 i always know where im going to start and the eventual setup i can envision where it has to end and the crazy part is getting from point a to point b
7116934 what surprises me is how the characters come into a life of their own and they really do demand that you follow their instincts if youre true to your character thats what makes writing so fun youre kind of living inside this story
7116935 once you get into their world it really comes alive these people are really alive for me and they kind of tell me where it has to go

7116942 the theory you hear is that its not a big deal if rod stewart does an album of standards because people will hear the songs but theyre going to hear the songs badly the worst parts of the music
7116943 i have no problem with them making the records but its not representative of the style of music
7116944 when linda ronstadt wanted to make a jazz record she got with nelson riddle and tried to do it right
7116945 i had two older sisters so that music was in the house
7116946 then id go out and hear my dad play with zoot sims with jazz standards
7116947 it was fun to hear all the different kinds of music
7116948 i think he liked the fact that we were at home playing music i think the volume might have got on his nerves
7116949 he still laughs about it because we played outside one summer and the cops came
7116950 i was doing a lot of work with my father and playing guitar and i was playing in restaurants and singing and i was working with a singer who sang a lot of michael franks and kenny rankin kind of stuff
7116951 im out there trying to play a living and im playing a lot more jazz than i am pop tunes
7116952 all those songs related to me it was just as fun to play that stuff as it was to play the rock n roll and pop songs
7116953 i dont think the great american songbook in quotes is a finite thing for a certain era a lot of these songs were showtunes every show had 15 20 songs theres a lot of material from just one show
7116954 billy joel james taylor theres maybe not a lot i can turn into my style swing jazz style certainly theres material being written thats in reach
7116955 in general good songs stay with you no matter what theyre don henley songs i think are great therere a lot of great sting songs therere billy joel songs
7116956 the thing thats sort of fun is that everybody can do the same songs and the individual brings their own personality so you can hear five recordings of all of me or any gershwin and youll hear five versions
7116957 ive been wanting to write about this place where i live for the longest time
7116958 i just had so much fun writing about it because the landscape is so wonderful and people dont write about it much
7116959 i really wanted to have the place be a character
7116960 for this particular story i got the idea when i read this small news article about a fake psychic in florida who had been busted finally for ripping off infirm elderly floridians for years
7116961 i understood her victims theres a willingness there to go into it but what i was really intrigued by was the psychic herself and how far into your own grift do you have to believe how did she arrange it in her mind that was the beginning of the story for me
7116962 what better place to set it than here people have psychics here they way they have dog walkers its a very psychic friendly place
7116963 i didnt go to any because i sort of knew what they were going to say because they have a general path they follow
7116964 i dont want to parody or incorporate any psychics i saw into the book i wanted my character to be my character that i created without input from anyone
7116965 general retail and scroll down this is a visa site with all visa discounts there will will see sears click there for 25 off 250 when you use visa but you must shop through the visa link and you must use visa it will come off automaticly
7116966 we were halfway through a national tour and i got a call from our management that columbia was dropping the band and was not going to put out the record which had been mixed and mastered
7116967 that was a definitely abrupt stop to the whole label side of things
7116968 wed done recordings in the past and demos and passed our music around on our own this is the first actual album thats being released
7116969 it costs so much money to be on the road its a tough thing youre paying over 4 a gallon for gas and youre in a van that gets 10 miles to the gallon and were a band that doesnt draw thousands of kids to a show
7116970 we do west coast stuff keeping it more local for the time being
7116971 we definitely love to just go out and play because we love to play shows we rehearse a lot its nice to get out of the rehearsal studio and into a venue
7116972 i feel were saying more than just the sonic sound of the music we have a message in an industry filled with a lot of negative music we create something positive
7116973 physical unbuttoning of their jeans captures the provoking theme of self expression and unrestrained behavior
7116974 while you would think levis would promote their brand with images of people desiring to wear not remove their jeans they have instead turned to the very type of sexualized marketing we have been fighting for years
7116975 in other words levis is encouraging our teens and young adults to engage in random premarital sexual encounters which we know has serious negative consequences
7116976 their marketing campaign encourages a moral philosophy of sexuality that not only is unfulfilling but also extremely harmful to americas youth

7116978 im cautiously optimistic that the voters will re elect me
7116979 but itll take work my opponent is a serious candidate and he works hard
7116980 ive been reaching out to constituents for the past two years as their senator
7116981 the people of this district tell me theyre concerned about two main things economic opportunity and fiscal responsibility two sides of the same coin
7116982 ill be interested in seeing the actual numbers when theyre available
7116983 but theres no question cook county businesses are hurting because of the increase
7116984 can we actually do these things who would have ever guessed a democratic led house and senate would have been able to pass the med mal legislation a few years ago
7116985 the people of illinois demanded change and when they worked to hold elected people accountable and they were successful something like that should encourage more people to get involved not just watch whats going on
7116986 we need to think about this states future in three or five years we dont and keep doing what the democrats are doing illinois will get so bad it will make michigan look like an economic wonderland
7116987 dont forget that cook county sales tax passed by one vote one vote
7116988 i think we could see an interesting challenge for the board presidency in 2010 with the right matchup
7116989 people dont believe they have as much effect as they do but why do you think the pay raise was stopped last week
7116990 we were going to have a pay raise until the democrats thought it could cost them votes
7116991 jones resigned this week before august 28 when the process to fill open seat slots gets more complicated
7116992 we need to pass legislation to prevent things like that from happening again
7116993 we have sponsored legislation requiring committee assignment for any bill with 50 or more senators signed on as co sponsors
7116994 until that happens were going to continue introducing legislation that would change the states direction if we could just get a fair hearing
7116995 thats probably the hardest decision ive had to make as a state senator
7116996 theres a lot that could be done with the rules without touching the constitution i know people like bruno behrend disagree with this but im concerned about the potential there would be for worse things to come from opening the constitution i just dont trust the powers that be right now
7116997 the biggest pleasant surprise is that the vast majority in the senate are good and decent people
7116998 my biggest unpleasant surprise is just how petty and personal the democrats fights have become
7116999 but i couldnt tell you who theyll finally come up with
7117000 i even went over to the other side of the aisle to see if anyone would vote for me
7117001 the united republican fund appreciates matts solid conservative values and his optimistic leadership over the past two years as a freshman legislator
7117002 matts the kind of lawmaker well need to gain republican victories in the years to come our efforts are to increase the number of republican conservatives in the general assembly and holding onto the 27 th senate seat is an important part of this years efforts
7117003 the people of the northwest suburbs gave to illinois a gem when they sent matt murphy to the senate last election
7117004 we look forward to keeping matt in his senate seat and him continuing to lead the way for conservatives statewide

7117008 the vietnamese soldiers seem to have been given a mission to shoot to kill anyone they want in the central highlands just as it was when vietnam was at war with america many years ago
7117009 the indigenous degar people are a distinct ethic group with different ancestry and a completely different culture and language from the vietnamese this is why vietnam finds it so easy to annihilate our people
7117010 who profess to be moral and civilized not only sit idly by ignoring the evil and inhuman actions of the vietnamese government but actually aid them with financial support because of their business investments in vietnam
7117011 our ministry is housing about twice as many people as we did just four years ago but many of the individuals we see on the streets never come to joy junction or i suspect to the other homeless agencies in town i know some of those panhandling are hungry ive bought meals for some of them but i suspect some are less than honest i saw a truck with out of state tags drop off a panhandler the other day and pick up someone from the same spot they appeared to be trading places
7117012 if you see a person who is asking for money for food you can take him or her to the nearest restaurant and buy a meal you may even want to buy some coupons for a fast food restaurant if you have time and feel so inclined consider talking to the person learn their story however i advise against giving money as you could be contributing to life controlling issues that the panhandler may be experiencing
7117013 in years past weve had tragedy from people doing this its impossible to adequately screen everyone you see on the street asking for money or a job so our advice is to never take anyone into your home in fact never give someone you dont know your home address or your residential telephone number
7117014 just like our guests at joy junction i suspect some of those panhandling have been through unspeakable emotional and physical devastation in their lives and as a result they are unable to find regular employment until those issues are addressed
7117015 it is very exciting to see lives being put back together with the ultimate aim of people getting back on their feet again and becoming contributing members of the community
7117016 and just like the title of my upcoming book says we all need a little help

7117025 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein

7117055 i think sen obama wants to make the american people confident that he will have around him people that will make sure he knows and has access to all the information he needs hes trying to say this is symbolic of the kind of people who are going to govern with me its probably the most important message for him and ive felt that way for a long time
7117056 ive disagreed with him but biden is somebody ive always been able to sit down with and discuss the issues hes a very good colleague in that regard i dont remember having a bad word with him
7117057 you hear things but nobody has really said anything solid we dont really know whats going on
7117058 thats still the plan the redevelopment of that space is still in the works but this has been an absolutely horrible year for retailers around the country weve seen just an incredible reticence on the part of retailers all over the place
7117059 we continued to look for good tenants as we look to remerchandising the american mall but its been a slower a much slower than average process
7117060 weve had zero days completely dead days we have certain customers that maybe come in once a week or so but yes we have zero days
7117061 its just amazing how quiet it is i dont know how they keep it open
7117062 maybe when everything else opens i guess people might come over just to look around but if they dont do something i think people are just going to give up
7117063 i think our exhibitors in a few of the larger animal exhibits are down slightly its not as big as i feared
7117064 were probably down between five and 10 percent on the large animal exhibits in some cases its kids only taking one project instead of two we havent lost 10 percent of our families but we have lost a few families weve had a few switch to rabbits and poultry projects instead of larger animals
7117065 i think it has to be whats going on as much as anything its the feed cost and the economy
7117066 even if the feed costs didnt increase theres less discretionary income for a project i think its had a slight affect
7117067 i think people are doing everything they can to keep their kids involved i dont think were going to see any major decline
7117068 i think its going to be more of a shift and maybe a slight pulling back maybe the child will bring one steer and a pen of hogs instead of two steers and a pen of hogs maybe theyll bring one hog instead of two hogs hopefully were going to keep kids engaged and involved but they may need to cut back just because of the costs
7117069 weve heard some stuff from people with economic concerns they kind of complain about the high costs
7117070 these kids in the beef barn will start all over again right after they sell this one its a full year project despite whats going on

7117108 it will just reduce the money in circulation in iraqi markets

7117119 abc news brian wheeler reports on the day of the democrats first rumble in south carolina and a critical vote demanding the president begin withdrawing troops from iraq sen joe biden d del said thursday
7117120 the surge is not succeeding and the president refuses to see that
7117121 i want to make it clear that i totally oppose the surging of additional american troops into baghdad i think it is contrary to the overwhelming body of informed opinion a surge of up to 30 000 american troops cannot have any positive effect except for only temporary we have to make it clear to the iraqis that in this quarter were going to begin to draw down american troops the overwhelming reason for that is we must force a political settlement they must understand that there is no prospect for us to be able to bring peace to iraq if the iraqis dont want peace as much as we do
7117122 biden proposes that the iraqis set up three semi autonomous regions one each to be overseen by the suunis shiites and kurds with a central government having limited federal powers

7117125 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7117126 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7117127 a territory appurtenant and belonging to the united states but not a part of the united states
7117128 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7117129 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7117130 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7117131 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7117132 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7117133 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7117134 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7117135 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7117136 we want the challenge of the encounter to be the fight itself not collecting all of the buffs and debuffs you need to succeed
7117137 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7117138 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7117139 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7117140 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7117141 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7117142 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7117143 il y a des matches o tu peux parler de football

7117146 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7117147 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7117148 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7117149 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7117150 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7117151 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7117152 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7117153 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7117154 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7117155 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7117156 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7117157 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7117158 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7117159 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7117160 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7117161 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7117162 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7117163 give child molesters something more interesting to do with their time
7117164 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world
7117165 hey check out that lovely young lady shes exactly the kind of woman i want to marry and take home to my mother
7117166 theres nothin wrong with a little jenna jameson after a hard days work
7117167 getting married to have sex is like buying a 747 to get free peanuts
7117168 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7117169 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7117170 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7117171 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7117172 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7117173 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7117174 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7117175 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7117176 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7117177 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7117178 who are open to doing something on the production side
7117179 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7117180 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7117181 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7117182 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7117183 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7117184 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7117185 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7117186 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7117187 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7117188 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7117189 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7117190 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7117191 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7117192 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7117193 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7117194 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7117195 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7117196 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7117197 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7117198 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7117199 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7117200 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7117201 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7117202 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7117203 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7117204 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7117205 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7117206 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7117207 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7117208 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7117209 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7117210 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7117211 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7117212 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7117213 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7117241 im pleased that speaker pelosi has indicated her support for additional disaster relief funding and i will continue working to ensure that iowa has the resources necessary to rebuild
7117242 many of our communities have been affected by the recent floods and thousands of iowans are struggling to get back on their feet
7117243 i have explained to house speaker nancy pelosi that iowans need our help and she personally assured me that when congress reconvenes in september we will take up and pass a second disaster assistance package
7117244 i am pleased to announce today that speaker pelosi has accepted my invitation to tour flood damaged areas of iowa the gravity of our situation here in iowa must not go unaddressed i am committed to seeing our state clean up move forward and thrive once again and i will not rest until further funding is provided for the ongoing recovery effort

7117258 while any human being especially a candidate for president who is constantly being poked and prodded can be forgiven a momentary flash of temper bidens detractors point to that incident as evidence that the senator thinks he is the bees knees and doesnt care who knows it
7117259 a fragment from the blank shot hit my left eye but i didnt know and continued to work director mikeal hafstrom and all members in the film crew were concerned and asked me to see the doctor but i didnt go because i thought it would affect the schedule
7117260 i am really happy because after each scene i was given emotional encouragement especially from director mikael hafstrom it gave me extra motivation even though they were all strangers
7117261 the talent of hollywood film makers is that they create such a real background everything seemed real so the feeling of being scared and terrible was also real the scenes of war shooting and death made me feel as if i was there
7117262 i was surprised when i looked at the film shots that i look so mature and become another person under the hand of the talented director
7117263 it was a big film crew but the schedule was very specific
7117264 every detail was coordinated the stuntmen acted first so that the main characters could understand the action they held frank discussions with the director to find the best way to perform its really intellectual cooperation
7117265 for me in 13 days in spite of my small role i learnt a number of lessons especially more confidence in myself future openings for me and for vietnam movies it proved that vietnam movie stars are capable but havent had many chances to develop their talent
7117266 american filmmakers are surveying the asian market this was the first time they came to vietnam at the end of this year when shanghai is released the filmmakers will see the publics reaction i hope that we now have two vietnamese actresses and next year 10 12 more so that more vietnamese actors actresses will be able to appear in hollywood films and vietnamese motion pictures will cooperate with hollywood

7117300 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7117301 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan

7117303 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7117304 obama after all isnt having trouble with african american voters or hispanic voters or young voters where hes lagging is among white voters and with older ones in particular call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
7117305 what makes obamas task of scoring white votes at kerry gore levels so formidable is to put it bluntly racial prejudice
7117306 whats clear however is that among older less educated white voters there is a pronounced albeit inchoate unease with obamas otherness
7117307 but they also strike me as insufficient responses to the race fueled angst that obamas candidacy has stirred up and that the mccain campaign plans artfully viciously to exacerbate in the weeks ahead
7117308 the reigning cliche of this election year that we are in uncharted waters here without either map or compass has never been more apt than when it comes to the question of race
7117309 would it really seem strange from that vantage point if the first black major party nominee a guy with a thin resume no foreign policy credentials in an era scarred by terrorism a background alien to much of wonder bread america and the full name barak hussein obama lost

7117322 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7117323 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7117324 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7117325 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7117326 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7117327 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7117328 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7117329 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7117330 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7117331 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7117332 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7117333 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7117334 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7117335 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7117336 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history

7117339 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7117340 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7117341 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7117342 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7117343 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7117344 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7117345 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7117346 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7117347 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years

7117362 these grade level performance standards describe behaviors typical at the specified grade level they represent behaviors students generally exhibit as they move from novice to expert in their ability to take control of language processes it is important to remember however that literacy learning may not be sequential and each child has a unique developmental pattern
7117363 an equally important understanding is that a students development is unique and influenced by many factors and therefore the accomplishment of these performance standards may occur in grade levels other than those at which they are designated
7117364 finally although there are four language arts standards it is important to keep in mind their connectedness

7117373 it kind of takes senator obama off his message of change because joe biden isnt much change he even makes john mccain look young
7117374 we do expect there are going be some people who are not happy about the decision who are not happy hilary wasnt even interviewed for it but i think we will all end up in the same boat at the end of the convention

7117413 nuestros corazones y nuestras oraciones est n con el padre del beb rafael sanz y con todos los seres queridos de donnette

7117416 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7117417 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7117418 in his very first appearance as the vice presidential candidate biden demonstrated that hes more than willing to play the traditional role of attack dog
7117419 he recited a litany of what many democrats feel is wrong with the current administration and linked his friend john mccain to them in doing so biden proved himself an able fighter in his initial outing
7117420 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7117421 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7117422 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7117423 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7117424 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7117425 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7117426 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7117427 he was indias best bet in pakistan we will miss musharraf
7117428 if he had not fired his judges and gotten bogged down in domestic dramas i believe we would have been able to make a significant breakthrough in a peace deal in kashmir today
7117429 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
7117430 still musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times
7117431 no new applications for fan publishers are being accepted and we expect the broad variety of options provided through adsense including the new adsense for feeds product powered with feedburner feeds will give publishers valuable new revenue earning potential
7117432 couldnt claim any major legislative victories during his tenure as chairman concerning indian country
7117433 he put forward a piece of legislation that would have added more burdensome regulation to our gaming industry at a time when our federal funding was at its lowest point
7117434 we were very disappointed because weve had a long history with sen mccain and i know that if he personally had gotten the message he might have met with us but we couldnt get to him
7117435 sen obamas going to have to meet with tribes on a daily basis to catch up with the 25 years sen mccain has spent on their issues
7117436 i dont think theres anything that even looks like a horse race in terms of intimacy of association and familiarity with the issues
7117437 sen mccain knows us intimately so he knows our strengths as well as our weaknesses so that could play good and bad for us
7117438 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7117439 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7117440 reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals
7117441 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7117442 why dont you call obama to help you haha lets see obama get you out of this one hahaha
7117443 if there is any writing on the ballot other than the line to connect the arrows then the ballot will be rejected and not counted
7117444 why dont you call obama to help you haha lets see obama get you out of this one hahaha
7117445 when i first saw a briefing on the predator three years ago i saw one of my mission sets disappear i miss the thrill of flying but hanging around for hours in a plane is a waste of manpower
7117446 we have just won a war with a lot of heroes flying around in planes the next war may be fought by airplanes with no men in them at all
7117447 it is possible to build a transoceanic missile right now
7117448 but we dont know whether it will land in spain portugal or france
7117449 uavs success is not due to a single breakthrough but a combination of innovations in several areas
7117450 you may not have the fear of death but all the other fears are still there the fear of the unknown and the fear of failure
7117451 paradoxically as a result of our success the target has become even more decentralized even more diffused and presents a more difficult target no question about that
7117452 its clear that the u s is prepared to use and deploy these weapons in a fairly wide theater
7117453 we have the plans in place to do them globally
7117454 in most cases we need the approval of the host country to do them however there are a few countries where the president has decided that we can whack someone without the approval or knowledge of the host government
7117455 an alarming precedent and a clear case of extrajudicial killing
7117456 zawahiri is an easy case no one is going to question us going after him
7117457 but where can you do it and who can you do it against who authorizes it all of these are totally unregulated areas of presidential authority
7117458 paris its easy to say we wont do it there
7117459 i dont think anyone is dealing with solid footing here there is legal as well as operational doctrine that is being developed as we go along
7117460 you give shelter to al qaeda figures you may well get your village blown up
7117461 conversely you have to note that this can also create local animosity and instability
7117462 i think the attack was a major screw up because so many kids died it raises questions about the entire process
7117463 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
7117464 the garda s och na will succeed not by force of arms or numbers but on their moral authority as servants of the people
7117465 the taboo on killing unarmed men and women who could not reasonably be seen as spies and informers
7117466 is it just wishful thinking that thered be one on september 4th at the lincoln theater for arenas second show of the season

7117530 about 16 years ago i started vaccinating without even thinking about it and after her fourth set of shots i began to notice marked changes in her behavior

7117548 a man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a new suit to do it in
7117549 old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served his valet if a hero ever has a valet bare feet are older than shoes and he can make them do
7117550 i say beware of all enterprises that require new clothes and not rather a new wearer of clothes if there is not a new man how can the new clothes be made to fit if you have any enterprise before you try it in your old clothes all men want not something to do with but something to do or rather something to be perhaps we should never procure a new suit however ragged or dirty the old until we have so conducted so enterprised or sailed in some way that we feel like new men in the old and that to retain it would be like keeping new wine in old bottles our moulting season like that of the fowls must be a crisis in our lives the loon retires to solitary ponds to spend it thus also the snake casts its slough and the caterpillar its wormy coat by an internal industry and expansion for clothes are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil otherwise we shall be found sailing under false colors and be inevitably cashiered at last by our own opinion as well as that of mankind
7117551 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
7117552 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the il bill it included language protecting roe v wade
7117553 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v
7117554 if an abortion is performed or a natural birth occurred at any age even three months and the product of that was living outside the mother and somebody came and shot him i dont think theres any doubt that person would be prosecuted for murder
7117555 whoa what who are you how did you get into my living room mom theres a stranger in the house
7117556 la caravana ser para reafirmar la lucha en un momento en que han aparecido voces que representan los intereses de botnia vamos a recorrer la ruta 136 para terminar en la asamblea de los d as domingos
7117557 no lo veo sinceramente como un inconveniente hoy para nosotros para nada todo lo contrario
7117558 i have seen two of my friends killed i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
7117559 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7117560 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7117561 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7117562 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7117563 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7117564 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7117565 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7117566 wed been flying on a plane for something like 15 hours straight
7117567 we landed in marrakech and it was 110 degrees in the airport no ac and just a sea of people were like its going to take us two hours to get through customs and were just overwhelmed
7117568 and the next thing we see is this tall striking figure in an absolutely clean white shirt striding through the crowd parting everyone and he kind of waves at us and says hey come with me and he just pulls us out of the line and walks us right past customs
7117569 because whenever it is that someone has a problem they call jimmy
7117570 my father was not able to give me once a week money to go to the cinema so i used to sneak into the movies
7117571 its a little closer to moroccan stories of family we dont know the language but we can imagine the conversation
7117572 in the 70s everybody is trying to be like americans
7117573 people would come and say to my mom does mr
7117574 the casting director was having trouble finding smart looking extras
7117575 so i brought him a lot of moroccans my colleagues and then also a lot of europeans being married to an american we used to go to a lot of the mixed marriage or european parties so we used to know a lot of people
7117576 people are looking for a lot of places that double as the middle east and morocco is one of the friendliest for film production
7117577 people there start to acquire knowledge of the filmmaking process so the guy that was originally only the coach to the crew suddenly knows how to do some rigging and before you know it he comes back on the next film and hes a gaffer
7117578 i was doing once a commercial for whiskey and we were trying to re create tibet
7117579 we had to bring all the work stuff to the top of a high atlas and the director came to me with a big smile and said can we get camels here so i went and got him three camels
7117580 but if they want a camel ill get them a camel and they shot it
7117581 there are a lot of places that have companies that are called production service companies and they basically make the arrangements for you they will do the scouting and get the permits
7117582 with certain countries you need political connections to get things done and in those types of countries egypt would be one its important to have someone whos connected to a high level usually high level government to obtain these permits
7117583 usually you need a special fixer when you need some government support when you want to shoot on an air base or with tanks or close some big streets in the middle of a city where normally they wouldnt close the traffic
7117584 a lot of jimmys job was specifically i need to shoot in something that looks like an interrogation room you got any
7117585 and jimmy would go ah i know just the place he took me to a real interrogation room in a police station
7117586 we looked all over morocco we looked in tangier we looked in casablanca
7117587 usually a casbah has very high walls and they built it the same way as the buildings in yemen
7117588 the movies set in the middle east where theres a lot of cultural religious elements that you want to get right
7117589 he acts like more than just the production manager to try and get the authenticity and the type of people and even sometimes the dialect of what people might say jimmy was a resource
7117590 it was like 3 in the morning or something and everyone was exhausted
7117591 the actors were ready to crawl in the car and go home and jimmy comes in and he says you cant go he took me down to this area behind the set where they had been roasting lamb over a pit fire for something like 15 hours straight and we had this giant feast at the end of the night like a send off party
7117592 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7117593 i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect
7117594 in the aftermath i had to remake my health my reputation and my career in the senate
7117595 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7117596 we could have the lord almighty be nominated and someone in this country will communicate to the committee something negative about that person
7117597 if we do nothing theres a serb victory and the continuation of genocide
7117598 if we do what you want we only have two options
7117599 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent

7117626 aidan told me before the king george that you have to really go for him and i was probably a little bit easy on him but he really picked up and when he sensed the other horse coming to him he had plenty left in the tank
7117627 ive said before that he is very durable very consistent and he tries for you
7117628 you can see the size of him and he has a great will to win hes just a great horse
7117629 soft ground fast ground it doesnt matter hes able to take it he eats up every day and he loves racing riding horses like this
7117630 all the team have been amazing to keep him on the go and keep him happening
7117631 hes beaten but definitely not battered he ran a good race and is obviously on the way back
7117632 well regroup and im sure youll see a different horse in two weeks time im not using the good to firm ground as an excuse
7117633 its four group ones he has nearly won now and the other horse just got the measure of him up the hill
7117634 i grew up watching lisa leslie said augustus who finished the tournament with an average of 7

7117637 as ive become the oldest player i just tried to do the exact same thing in giving that information back to sylvia fowles and candace parker and cappie pondexter things like leading by example working hard staying positive even when things arent going great
7117638 its been an honor for me to represent my country ive been so fortunate to have great teammates and i wanted to pass that on to the ones who will represent our country in the future
7117639 she said she was proud of me and i am very proud of her fowles said
7117640 she told me how much better i got and how she loves the way i work i just tried to model what she does
7117641 diana taurasi turned to me and said its up to us now said parker who is expected to take up leslies mantle as a star on and off the court
7117642 i cant wait for the next four years but i keep telling leslie she could get five and im very persuasive

7117759 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7117760 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7117765 the church though dispersed through our the whole world even to the ends of the earth has received from the apostles and their disciples this faith she believes in one god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are in them and in one christ jesus the son of god who became incarnate for our salvation and in the holy spirit who proclaimed through the prophets the dispensations of god and the advents and the birth from a virgin and the passion and the resurrection from the dead and the ascension into heaven in the flesh of the beloved christ jesus our lord and his future manifestation from heaven in the glory of the father
7117766 every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess
7117767 and the angels who transgressed and became apostates together with the ungodly and unrighteous and wicked and profane among men into everlasting fire but may in the exercise of his grace confer immortality on the righteous and holy and those who have kept his commandments and have persevered in his love some from the beginning of their christian course and others from the date of their repentance and may surround them with everlasting glory
7117768 as i have already observed the church having received this preaching and this faith although scattered throughout the whole world yet as if occupying but one house carefully preserves it she also believes these points of doctrine just as if she had but one soul and one and the same heart and she proclaims them and teaches them and hands them down with perfect harmony as if she possessed only one mouth for although the languages of the world are dissimilar yet the import of the tradition is one and the same for the churches which have been planted in germany do not believe or hand down anything different nor do those in spain nor those in gaul nor those in the east nor those in egypt nor those in libya nor those which have been established in the central regions of the world but as the sun that creature of god is one and the same throughout the whole world so also the preaching of the truth shineth everywhere and enlightens all men that are willing to come to a knowledge of the truth nor will any one of the rulers in the churches however highly gifted he may be in point of eloquence teach doctrines different from these for no one is greater than the master nor on the other hand will he who is deficient in power of expression inflict injury on the tradition for the faith being ever one and the same neither does one who is able at great length to discourse regarding it make any addition to it nor does one who can say but little diminish it

7117780 i think we were guilty in the last 15 or 20 minutes of perhaps trying too hard to cling on to the lead and maybe change the type of play that had got us into the lead
7117781 but i think thats fairly understandable were playing one of the top teams in the country
7117782 ive seen two aspects of fulham which i think will be very useful for us in a long hard season
7117783 ive seen the fulham that can play with composure and ive also seen the fulham that when backs are against the wall can produce the necessary fighting spirit
7117784 i think fulham started the game stronger than us and was sharper in the first half although i dont think they created many chances if you look at the whole game
7117785 but they had a corner and they took advantage of it in the first half we were not sharp enough not fast enough on the ball
7117786 i think we were too nervous in the last 25 minutes and wanted too much to create on our own instead of keeping calm we were not at our best today in midfield thats for sure
7117787 the number of people who have become more active and visible on the national political front has increased dramatically because people have suddenly sensed that they have to defend themselves as americans defend themselves as arabs and muslims
7117788 in talking to muslims theyre really struggling between two things they dont know whether to view barack obama as a lesser of two evils or a really good candidate that they are excited about theres no doubt they view him as a better candidate than mccain

7118134 the love and affection of the people has not changed from when i was in this city 10 years ago and a lot of other communities could learn a lot from the one here in leicester
7118135 i am delighted we have raised enough money to be able to acquire our own premises for the charity i never thought it would be as successful as it has been
7118136 for leicester to welcome a star of the calibre of amitabh bachchan is a great honour and one that i know will have delighted our british asian communities

7118186 we have had the best camp we have since i got here
7118187 i thought our guys put tremendous effort and enthusiasm into our camp and they were in much better condition coming into camp and are in much better conditioning coming out of camp
7118188 it has been enjoyable to watch this team grow they have really worked and concentrated hard all the way through we tested them mentally and they did a great job
7118189 these are things we are talking about and not getting a solution to
7118190 my view needs a debate and it cannot be a solution that could be accepted by all
7118191 dont create subsidies that make too much demand over your natural resources subsidies on power on fertiliser would only lead to too much utilisation
7118192 if you want people to be able to afford food than one alternative to food subsidy is to give higher wages like the nregs is an avenue to some extent think about it
7118193 we know the oil prices will be on a high and under such circumstance you cannot keep them down rising prices all the time by giving subsidies

7118197 if it was not for the confusion over stamp duty id probably be in that flat now

7118201 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7118202 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7118203 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7118204 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7118205 everyone should be thinking about that excitement and about what that means for our country whichever direction we go in
7118206 but i think were there just to catch the repercussions of the seedier sides of major events
7118207 any public awareness is good because one of the ways we find out about these is through concerned citizens calling law enforcement or the fbi

7118216 the long and distinguished history of the green globe program in the global travel and tourism industry as well as the strong academic and scientific principles that underpin the green globe standards obviously position green globe very well relative to any accreditation process green globe international will continue to support the policies set forth by the unwto and will ensure that all green globe programs including its comprehensive sustainability and carbon neutrality plans meet the requirements set forth by the stsc

7118261 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7118262 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7118263 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7118264 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7118265 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7118266 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area

7118273 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7118274 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7118275 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history

7118481 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7118482 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7118483 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7118484 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7118485 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7118486 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area

7118492 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7118493 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7118494 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make

7118510 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7118511 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after
7118512 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7118513 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for do not make any efforts at reducing theirs
7118514 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries

7118518 antes solamente se dio el secuestro por razones econ micas se secuestraba a personas clave a personas reconocidas a industriales a ganaderos con un cierto xito econ mico ahorita ya se est secuestrando gente de clase media

7118520 introduce you to the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7118521 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7118522 you cant change america when youve supported george bush 95 percent of the time
7118523 you cant change america when you know that the your first four years as president will look exactly like george bushs last eight years
7118524 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7118525 hay vientos de ingobernabilidad al debilitarse el estado de derecho por la creciente delincuencia e inseguridad p blica la autoridad no est cumpliendo cabalmente con su obligaci n inicial cuidar la vida y lo bienes de los mexicanos
7118526 no hemos encontrado y no han encontrado suficiente capacidad para detener la grave espiral de violencia y muerte que nunca antes se hab a tenido en nuestros territorio nacional en tiempos de paz
7118527 pero as como hemos colaborado enfrentando un problema que aqueja a toda la naci n demandamos que no se utilice electoralmente la problem tica de la inseguridad
7118528 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here and say look you gotta get this done
7118529 we wanted the federal government to tell the state to act quickly on it
7118530 sarkozy cest le seul qui a t oblig de passer par lelys e pour devenir premier ministre
7118531 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7118532 just talk to me as a father not what the constitution says what do you feel
7118533 no arrests have been made at this time and investigations are ongoing
7118534 the scene is being preserved pending a full forensic examination by the garda technical bureau
7118535 the services of the state pathologist have also been requested
7118536 la polizia si affaccia su di un mercato abusivo a palermo gli ambulanti abusivi scappano come topi i
7118537 a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7118538 today ive come back to springfield to tell you ive found that leader
7118539 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7118540 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquires but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7118541 consular officials are in contact with local authorities in an attempt to confirm these reports
7118542 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7118543 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7118544 i have nothing my neighbours feed me if they have food to share
7118545 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7118546 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7118547 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7118548 canadians will like the fact that both of them are opposed to the war in iraq
7118549 theyll like the fact that theyre both knowledgeable about world affairs theyll like that obama and biden will take a multinational approach and not an our way or the highway approach to international issues
7118550 the idea that we are not willing to take the prime minister of canada and the president of mexico to the mat to make this agreement work is just a lack of presidential leadership
7118551 certainly obama and biden will take a more aggressive approach to increasing fuel efficiency for automobiles thatll be tough on the auto industry but they can do it and generally they favour a more aggressive approach on environmental regulation
7118552 so right at the top of the ticket you have someone who brings significant expertise in areas that concern canadians
7118553 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7118554 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7118555 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the centre of an international crisis
7118556 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7118557 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7118558 virtually unchallenged usa patriot act a massive knot of draconian laws that in spirit is absolutely indistinguishable in spirit from hitlers enabling act and continuing through the hr 1955 plus stealth legislation that guarantees dictatorial powers to the one man on earth the least competent to wield them it would be farcical to think that we have as many or more constitutional protections than we did prior to 2001
7118559 so instead of enforcing the rule of law well just busy ourselves making up new laws that will also look opportunistic and partisan should we try to enforce them if the minority gop sees it that way
7118560 ergo you peasants ought to be satisfied that were at least giving you the appearance of looking busy vote for me in november
7118561 paul we admire you and all so dont get us wrong youre handsome dynamic youve acquired a national following because you take the right positions that we too would love to take and lord knows you can get the parishioners to kick in to the collection plate until it hurts
7118562 so while we admire you for bringing out the vote and helping turn a red district bluer lets just say that even if you win the democratic primary dont count on our support so go back to shaking sand out of your boxer shorts in baghdad ok sport thanks and have a nice war that we fully intend to continue funding forever
7118563 figure out which of the kitchen tables to sit at
7118564 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7118565 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7118566 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7118567 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7118568 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7118569 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7118570 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7118571 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7118572 why dont i like the way youre looking at me
7118573 probably because youre a smart man and you already know what im going to say
7118574 no way i dont mind providing back up but im not doing a solo number
7118575 you can sit at the keyboard i wont make you take center stage
7118576 no you wont you never do come on ill even have them keep the light real dim if thatll help
7118577 lonely no more and ever the same and thank you
7118578 a rob thomas fan youve got the voice for it alex
7118579 well do the thomas songs first and save gift for last youre the best twin
7118580 and youre a terror tell the lighting guy to keep me in the shadows
7118581 cant have my bro going all nervy on me just pretend were at home rehearsing
7118582 this will wrap it up folks lets send you home with a song my brother wrote
7118583 come on shy one the owner wants to talk to us
7118584 he already knows you dont like to shake hands so relax
7118585 you left the audition before we could meet alison told me youre not used to singing lead i wanted to thank you personally for making the opening week a success and for singing for me
7118586 oh well alison and the band make me sound good
7118587 i listened carefully during your solos and youre good your last song gave me chills
7118588 are you always this self effacing trust me ive spent the last six months auditioning bands and singers and you guys are great im prepared to offer you a contract if youll answer one question
7118589 why is the band named tfb relativity ive been trying to figure it out for two weeks
7118590 my weird twins idea were all trust fund babies and sort of related keith and caitlin are brother and sister keith and i are married and caitlins married to david see
7118591 alex what is it come on come out alex come out
7118592 listen wed like to work here but you have to understand something first
7118593 alex has a gift and im not talking about music he calls it a curse and i cant say i blame him its certainly brought him nothing but grief
7118594 ah thats why youve been favoring your left leg sciatica okay hold on
7118595 not a clue this is my gift and its more or less benign his isnt and thats why he doesnt like to shake hands or be touched at all
7118596 his song but why would he consider it a curse
7118597 i told you his gift is different i tune in on hurts and heal them alex tunes in on thoughts and hears them mine is voluntary and under my control his isnt
7118598 hes a touch telepath and wide open all the time
7118599 you might get his prints which probably wont help you because i dont think he has a record hes too careful for that still i had to call you
7118600 first a promise you have to keep this from alison
7118601 i thought you two dont have secrets that youre in each others heads too much to hide things
7118602 she told you that not me i learned a long time ago to shield part of my mind from her i had to
7118603 the things ive seen no way she should share that no one else should ever see the monsters that inhabit my mind
7118604 so give me your promise alison doesnt hear this from you
7118605 hes focused on me im his next victim and i think he knows im onto him
7118606 believe it or dont but see the guy sitting with him hes a detective with homicide hard nosed as youll ever meet he believes
7118607 hes also clairvoyant he picks up things about people from items theyve handled sometimes the cops bring him things from cases theyre working sometimes like tonight he calls them
7118608 so alex touched that empty drinking glass and picked up something that made him call the cops what is some guy gonna go home and shoot his wife how the hell does that help
7118609 jesus alison every gay man in town is looking twice at people theyve known all their lives because of this bastard big as i am i havent even dated in six months wondering if some new guy might be him your brothers trying to help catch him
7118610 well id be lying he isnt in the closet either hasnt been for years
7118611 i tried to get him to take off with me just cut and run he wouldnt i told him he could at least stay out of this one keep his head down he didnt
7118612 he isnt involved with anyone not in a long time its difficult
7118613 yeah that touch thing after a few dates most guys run too intrusive it isnt like he can help it but they dont see it that way one guy stuck around long enough to shit what the hell am i doing i never talk this much
7118614 im a good listener and right now youre worried anyone can see that
7118615 not my place to say anyway hes done talking and will be here soon
7118616 yeah we have a stronger link than most twins youll get used to it or not
7118617 im going to load up my equipment and head home i need a shower and sleep
7118618 nichts ist widerw rtiger als die majorit t denn sie besteht aus wenigen kr ftigen vorg ngern aus schelmen die sich akkomodieren aus schwachen die sich assimilieren und der masse die nachtrollt ohne nur im mindesten zu wissen was sie will
7118619 wir treten in eine science fiction welt ein in der sich alles mischt das gute das b se das wahre das falsche alles ebnet sich auf niedrigem niveau ein
7118620 um ein vorbildliches mitglied einer schafherde zu sein mu man vor allem ein schaf sein
7118621 auch wenn 50 millionen menschen etwas dummes sagen bleibt es trotzdem eine dummheit
7118622 moralischen hintergrund zur rechtfertigung dieses terrors liefern dazu die monotheistischen glaubenshalluzinationen in unserem kulturkreis vorwiegend die christliche kirche die sich nach der konstantinischen anerkennung radikal von ihren pazifistischen idealen abgewandt hat
7118623 lasset uns menschen machen nach unserem abbild uns hnlich sie sollen herrschen ber des meeres fische ber die v gel des himmels ber das vieh ber alle landtiere und ber alle kriechtiere am boden
7118624 seid fruchtbar mehret euch und f llet die erde furcht vor euch und schrecken sei bei allen erdentieren bei allen himmelsv geln bei allem was auf dem erdboden kriecht und bei allen fischen des meeres in eure hand sind sie gegeben alles was sich regt und lebendig ist diene euch zur nahrung
7118625 tiere haben keine geistige seele und kennen kein fortleben nach dem tode darum haben sie aber auch keine w rde auf die sie rechte bauen k nnten und in der tat tiere haben keine rechte sie haben keinen anspruch auf dasein und gesundheit auf eigentum und guten ruf
7118626 einige tiersch tzer behaupten die tiere h tten analog unseren menschlichen grundrechten auch ein grundrecht auf leben was halten sie davon
7118627 das ist unsinn das ist weder rechtlich noch theologisch noch philosophisch haltbar nur der mensch ist person dem tier fehlt der personencharakter in der hinordnung des tieres auf den nutzen des menschen l t sich nicht nur seine verwendung sondern auch seine t tung rechtfertigen oder seine zucht
7118628 das elend der tiere dieser permanente massenmord der eigentlich auch nur jeden halbwegs sensiblen um den verstand bringen m te resultiert im j disch christlichen raum aus der ebenso albernen wie anma enden bibellehre von der von der gottesebenbildlichkeit des menschen aus jenem arroganten anthropozentrismus also wonach dicht auf gott der mensch kommt und dann erst der rest der welt
7118629 die christliche moral hat ihre vorschriften ganz auf den menschen beschr nkt die gesamte tierwelt rechtlos gelassen man sehe nur wie unser christlicher p bel gegen die tiere verf hrt sie v llig zwecklos und lachend t tet oder verst mmelt oder martert seine pferde im alter bis aufs u erste anstrengt um das letzte mark aus ihren armen knochen zu arbeiten bis sie unter streichen erliegen man m chte wahrlich sagen die menschen sind die teufel der erde und die tiere ihre geplagten seelen
7118630 k nnt ihr wirklich die frage stellen aus welchem grunde sich pythagoras des fleischessens enthielt ich f r meinen teil frage mich unter welchen umst nden und in welchem geisteszustand es ein mensch das erste mal ber sich brachte mit seinem mund blut zu ber hren seine lippen zum fleisch eines kadavers zu f hren und seinen tisch mit toten verwesenden k rpern zu zieren und es sich erlaubt hat die teile die kurz davor noch gebr llt und geschrien sich bewegt und gelebt haben nahrung zu nennen es handelt sich gewi nicht um l wen und w lfe die wir zum selbstschutz essen im gegenteil diesen tieren schenken wir gar keine beachtung vielmehr schlachten wir harmlose zahme gesch pfe ohne stacheln und z hne die uns ohnehin nichts anhaben k nnten um des fleisches willen rauben wir ihnen die sonne das licht und die lebensdauer die ihnen von geburt an zustehen wenn ihr nun behaupten wollt da die natur solche nahrung f r euch vorgesehen h tte dann t tet selbst was ihr zu essen gedenkt jedoch mit euren naturgegebenen mitteln nicht mit hilfe eines schlachtmessers einer keule oder eines beils
7118631 das denkende menschengeschlecht das hei t h chstens der hunderttausendste teil der menschheit
7118632 rationale verhaltensweisen im 21 jhd unter ber cksichtigung eines anst ndigen umgangs mit den tieren
7118633 thank you again so much for making a shy girl feel good about herself and having it come through in these photos i know my husband is going to love them and i cant wait to share them with him on our anniversary please also thank tricia for me as well she is wonderful and you guys make a great team
7118634 oh my am i really that hot i am floored they are amazing i dont think i am going to be able to pick
7118635 ich glaube an gott den vater den allm chtigen sch pfer des himmels und der erden und an jesus christus gottes eingebornen sohn unsern herrn der empfangen ist vom heiligen geist geboren von der jungfrau maria gelitten unter pontius pilatus gekreuziget gestorben und begraben niedergefahren zur h lle am dritten tage auferstanden von den toten aufgefahren gen himmel sitzend zur rechten gottes des allm chtigen vaters von dannen er kommen wird zu richten die lebendigen und die toten ich glaube an den heiligen geist eine heilige christliche kirche die gemeinde der heiligen vergebung der s nden auferstehung des fleisches und ein ewiges leben amen
7118636 luther zum beispiel hat in seiner bersetzung von den kriegsgefangenen davids 1
7118637 aber das volck drinnen f ret er eraus und legt sie unter eisern segen und zacken und eisern keile und verbrand sie in zigel fen
7118638 aber das volk darin f hrte er heraus und stellte sie als fronarbeiter an die s gen die eisernen pickel und an die eisernen xte und lie sie an den ziegel fen arbeiten
7118639 abspaltung auswurf gem nzt auf die die sich von der wahrheit absondern an der man selbst festh lt sektierer h retiker sind immer die anderen stets hat man minderheiten so bezeichnet die sich von der mehrheit trennten darin schwingt mit die wahrheit liegt bei der mehrheit sie hat die macht folglich das recht denen die nicht mitmachen besagten schimpfnamen anzuh ngen
7118640 das wort sekte noch immer zur diskriminierung religi ser minderheiten dient weswegen sachlich zunehmend von religi sen bzw christl sonder gemeinschaften bzw vereinigungen gesprochen wird
7118641 solange keine bereitschaft von linker seite besteht sich die argumente zumindest anzuh ren wird immer weiter eine neue form von hierarchie zementiert
7118642 die heiligenlegenden entlarvte luther als m rchen an den bibellegenden hielt er fest am teufelsglauben auch am hexenwahn auch an der ketzervertilgung auch am antisemitismus auch am kriegsdienst an der leibeigenschaft den f rsten man nennt es reformation
7118643 fest an gottes gnade und das stellvertretende s hneleiden christi glaube
7118644 obrigkeitlich verwalteten landeskirchentum lutherischer provenienz die verbindung von thron und altar enger der allm chtige kirchenstaat h rtere realit t geworden war als in der vorreformatorisichen kirchlich katholischen zeit in der der kampf zwischen kaiser und papst landesf rst und kirchenf rst noch m glich gewesen war
7118645 der herrschende wiederum hat daf r zu sorgen dass im land nur ein einziger glaube praktiziert wird
7118646 die kirche stellt dem totalit ren f rstenstaat die gl ubigen als gehorsame staatsdiener zur verf gung der staat unterst tzt und hilft der kirche und ermordet eventuelle gegner der kirche
7118647 luther in seiner reformatorischen anfangsphase m ntzer die t ufer aber auch das
7118648 einer demokratischen kirche viel n her stehen als sie selbst
7118649 der eigene abfall vom ideal wird verdr ngt und kaschiert daf r wird ein s ndenbock gesucht auf den man alles l dt was man selber vers umt verbockt oder verbrochen hat wie gesagt die heutigen evangelischen kirchenapologeten l gen sich in die eigene tasche wenn sie luthers kritik an der r misch katholischen kirche zu verharmlosen suchen
7118650 der obrigkeitssklave luther gestattet sich doppelmoral den lutherischen herrschern bzw
7118651 luther ist kein tief religi ser reformator auch nicht bloss irgendein sektenj ger sondern geradezu der von tausend teufeln des hasses und der mordlust getriebene klassische typ des ketzer und sektenvernichters ein grossinquisitor neuen stils da er nicht einmal die gerichtsprozesse die die katholische inquisition immerhin wenigstens formell vorschrieb und durchf hrte abwartete sondern ohne gericht ohne untersuchung oder berpr fung die herrscher und das volk zum totschlagen der bauern und ihrer anf hrer der ketzer und sektenangeh rigen der papisten und humanisten demagogisch hypnotisierend aufrief und aufforderte
7118652 wir wollen das geschichtliche erbe der lutherischen tradition bewahren als unsere kulturelle und geistige heimat
7118653 ganz wie die papisten hielt auch der ex m nch luther die frauen als f r hexerei und zauberei besonders anf llig und zwar wegen ihrer allzu grossen liebe zu ihren kindern wegen ihrer angebliche dummheit ihres unverst ndnisses ihrer angst und neugier kein zweifel der hass vornehmlich gegen frauen wie er sich in der hexenverfolgung kundtat wurde von rom aus verbreitet im interesse des papsttums aber als die reformation ausbrach wurde der wahn nicht erkannt und abgelegt sondern er wuchs noch
7118654 wurden von lutheranern sogar noch fanatischer verfolgt als von der alten inquisition
7118655 und dass frauen minderwertig sind stand f r den gr ssten aller reformatoren so fest wie f r die gr ssten kirchenlehrer der catholica
7118656 das nahezu bedenkenswerteste wort aber das ich ber luther kenne stammt von einem sonst nicht sonderlich von mir gesch tzten katholiken von joseph lortz und lautet
7118657 alles leid der menschen der tiere und pflanzen das wirklich zu beseitigen ist weil es von menschen christen kirchen verantwortet wird muss von den menschen selbst angegangen werden unsereins sollte das bessere nicht vom tod und dem angeblichen leben nach diesem erwarten sondern von sich selbst dies war der antike noch bewusst ihre menschen f rchteten den tod weit weniger als die menschen des christlichen abendlandes weil sie lebten w hrend den christen das leben mit seinen sinnen aberzogen wurde da der wandel des christen im himmelreich sein sollte blieb f r die erde wenig brig irdisches leid ist f r viele christen weithin unerheblich sie sehen nicht recht ein weshalb sie sich im jammertal engagieren sollen daran erkennen wir geschwind wie j mmerlich sie selber sind
7118658 wie nur n chstenmoral soll ich ben nur meinesgleichen soll ich lieben nicht die sonne nicht die tiere nicht blumen und kr uter nicht bewohner unbekannter welten und bessere gestirne es scheint mir dass bei euch im abendlande nur der mensch aus dem leben heraus und der natur gegen bergetreten ist denn immer handelt es sich um eure not eure sehnsucht eure erl sung
7118659 kein kirchliches christentum befreit vom patriarchat wie kurzschl ssige feministische theologie suggeriert christliche religion ist nicht zuletzt in ihrer best tigung einer fraulichen opferrolle nichts anderes als der ph notyp des patriarchats eine lupenreine auspr gung patriarchaler normen und handlungsmuster die es exemplarisch in sich hatte und hat herrschaftsfreiheit wird von den kirchlichen machttechnikern und ihren medien aber auch von den ber angepassten gl ubigen als sinnverlust gedeutet
7118660 die lateinamerikanischen befreiungstheologen fordern nicht die kirche sondern der mensch m sse im mittelpunkt des glaubens stehen
7118661 ich hoffe dass kein theologe es mehr wagen kann seine religion als hort der freiheit und des lebens auszupredigen ohne dass ihm die millionen toter begegnen die diese um ihrer machterhaltung willen opferte
7118662 es liegt auf der hand dass texte die zwei jahrtausende alt sind interpretierbar sind und sein m ssen

7118665 sehen wir uns um so stellen wir fest vorausgesetzt wir sind nicht blau ugig ein ugig blind jeder gewinn im menschlichen gef hl jede verbesserung der strafgesetze jede ma nahme zur verminderung der kriege jeder schritt zur besseren behandlung der farbigen jede milderei der sklaverei jede vernunftgem e erziehung und aufkl rung wurde zun chst von den organisierten gl ubigen bek mpft das christentum ist weit davon entfernt f r die im neuzeitlichen europa erreichte kultur des humanen verantwortlich zu sein es blieb in sachen humanit t ohne schrittmacherfunktion war der hauptfeind des moralischen fortschritts in der welt

7118672 die schlange konnte im paradies ebenfalls sprechen jesus trieb einmal d monen aus einem menschen aus und gestattete ihnen in schweine zu fahren auch wenn dies kein beispiel daf r ist dass d monen aus tieren sprechen zeigt es doch dass sich d monen mit der tierwelt identifizieren k nnen deswegen hatte vielleicht auch bileam in der vergangenheit bei seinen kontakten mit der geisterwelt sprechende tiere erlebt doch diesmal sprach kein d mon sondern der herr aus dem tier
7118673 wer pflanzt einen weinberg und isst nicht von seinem ertrag wer weidet eine herde und trinkt nicht von der milch der herde im gesetz des mose steht doch du sollst dem ochsen zum dreschen keinen maulkorb anlegen liegt denn gott etwas an dem ochsen sagt er das nicht offensichtlich unseretwegen ja unseretwegen wurde es geschrieben

7118732 just this morning us and iraqi negotiators announced theyve reached a deal to withdraw us troops from iraq
7118733 im sure that this will be approved by the parliament as soon as they come back from vacation and they get their act together
7118734 a draft agreement between the united states and iraq contains no fixed dates for u s forces to withdraw but iraq would like combat troops out by the end of 2011 government spokesman ali al dabbagh said on thursday
7118735 if the council agrees to the draft it will move to the political council for national security before going to the iraqi parliament which must approve the agreement before the u n mandate expires
7118736 towards the end of july after a secure video conference between president bush and prime minister maliki we announced that as part of any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral releationship would include aspirational time horizons goals for women iraqi troops begin to take over more of the combat mission in various parts of iraq which allow for more us troops to come home so any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
7118737 the shiite domination government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
7118738 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
7118739 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
7118740 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies

7118746 it wasnt the best round so i need to play a little bit better tomorrow and the rest of the playoffs
7118747 the way the points system is set up over these four weeks every round and every shot and every position matters because of the variance in points
7118748 so it may not look it this week but if i can fight out and play a good round tomorrow and move up and finish in the top 10 or 20 down the road if i happen to win it will give me more of a cushion or if i happen to play better the next couple of weeks it will better position me

7118765 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces
7118766 maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having number one next to me
7118767 maybe ive been playing a little bit of catch up all the way through the season
7118768 it took away maybe a grand slam took away 20 days of practice that is a lot for us
7118769 i have to take it a little bit more step by step ive been very consistent even this year in grand slams
7118770 rafa has played great so he deserves the number one position hes in a way the favourite now all of a sudden even on hard courts because hes played so so well
7118771 ive had some legendary matches here from me playing andre agassi in the final in 2005 or andy roddick
7118772 the night sessions its electrifying and the crowd have always been very good to me
7118773 so especially this year i hope maybe not playing my best tennis maybe this year they will come out and support me and carry me through to another u s open win

7118813 this morning was all about me getting into the flow of cadwell park on the airwaves ducati we tried quite a few different things but went through our normal free practice 1 procedure with everything going to plan we made a couple of changes for this afternoons practice but there are still some areas which need more work ahead of qualifying tomorrow im not exactly where i want to be right now but well be working hard to understand why and make improvements
7118814 its been great to get back on the airwaves ducati especially here at cadwell park right from the start of first practice the airwaves ducati has been good i have been struggling a bit on the last sector so tomorrow morning id like to look at gearing solutions its just a matter of finding a couple of tenths here and there but were not a million miles away from where i want to be in myself im feeling fine and looking forward to tomorrows qualifying
7118815 im really pleased with how today went my team has been working hard and my rizla suzuki is performing well we have just been making small changes fine tuning really and it is all going in the right direction i like cadwell park it is a real riders circuit and i think the new qualifying will keep things interesting for the fans and give us riders a bit more space on track bring it on
7118816 when i first came to cadwell i thought it was a scary circuit but now i am learning and it isnt so bad i need to work on my braking points and then i can go faster i want to stay inside the top 10 and i was there during both sessions today my aim for tomorrow is to go forward to the final qualifying session with a clear track british fans will see what watanabe can do
7118817 today has gone well for us and im very happy with how everyone has performed our rizla suzukis are on top form and havent missed a beat tom is on fire and atsu is really starting to show what he is capable of
7118818 tom has been working on some geometry changes to get his rizla suzuki turning even better he has covered race distance on a set of tyres and is still producing fast consistent lap times showing he has good race pace so it has been a very productive day on track for him
7118819 cadwell is about the toughest circuit that we will visit this year and atsu is rising to the challenge he has been running consistently in the top 10 and that is his aim for this weekend he just needs to get as many laps under his belt as he can and i think he will do us proud i feel there is more to come from everyone and we just need to keep that going into tomorrow
7118820 things are going well at the moment and weve done a lot of work with the bike making one or two changes and weve more to come
7118821 i enjoyed a winning double at oulton park last month and want the same again here to try and close down the championship and want to be in second place leaving here im only eight points down on that and am feeling confident ahead of these races

7118837 and its not restricted to building societies in mumbai its there in society in general its common knowledge that in certain areas of juhu and bandra land and houses are not sold to muslims im constantly surprised by how much religion matters to some people here perceptions of religion are always based on experience or fanaticism some elements have spoilt things for the entire community thats the sad truth about islam

7118843 ive been raised in a very liberal bohemian family in which religion has not played any part at all for me being a muslim really was about urdu about eating biryani and wearing shararas on id so the cultural aspect of me was muslim otherwise because i am not religious the religion did not matter after the riots following the babri masjid demolition i suddenly had people saying you are a muslim and hurling it as an accusation it was a self consciousness that i have never before experienced what it made me do is say yes i am muslim and what do you want to do about it that i can say is increasingly happening particularly in the western world a lot of young kids today are wearing the burqa are taking on an identity which really they dont feel just because when you push somebody against the wall thats what they come up with

7118875 the credit crunch has now fully started to hit consumers and net wealth conditions are at a record low as predicted last quarter equity markets and property prices have continued to fall and combined with high levels of consumer debt this has caused the financial reality index to fall to its lowest ever level

7118878 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7118879 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7118880 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7118881 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class

7118891 until philosophers intellectuals bear rule states and individuals will have no rest from evil
7118892 the distinction between an intellectual and a politician is an unintelligent one intellectuals and politicians go together because politics that is not driven by intellectuals is not powerful
7118893 although he has ambition it is hollow ambition which is not clothed in any greater understanding and intellectual appreciation
7118894 how many hoops do we have to jump through weve already spent 15 million of our own money on all the environmental studies
7118895 we have a lot of support from the public up here which is gratifying
7118896 they try and preach it to whoever comes in here
7118897 you dont play if you dont think youre going to win
7118898 we think were going to win every time out no matter who we face no matter who were playing individually and as a team so i dont think any of us are surprised that were here because were playing how we expect to play obviously it doesnt work out like that every year but if we actually play up to our own expectations you should be successful right now were playing well as a team and different guys are stepping up every night to get us wins
7118899 thats only going to help them for the future regardless of how the season plays out
7118900 theyre very quick to lift us up and tell us when we did well in our outings
7118901 very seldom do they air us out and make us feel like were not doing what they want us to do
7118902 but you cant be foolishly optimistic and put all your eggs in one basket
7118903 we knew we had enough piece of the puzzle here with mauer morneau and nathan
7118904 its even fun convincing the naysayers to think about investing
7118905 but a lot of people understand that even during challenging times theres still opportunity
7118906 theres such a negative perception of ethanol even though we present the facts
7118907 with high corn prices people think its a bad time to invest in an ethanol plant its been tougher than heck to get people to invest and thats unfortunate because its a really a good time to be building a facility
7118908 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7118909 this wont be much at all if a storm doesnt have a category in front of it doesnt worry us much
7118910 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7118911 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7118912 i thought good music was all you needed to break into the industry but thats not even close to the truth
7118913 there are probably 2 000 bands within 100 miles of where i live just everybody is in a band out here
7118914 i think everybody kind of had that pipe dream rock star kind of thing in the back of their minds
7118915 for me i was expecting to move out to california for the summer and then completely failing and moving back to north dakota
7118916 daily were finding more and more people are being turned on to their music and liking it
7118917 we started playing bars in middle river minn crookston thief river falls our favorite place to play was the long haul saloon in grand forks we did a couple of small music festivals we just kind of drove around played some songs drank some beers usually cover band stuff meanwhile everybodys going to school and working
7118918 we started playing the gloria gaynor song i will survive and they lost their minds
7118919 most of the time youre thinking why am i doing this nobody cares its like youre playing for the town drunk and his two buddies
7118920 we tried him out and found he was an absolutely amazing drummer and a really cool guy
7118921 i just learned everything from there and got to do whatever i wanted from the drum parts
7118922 there were a couple of things that separated them from other bands out here
7118923 they have a very distinctive front man in lucas their songwriting is head and shoulders above a lot of the bands out here and they have a lot of talent in what they are doing
7118924 it was kind of the right time to do it
7118925 basically we were going to break up and do our own thing and instead it was ok lets give it our shot and if it doesnt work we tried and if it does sweet
7118926 the day we signed papers with the lawyers was probably the day i thought this is getting serious
7118927 which is really a thing to say for a band guy hey ive got a lawyer but you have to have one nobody listens to anything unless a lawyer gives it to them
7118928 when you leave grand forks one of two things will happen
7118929 they will either resent you for it and stop talking to you or they will think youre really cool
7118930 the reality is that youre living out here broke you lose your social network and your support systems all you really have is the three guys in your band and yourself
7118931 its slowly grown to a point where you can feel the energy around us
7118932 when we first got out here we were playing in front of nobody and that slowly grew and slowly grew and its gotten to a point now where the radio interviews arent that exciting anymore weve done quite a few when we first did them we thought it was crazy that somebody would want to listen to what we had to say now we have to make it informative and entertaining and thats another thing we have to master thats another part of making it in the music industry
7118933 they are still the same four guys who came from north dakota but they are playing on such a much bigger scale
7118934 theres a long ways to go here its fun to be bouncing back and forth i mean it would be nicer to get up there where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can
7118935 hopefully well stay in this thing the whole way thats what we plan on doing and well go from there
7118936 everybodys been talking about this road trip and how we dont play as well on the road as we do at home
7118937 so to get off to a good start on this trip is definitely going to help us going forward into the next couple of series
7118938 he used his changeup well pitched on the inner half of the plate very well and gave our guys a chance to get going offensively
7118939 span and delmon had a heck of a night driving the ball for us
7118940 delmon got a pitch out and over the plate and he crushed that ball weve seen this guy do this a few times this year he can flip a ball up in the stands with the best of them
7118941 he pitched a good game but its more than just perkins its been the way for us the last nine games weve played terrific baseball for so long up to this point we just have to get back into our game
7118942 this is not anything thats going to take a major overhaul we just need a few tweaks here and there some guys are gripping the bat too tight squeezing sawdust out of it we just have to refocus and get back to playing the game

7119020 forming a development partnership with a top team both in terms of players as well as in professionalism in management means a lot to fucapo we focus on developing energy products for e sport having direct input and development support for our products helps us provide better products for the gaming community without the input from pro gamers we would never have focused on reducing the no of calories per serving or had truely understood the importance of reaction speed having players test out our new products under extreme pressure helps us develop the qualities needed on top level as well as for the casual gamers
7119021 we are proud to have a partnership with sk and we are sure this will turn into a beneficial relationship for the entire e sport community its a world class organization which boasts some incredible talented players and we hope our products will help them achieve even more in the future due to its brilliant international positioning the partnership with sk implies a more positive standing on our upcoming core markets
7119022 remind now im playing orc for so many games i understand orcs point of view very well
7119023 first game on lost temple i had an okay position to play but i let him creep a spot because i went to shop to buy stuff
7119024 i kept harassing him and fortunately killing a grunt i think this was a big loss for grubby i went mass bear without making any dryad and with my 2nd hero kotg i crept jack the healing fountain and got those great items
7119025 yea it is 200 gold and if orc has to make 1 more grunt they get a late tech which means they build lodge or other buildings a bit later
7119026 now im playing orc for so many games i understand orcs point of view very well
7119027 after losing all of my bears and heroes it was a big big comeback
7119028 i think the big point was i destroyed his lodge so he did not get many walkers

7119036 this club is a great club we play the same 4 4 2 formation as arsenal we have a great manager and staff and the crowd is fantastic too
7119037 that is why i am happy to come here and why arsene wenger was happy for me to come here too
7119038 i played a lot of football at arsenal in the reserves and not that much in the first team
7119039 you can see how different it is with a big crowd around you with more pressure on the games and that is what i like as i want to become a better player that is why i made this move i have come here to become a better player and to help derby win promotion and hopefully we can do that

7119079 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7119080 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7119081 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7119082 we dont send a message to anyone who hasnt initiated contact with the campaign and opted in

7119100 we could have the lord almighty be nominated and someone in this country will communicate to the committee something negative about that person

7119104 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7119105 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7119106 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7119107 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7119108 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7119109 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7119110 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7119111 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7119112 get your man in line in the house if this comes out of the senate
7119113 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right
7119114 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7119115 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7119116 now that the situation is changing in iraq they are heading to a new front which is the one in afghanistan
7119117 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7119118 in military terms i think we the french are pretty tough
7119119 our normal reaction to losing people is not to sit down and cry and then rush to the exits that is not the french way
7119120 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
7119121 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7119122 how about we do something that doesnt involve getting our heads spun off

7119124 one day every year people from all over the globe gather together in the streets intersections and neighborhood blocks to remind the world that we dont have to accept living in a car dominated society as the climate heats up this kind of event is the perfect way to take the heat off the planet and put it on city planners and politicians to give priority to cycling walking and public transport instead of to the automobile
7119125 have you driven by any of the entrances to the construction of the icc i have never seen so much legal notices posted do you think there is something going on here
7119126 the story goes like this bus drivers had always been warned to be aware of counterfeit coins also known as slugs from people trying to pass off this fake money in the coin collection tray
7119127 when slugging was in its infancy commuters stood at the bus stops waiting for a driver to pick them up bus drivers thinking these people were waiting for the bus would stop to pick up the passengers only to be waved off frustrating many of the drivers as this event became more and more frequent bus drivers began recognizing the real bus riders from the fakes because the people werent really waiting for the bus drivers began to simply call them slugs this definition seems to make sense because these people werent real bus riders or even real carpoolers in the usual sense of the word they were just as the name implies counterfeit riders or slugs hence the term was born
7119128 this is bulls t this is malarkey this is outrageous outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement

7119142 have you ever stood at the bus stop watching hundreds of cars go by and wondered just how many of those cars are headed to the same place you want to go wouldnt it be great if you could just stick out your thumb and get a quick ride rather than waiting 10 minutes for the old bus

7119146 i think anyone can look around and see the tremendous growth thats occurring between the dayton and cincinnati corridor up and down 75
7119147 this project is funding the beginnings of the cox road connector which is pretty important to the counties of warren and butler because thisll become hopefully what theyre envisioning an economic zone for both counties
7119148 if you look at work force and employment issues the entire i 75 corridor between dayton and cincinnati is becoming a singular market
7119149 we needed this location because of the access to i 75 and we needed a large piece of property that was available
7119150 number one if you look at the 75 corridor basically south of this site in west chester is basically all built out for larger industrial distribution and larger industrial sites so the availability wasnt there number two we were looking for other sites this site was incentivized with a 15 year 100 percent tax abatement already upon which is very unusual for southwest ohio
7119151 to the extent that the growth in warren county creates new jobs and business opportunities its very positive for the entire region
7119152 its always nice to create and net new jobs and thats what the state of ohio is looking to do create and net new jobs
7119153 i think were contributing to the growth in warren county because were creating jobs and seeing patients in addition were bringing partners so with all these partners on campus they bring new jobs new facilities and new customers
7119154 undeniably were seeing a hit of jobs but i think we have a good relationship with warren county
7119155 it creates opportunities for those losing their jobs at the gm plant or losing their jobs at wilmington
7119156 i think in a general sense by us working together and bringing jobs into montgomery warren and greene counties the idea is that theyll stay in those respective counties even if they work outside of the county

7119222 consumers need to be able to communicate in a safe environment with debt collectors
7119223 debt collectors are required by federal law and have been since 1977 to treat you the same way the wal mart greeter treats you with truth fairness dignity and respect
7119224 this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose
7119225 very very real need for debt collectors to take the publics perception of the industry very seriously

7119268 ive said before that he is very durable very consistent and he tries for you
7119269 you can see the size of him and he has a great will to win hes just a great horse
7119270 soft ground fast ground it doesnt matter hes able to take it he eats up every day and he loves racing riding horses like this
7119271 all the team have been amazing to keep him on the go and keep him happening
7119272 hes beaten but definitely not battered he ran a good race and is obviously on the way back
7119273 well regroup and im sure youll see a different horse in two weeks time im not using the good to firm ground as an excuse
7119274 its four group ones he has nearly won now and the other horse just got the measure of him up the hill
7119275 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7119276 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after
7119277 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7119278 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for do not make any efforts at reducing theirs
7119279 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries

7119293 i feel i played a decent round today i gave myself a lot of chances and i made him make birdies to beat me
7119294 i probably hit the ball better today than i have all week and i made a couple of putts
7119295 it was just that danny made more putts thats basically what it came down to
7119296 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7119297 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7119298 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7119299 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7119300 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7119301 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7119302 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7119303 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7119304 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

7119307 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7119308 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7119309 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7119310 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7119311 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido

7119313 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7119314 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7119315 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7119316 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7119317 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7119318 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso

7119321 during his transportation to the hospital williams began to regain feeling in his arms and legs at the current time he has regained almost normal neurologic function the evaluation at the hospital revealed a fracture of the c 3 vertebra and a significant ligamentous injury to the neck this injury will require surgical stabilization this weekend
7119322 the prognosis is very good for harry to return to normal neurologic function on that but it will require fusion of the spine before he can move forward from this
7119323 i think when we recovered is when we started hearing rumors that he was moving and that he was ok because as much as we wanted to win this game everybody loves harry loves his work ethic hes just a good person
7119324 harry is the hardest working guy on the team he was playing great on special teams he had battled to get to this point in his career i know he will work and be able to come back from this

7119327 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7119328 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7119329 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7119330 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7119331 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7119332 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7119334 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7119335 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7119336 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7119337 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7119338 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7119339 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7119340 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7119341 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7119342 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7119343 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7119344 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7119345 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7119346 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica

7119350 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7119351 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7119352 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7119353 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7119354 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7119355 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7119356 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7119357 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7119358 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7119359 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7119360 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7119398 one of the best young bands weve heard in a really long time
7119399 joe biden is uniquely served to be barack obamas partner for the change america needs
7119400 barack obama has chosen a running mate who above all doesnt believe barack obama is ready to be president and i couldnt agree more
7119401 joe biden said he would be honored to run with or against john mccain r ariz
7119402 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
7119403 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7119404 he can step right into the job people remember his foreign policy experience but hes also done a lot on crime on megans law on equal pay plus i think hell be a good campaigner i dont think joe biden will hesitate to take the gloves off
7119405 ideally what youd like the vice presidential candidate to do is to say things that the presidential candidate shouldnt say

7119409 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co california hypocritically talks new oil tax to stop legislators salary cuts
7119410 yes lord but even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs
7119411 thats the kind of way we were used to playing last year that was something we needed to see
7119412 that gives us a little confidence with the season around the corner
7119413 i tried to bait the guy a little bit but he did a great job and got underneath the ball
7119414 it was nice to see him regroup after the interception
7119415 to come out of the two minute situation with points is a positive that gave us a shot in the arm
7119416 we could have done a ton more we didnt go that deep in the playbook as long as we get into the rhythm and feel good about each other and what were doing the skys the limit
7119417 well probably start looking at cleveland probably more in depth now and start preparing for them
7119418 everything offensively went well passing game the run game just the way we moved the ball down the field

7119425 my message isnt just for disabled people it is for everyone
7119426 i felt pure joy that i had finally achieved after so many years of hard work winning the gold medal at the olympic games is the crowning glory
7119427 i am sick and tired of being sick and tired
7119428 the douchiest move since breaking up with a girl via text message
7119429 and then this its as if we were having really hot sex he was behind but then after he left i found out that while he was behind me he was leaving me a text message saying ive got a horse face
7119430 and were gonna make him do it in black face
7119431 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7119432 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7119433 60 are chicks and the 40 that are dudes are well sort of chicks
7119434 oh how i would have gathered you like a mother hen gathers her chicks
7119435 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7119436 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7119437 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7119438 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7119439 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7119440 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7119441 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7119442 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7119443 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7119444 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7119445 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7119446 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7119447 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7119448 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7119449 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7119450 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7119451 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7119452 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7119453 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7119454 v rone cest comme le vieux nice mais en 10 fois mieux
7119455 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7119456 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7119457 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7119458 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7119459 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7119460 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7119461 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7119462 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7119463 playing the drums makes the brain think in a way that very few activities can
7119464 being able to understand musical notes and dissect how rhythms work and go together is a very complicated thought process the most recent study shows that being constantly exposed to this type of brain activity can actually improve ones iq level
7119465 we all know that percussion is a great outlet for letting off steam and exhibiting creative energy recent studies however have shown that percussion and drumming in particular can boost the immune system which goes a long way towards reducing stress and improving ones health this is important information and as international drum month approaches were pleased to be able to share it
7119466 feelings of insight understanding integration certainty conviction and truth which surpass ordinary understandings and tend to persist long after the experience often providing foundational insights for religious and cultural traditions
7119467 rhythmic cues can help retrain the brain after a stroke or other neurological impairment as with parkinsons patients
7119468 an authentic experience of unity and physiological synchronicity if we put people together who are out of sync with themselves i e diseased addicted and help them experience the phenomenon of entrainment it is possible for them to feel with and through others what it is like to be synchronous in a state of preverbal connectedness
7119469 shamanic activities bring people efficiently and directly into immediate encounters with spiritual forces focusing the client on the whole body and integrating healing at physical and spiritual levels this process allows them to connect with the power of the universe to externalize their own knowledge and to internalize their answers it also enhances their sense of empowerment and responsibility these experiences are healing bringing the restorative powers of nature to clinical settings
7119470 drumming emphasizes self expression teaches how to rebuild emotional health and addresses issues of violence and conflict through expression and integration of emotions
7119471 the advantage of participating in a drumming group is that you develop an auditory feedback loop within yourself and among group members a channel for self expression and positive feedback that is pre verbal emotion based and sound mediated
7119472 i have a high regard for the coast guard because im aware of what they do and the risks that they take if you dont have times to get off a mayday then rescue 21 is helpful for people that use the water for pleasure and for commercial use probably the greatest asset the coast guard has had as a benefit for their use is rescue 21 the equipment saved my life
7119473 rescue 21 is a leading edge vhf fm radio system that replaces the outdated system from the 1970s
7119474 rescue 21 how it applies here in the puget sound area is that it gives the ability for the coast guard to monitor simultaneously different radio frequencies and direction find on those frequencies and provide assistance to the mariners out on the water
7119475 rescue 21 is a series of remote towers that are capable of transmitting receiving and direction finding
7119476 rescue 21 has been in the puget sound eattle area for approximately a year and a half to two years now and the system has proved itself to be very beneficial to us
7119477 we also have digital selective calling that is part of the system in essence that is a panic button on a radio that a mariner can hit and that automatically will send a distress message along with a position of where they are to the coast guard
7119478 our watchstanders utilize radio monitors and dual monitor displays on one monitor we have a chart that shows us where mariners are located according to their lines of bearing from the rff remote fixed facility anything that comes over channel 16 which is our distress frequency will appear red on the screen normal mariner calls will be in blue
7119479 we use this for search and rescue sar as well
7119480 in a sar case a mariner may only have the time to call help or mayday in a matter of a few seconds after receiving that transmission we are able to take the lines of bearing which provides a location showing where that person is
7119481 rescue 21 also gives us the ability to determine whether calls for help or maydays are real or a hoax
7119482 hoaxes cost the coast guard thousands of dollars each year using rescue 21 we are able to determine through the direction finding system if the call is coming from water or on land
7119483 the mayday hoax call was from a young child reporting that his boat was sinking
7119484 rescue 21 was able to direction find his location to the maple valley washington area
7119485 what this does for the coast guard is that it causes us to launch rescue units to go investigate and look in the area where we think the call came from
7119486 how we use rescue 21 on a hoax is it will produce a line of bearing where the call came from however it wont give us an actual position or it may not triangulate we may only get one bearing of call based upon its location and how the hills and mountains in the area affect the transmission
7119487 we will send a boat or helicopter which costs thousands of dollars per hour to operate to search for the person or persons we think are in distress
7119488 persons committing a hoax are subject to prosecution as a class d felony and could be liable for a 5 000 fine including all costs the coast guard incurs as a result of the individuals action
7119489 false distress calls not only cost taxpayers money and place coast guard members at increased personal risk but more importantly they divert limited resources from mariners who are in actual distress
7119490 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7119491 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7119492 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7119493 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7119494 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7119495 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7119496 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7119497 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7119498 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7119499 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7119500 after overcoming so much adversity in his life eric lamaze deserves gold
7119501 there are a bunch of country kids with olympic hopes in their hearts as they watched eric rise above it all and win big for canada
7119502 this is one of many excellent performances by canadians at the beijing olympics
7119503 if that person is relatively balanced sports psychology will work wonders but if they are put under real pressure it doesnt hold ground
7119504 i explain to the cyclists how their brain works get them to recognise when they are using parts which are not advantageous to them and get them to tune in to controlling it you are trying to reconstruct the personality and tap into the strength within the brain to contain the bits that have been hijacking you without you realising it

7119506 it was more likely that all four of the beatles would get back together than the verve reuniting as a band
7119507 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7119508 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7119509 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7119510 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7119511 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7119512 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7119513 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7119514 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7119515 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7119516 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7119517 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7119518 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7119519 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7119520 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7119521 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7119522 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7119523 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7119524 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7119525 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7119526 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7119527 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7119528 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7119529 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7119530 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7119531 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7119532 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7119533 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7119534 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7119535 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7119536 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7119537 just cos you put kittens in the oven it doesnt mean theyre muffins
7119538 hate is a really strong word i really really really dont like them
7119539 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7119540 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7119541 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7119542 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7119543 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7119544 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7119545 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7119546 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7119547 nach den uns vorliegenden informationen hat russland seinen r ckzug aus georgien begonnen aber nicht vollst ndig abgeschlossen
7119548 die bundesregierung erwartet dass russland den abzug jetzt unverz glich vollendet und seine truppen vereinbarungsgem auf die linien vor ausbruch der feindseligkeiten zur ckzieht
7119549 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7119550 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7119551 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7119552 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7119553 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7119554 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7119555 theres no sense in rushing getting ourselves in a bigger fix she cant hide and she cant go anywhere well find her
7119556 congressman cummings will lay the irrefutable truth on the table for an entire nation he is joining a host of maryland democrats who are leading our party as senator barack obama makes history in denver and more importantly as we put america on the right path again
7119557 we are very proud and excited so many maryland democrats will address the convention and the nation at this critical time in our nations history
7119558 if you know beverly byron youre going to do what she says shes been extremely helpful in this campaign and thats one of the other reasons were going to win this election

7119563 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7119564 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7119565 in all the years ive been writing theres only one genre thats really debuted in the
7119566 a fiasco at the state convention spawned the dueling delegations one for john mccain and one for ron paul and their continued wrangling has exposed a split in the party that may spell trouble in a key state for the presumptive republican presidential nominee
7119567 running a strident libertarian campaign in the primaries say the unbiased murdochians texas rep ron paul tapped a seam of republican frustration across the country railing against the bush administrations impact on civil liberties foreign policy and the growing federal government mr pauls message resonated particularly in nevada a state where frontier spirit and personal freedom runs deep and he captured second place in the january state caucuses ahead of sen mccain
7119568 her fears are not only for herself but also the people around her
7119569 i dnt no who the expletive u think u dealin wit u will neva be heard from one phone call is i gotta make now try me sho me
7119570 were doing the things necessary in terms of getting an organization and testing our possible donors
7119571 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7119572 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7119573 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7119574 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7119575 we dont send a message to anyone who hasnt initiated contact with the campaign and opted in
7119576 it is my firm belief that we can track terrorists we can crack down on threats against the united states but we can do so within the
7119577 the uk has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way
7119578 our hi tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
7119579 people are being allowed through on the basis of this technology it means that 95 per cent of people wont be checked in any way other than by the machine
7119580 instead of pressing ahead with new unproven technology to replace current immigration staff the government should answer our calls to establish a dedicated uk border police which is vital to securing our borders
7119581 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to bring to the table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7119582 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7119583 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7119584 gave in to the right wing of his political party and gave in to the swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7119585 a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7119586 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president looks exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7119587 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7119588 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7119589 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7119590 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7119591 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7119592 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7119593 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected

7119596 it was funny because i told them i had a surprise for them and they all thought practice was going to be called
7119597 that would really be a surprise if i did that thursday night we were meeting and i said you know im tired are you guys tired they said yeah were tired
7119598 i said how bout the hell with the meetings tonight lets go to the movies they looked at me like they didnt know how to take me i said we got three buses up there lets go theyre looking around as if is there a trick to this thing does he have it booby trapped not many actually asked what the movie was
7119599 they wanted me to come over and i said i was going to do a big cannonball but then i got tied up with the defense
7119600 my parents split when i was around seven years old and for a period of time there we sort of bounced between my grandmas house and some of my moms friends houses as a kid none of it made sense of course but i found myself sleeping on various couches for a year or so often falling asleep in one and waking up in another
7119601 its positive that the lad is so eager to get back on the field but in my view right now he is unable to truly contribute to the team
7119602 i have respect for roma so i really doubt i would celebrate if i scored
7119603 que ser mas com nmente conocido como rbol de la quina

7119605 i got horribly lost trying to find the venue this morning thanks to a completely useless my no it wasnt my fault for waking up late it was the map i tell you vincents session
7119606 my blog doesnt have all that many readers but theyre high quality readers
7119607 journalists tend have a certain level of disdain towards non journalists when it comes to writing on the web
7119608 good software allows for free play within clearly defined limits
7119609 facebook was so successful because it made social networking accessible
7119610 this will be a whole new ballgame at speeds you have never seen before
7119611 we met with president saakashvili of georgia and i think it was a very productive meeting he filled us in on what the russians have been doing over the last ten days
7119612 to keep his economy afloat over the next six months while they try to rebuild
7119613 i thought that we deserved at least a draw at half time
7119614 prince bauben has had a great chance and the goalie has made a great save and then morgaro gomis hits the post from point blank range almost and then we score a good goal so i thought at half time i thought we deserved to be at least level maybe if we had been a little bit luckier we might have been in front
7119615 but there was no indication of what was going to happen in the second half
7119616 we just didnt come out of the traps in the second half at all and right from the kick off we gave the ball away and that allowed motherwell to attack us and get on the ascendancy
7119617 and i didnt think we performed that great in the second half
7119618 probably for the first time since i have been at the club i can honestly say after the game i dont think we deserved to get a point today but we did and thats quite pleasing for me
7119619 hes made one save in particular well the penalty i thought was top drawer i think it was a decent penalty it was hit hard and hes anticipated it and got a good hand to it
7119620 obviously looking at it that has probably kept us in the game with the we way were playing but then if i look at graeme smith and the save he made from prince in the first half was top drawer and then the one at the end was even better because it was going in the top corner and we could have sneaked it
7119621 we could have nicked the three points right at the end but in football you dont always get what you deserve
7119622 it might have been a bit cruel for motherwell but i wouldve been delighted
7119623 with the performance i am happy i am unhappy with the finishing and if we only scored 50 or 60 percent of the chances we created we could have one 6 1 or 7 1
7119624 at the moment i dont like anything more only a win that is most important this team lost a lot of points last year and we must collect the points i think we play good football but we must work on the finishing
7119625 the team understand what i want we play football we dont kick and run we mover without the ball and we create the shots now we must learn to score and this is the only point i am worried about with the team
7119626 david obua is a very good football player but he wanted to show to everyone that he is okay and good and he had a very good chance with his head and he didnt do it but i think for the future this was not a bad choice to take david to hearts
7119627 kello was not so confident because goalkeeper is a special position and behind you is nobody and the harmony wasnt the best between marius zaliukis and berra and kello
7119628 but this is not possible because kello was here but zaliukas and berra were with their national teams also maybe if we find between the defence and the goalkeeper well have a very good goalkeeper
7119629 jamie mcdonald did not lose his place he was not in training he was with the under 21s and it is like a pre season for kello i need to give him a chance to play maybe against airdrie ill put ballogh in the goal right now we need to do everything to give the player a chance and this is the way
7119630 hes lost the weight you see when i came here and christian nade was 110kg about 17 stone and when i first saw nade he was making runs but he didnt run he walked
7119631 i felt our second half performance was a good one we created plenty of openings and should have scored two or three more
7119632 first half i felt we were a little too deep but there was a big difference in the second half
7119633 i would be worried if we were playing and werent creating but we are and hopefully that will continue
7119634 we limited inverness to chances only in the second half they were dangerous due to their power and height but overall i was pleased with the way we played
7119635 i had heard about our record of never having scored in inverness but im not interested in it we scored a great goal and should have had more no doubt about that
7119636 at the moment hes scoring and he gets those chances because of his willingness to get himself into good positions
7119637 overall im happy id have liked a second goal i thought our play deserved a second goal because at 1 0 their real threat came from corners and free kicks but the goalkeeper was excellent at handling crosses and the defenders were very brave and to keep a clean sheet youre always in with a chance of winning
7119638 if wed scored a second goal early enough we could have gone on to score one or two more there can be no doubt that we did enough to win the game
7119639 he was outstanding today hes designed for getting the ball down and making it happen
7119640 getting into a battle would suit hamilton so we were the team that got the ball down and passed and we wanted to get the ball to taouil so that he could get the ball early and cause the hamilton defence problems
7119641 he causes problems because he is so clever and strong with the ball at his feet and if we got the movement right which we did today we were always a threat against them but to be fair they stuck to their task and didnt make it easy but we were little bit better than them today
7119642 one of our problems last year was we lacked a bit of edge dig and steel in the middle of the park and we have that now he has great composure on the ball and when there is a ball to be won he invariably wins it great asset is he is very good in the air and of course is a help at set plays for and against
7119643 i thought we were very poor in the second half but youve got to give hibs credit because they are a good side who looked dangerous on the break
7119644 first half i felt we were positive and up for it and while hibs created a few chances i was quite happy with the way we played
7119645 the 30 seconds into the second half and we lose a goal and it just went from there really we simply didnt cause hibs enough problems
7119646 i think the game with clear cut chances in the second half especially the penalty and hitting the crossbar and even another chance right at the very end
7119647 we thought we had another penalty on the back of what we thought was a penalty claim and marc fitzpatrick should probably have scored but there you are its only the third game of the season
7119648 im totally satisfied with the performance and we just need to turn that performance into victories
7119649 but i feel we did enough to merit a win in the second half
7119650 yeah disappointed but pleased with the performance and pleased with a lot of individual performances and pleased with john sutton
7119651 he john sutton also made contributions in other ways he worked hard hes not nearly as fit as were going to get him and therefore hes got a bit more to come
7119652 must he die meet the muslim dissident who loves hello to members of this site please to have joined your forum jeycnhba rmctfni qwdg hnacmtry xshtv mjxa wilva

7119655 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7119656 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7119657 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7119658 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7119659 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7119660 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7119661 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7119662 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7119663 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7119664 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7119665 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7119666 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7119667 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7119668 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7119669 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7119670 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7119671 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7119672 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7119673 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7119674 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7119675 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7119676 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7119677 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7119678 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7119679 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7119680 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7119681 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7119682 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7119683 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7119684 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7119685 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7119686 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7119687 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7119688 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7119689 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7119690 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7119691 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7119692 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7119693 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7119694 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7119695 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7119696 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7119697 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7119698 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7119699 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7119700 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7119701 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7119702 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7119703 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7119704 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7119705 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7119706 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7119707 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7119708 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7119709 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7119710 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7119711 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7119712 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7119713 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7119714 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7119715 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7119716 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7119717 kalau ditanya cocok aku cocok sama dia kalau ditanya sayang aku sayang sama dia kalau ditanya baik dia baik
7119718 mudah mudahan dia randy bisa dapet yang terbaik entah dia dapet yang lain atau balik lagi sama aku
7119719 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7119720 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7119721 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7119722 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7119723 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7119724 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7119725 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7119726 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7119727 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7119728 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7119729 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7119730 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7119731 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7119732 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7119733 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7119734 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7119735 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7119736 this is a planning took where all things are going
7119737 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7119738 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7119739 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7119740 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7119741 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7119742 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7119743 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7119744 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7119745 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7119746 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

7119763 weve been over here many times and fallen short so im extremely impressed with the group he said
7119764 for a number of guys in the change room it was their first time over here representing australia playing the springboks on springboks soil so i was extremely happy with he way they performed
7119765 all 22 guys showed a lot of spirit determination and other than late in the game when we let them back in we had a fair bit of control throughout the whole game so it was slightly different to 2000
7119766 the boys got up and you look at history i guess and thats an indicator as to how hard it is coach robbie deans said

7119779 its not so much for his weight of runs more the fact that he was the one england player who is capable of changing a match
7119780 its been a great few days for the side after all the commotion i cannot ask anymore of them south africa have played some fantastic cirkcet and i think 2 1 is right at lords we had the upper hand and then for the next seven or eight day of test cricket south africa drummed it into us then on the last day at edgbason when grame smith scored his hundred we were beaten by a big man there
7119781 if i couldnt have asked more from the big man steve harmison i think it was a positive move its definitley the ay we and moorsey england coach want to play our cricket
7119782 i think we went slightly off the boil but you have to give credit to england we didnt bat in this test as well as we have in the series but weve waited a long time for this win we didnt bowl as well as we have had this year but weve won the pressure moments in the first two games
7119783 seen the sport at a distance but i rather need a closer look to appreciate the art of it

7119810 nee tuurlijk heb ik die 5 jaar ervaring niet je moet toch ergens beginnen
7119811 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course
7119812 whether i win or lose the impeachment the dignity of the nation would be damaged the office of the president harmed
7119813 i thought we were very poor in the second half but youve got to give hibs credit because they are a good side who looked dangerous on the break
7119814 first half i felt we were positive and up for it and while hibs created a few chances i was quite happy with the way we played
7119815 the 30 seconds into the second half and we lose a goal and it just went from there really we simply didnt cause hibs enough problems
7119816 our ambitions for the season must remain the same we have got to try and stay in this league
7119817 this is a very tough league to stay in we have seen already with stoke winning hull beating us the so called bottom teams are taking points already
7119818 we have got to be modest and humble and we know we have got to work as hard as we did today in every game to get a result whether you are playing the arsenal or one of the teams who are being tipped for relegation
7119819 if we can get that into our thick skulls then we stand half a chance
7119820 i thought the quality of our passing and movement matched the arsenals and im really delighted about that because if you get anywhere near to matching the arsenal that is something you have to be very proud of
7119821 i think we should take you to all our games last time you interviewed me we had just beaten portsmouth 1 0 to stay in the league and now we have beaten arsenal one of the very best teams in the league to show that maybe we have the pedigree and that we arent out of place here
7119822 i think the game with clear cut chances in the second half especially the penalty and hitting the crossbar and even another chance right at the very end
7119823 we thought we had another penalty on the back of what we thought was a penalty claim and marc fitzpatrick should probably have scored but there you are its only the third game of the season
7119824 im totally satisfied with the performance and we just need to turn that performance into victories
7119825 but i feel we did enough to merit a win in the second half
7119826 yeah disappointed but pleased with the performance and pleased with a lot of individual performances and pleased with john sutton
7119827 he john sutton also made contributions in other ways he worked hard hes not nearly as fit as were going to get him and therefore hes got a bit more to come
7119828 i thought that we deserved at least a draw at half time
7119829 prince bauben has had a great chance and the goalie has made a great save and then morgaro gomis hits the post from point blank range almost and then we score a good goal so i thought at half time i thought we deserved to be at least level maybe if we had been a little bit luckier we might have been in front
7119830 but there was no indication of what was going to happen in the second half
7119831 we just didnt come out of the traps in the second half at all and right from the kick off we gave the ball away and that allowed motherwell to attack us and get on the ascendancy
7119832 and i didnt think we performed that great in the second half
7119833 probably for the first time since i have been at the club i can honestly say after the game i dont think we deserved to get a point today but we did and thats quite pleasing for me
7119834 hes made one save in particular well the penalty i thought was top drawer i think it was a decent penalty it was hit hard and hes anticipated it and got a good hand to it
7119835 obviously looking at it that has probably kept us in the game with the we way were playing but then if i look at graeme smith and the save he made from prince in the first half was top drawer and then the one at the end was even better because it was going in the top corner and we could have sneaked it
7119836 we could have nicked the three points right at the end but in football you dont always get what you deserve
7119837 it might have been a bit cruel for motherwell but i wouldve been delighted
7119838 with the performance i am happy i am unhappy with the finishing and if we only scored 50 or 60 percent of the chances we created we could have one 6 1 or 7 1
7119839 at the moment i dont like anything more only a win that is most important this team lost a lot of points last year and we must collect the points i think we play good football but we must work on the finishing
7119840 the team understand what i want we play football we dont kick and run we mover without the ball and we create the shots now we must learn to score and this is the only point i am worried about with the team
7119841 david obua is a very good football player but he wanted to show to everyone that he is okay and good and he had a very good chance with his head and he didnt do it but i think for the future this was not a bad choice to take david to hearts
7119842 kello was not so confident because goalkeeper is a special position and behind you is nobody and the harmony wasnt the best between marius zaliukis and berra and kello
7119843 but this is not possible because kello was here but zaliukas and berra were with their national teams also maybe if we find between the defence and the goalkeeper well have a very good goalkeeper
7119844 jamie mcdonald did not lose his place he was not in training he was with the under 21s and it is like a pre season for kello i need to give him a chance to play maybe against airdrie ill put ballogh in the goal right now we need to do everything to give the player a chance and this is the way
7119845 hes lost the weight you see when i came here and christian nade was 110kg about 17 stone and when i first saw nade he was making runs but he didnt run he walked
7119846 prize an inspirational maori celebrity to come and talk to your early childhood education centre and school two prizes to be won
7119847 i had a spare period so i was just playing around
7119848 i got some help from some of the computer kids in my history class just for a bit of fun really
7119849 see the goodness of god in the land of the living
7119850 the challenge has nothing to do with gender the challenge has to do with coming to a new part of the world and learning a new culture a new language in part because i dont speak maori at the moment and learning to steer the good ship christchurch wherever god would have her sail
7119851 the anglican communion has had women bishops now for about 20 years i was the first in canada im kind of tired about all the talk about firsts i happen to be a woman who happens to be a bishop whats the point
7119852 the blessing of same sex unions is not in conflict with the core doctrine of the anglican church
7119853 i grew up in a very secular home my mother died when i was 13 i dont think i ever went to church with my family but there was a very strong anglican girls school that my mother had gone to and that they sent me to because it was the best education they could provide god bless them for that
7119854 when i was about 15 i heard a voice i dont think anyone else would have heard it but it was as clear as anything i heard a voice that said you are my beloved and you will be my priest and i will never leave you or forsake you i knew it was jesus
7119855 i was deeply excited within myself but i kept my mouth shut if i had told anyone i would have been laughed out of town
7119856 after 10 years as bishop of edmonton i decided i had taken them where i could take them and that new leadership would take them to new heights
7119857 so i said after a great deal of prayer that i was going to resign the diocese and wait and see what god had in store for me
7119858 excitement and delight and a firm prayer to god that were in this together you made this happen so dont leave me now
7119859 it was a profound gathering we went in with our differences but as time went on people began to see they needed to set aside their differences and stay together for the sake of the church thats not an exercise in futility
7119860 it makes you feel good about it makes you feel smart about it
7119861 they change prices slowly a little today a little tomorrow
7119862 to put on the record in case anything comes up its a cooperation case
7119863 a guilty plea must be voluntarily made by one competent to know the consequences of that plea
7119864 so that the record contains an affirmative showing that the plea was intelligent and voluntary
7119865 as true except to the extent that they are conclusively rebutted by the record
7119866 the victim was ordered into the bathroom only a few feet away and was not confined by cole
7119867 the only confinement involved is the sort that though not necessary to the underlying felony is likely to naturally accompany it
7119868 forcibly by threat or secretly confining abducting imprisoning or restraining another person without lawful authority and against her or his will
7119869 where appellant has objected to the proper amount of costs to be ordered
7119870 the burden of demonstrating the amount of costs incurred is on the state attorney
7119871 the normal consultation between attorney and client that occurs during an overnight recess would encompass matters that go beyond the content of the defendants own testimony matters that the defendant does have a constitutional right to discuss with his lawyer such as the availability of other witnesses trial tactics or even the possibility of negotiating a plea bargain
7119872 you can communicate just not concerning cross his testimony now that hes on cross examination unless thats concluded that doesnt mean you cant talk with your client at all just not concerning his testimony
7119873 the judge may instruct the lawyer not to coach his client
7119874 such as the availability of other witnesses trial tactics or even the possibility of negotiating a plea bargain
7119875 such discussions will inevitably include some consideration of defendants ongoing testimony
7119876 make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth
7119877 may direct that the examination of the witness continue without interruption until completed
7119878 arrange the sequence of testimony so that direct and cross examination of a witness will be completed without interruption
7119879 made or caused to be made under the imperative command of duty imposed by state law
7119880 mailings of documents which are required by law to be mailed and which are not themselves false and fraudulent cannot be regarded as mailed for the purpose of executing a fraudulent scheme
7119881 so far as appears the defendant mailed the notices that were the predicate for the mail fraud charges only because it was his official duty if he hadnt mailed the letters he would have been fired
7119882 the government must prove that legally required mailings were important to the successful execution of the fraud
7119883 personal travel using vehicles owned or leased by the company

7119885 westar had a well known practice of disclosing all compensation both cash and non cash of the top six executives of the company including defendants westars practice was to include amounts of less than 1 000
7119886 knowingly engag ing or attempt ing to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than 10 000 and is derived from specified unlawful activity
7119887 1 engaged or attempted to engage 2 in a monetary transaction 3 in criminally derived property 4 knowing that the property is derived from unlawful activity and 5 the property is in fact derived from specified unlawful activity
7119888 any property constituting or derived from proceeds obtained from a criminal offense
7119889 no person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsify any book record or account described in paragraph 2
7119890 i didnt think my personal use was material t he vast majority of my flights involved me traveling all over the place on business and flights that i thought were purely personal were a small fraction of that
7119891 knowledge can be inferred if the defendant deliberately blinded himself to the existence of a fact
7119892 for a total of 208 000 in chartered valued flights material
7119893 i f two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the united states or to defraud the united states or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years or both
7119894 conspiracy participant is legally liable for all reasonably foreseeable acts of his or her coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy
7119895 the failure of the mann act to condemn the womans participation in those transportations which are effected with her mere consent
7119896 the very individuals whose participation was required in every case
7119897 knowingly circumvent s or knowingly fail s to implement a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsif ies any book record or account described in paragraph 2
7119898 he proves that he had no knowledge of the violated rule or regulation
7119899 judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion
7119900 b y repealing the right to a determinate sentence that congress established in the sra the court has effectively eliminated the very constitutional right
7119901 to avoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary
7119902 all the things that troubled sixth amendment purists about the pre
7119903 exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range
7119904 o ur approval of discretionary sentencing schemes in which a defendant is not entitled to have a jury make factual findings relevant to sentencing despite the effect those findings have on the severity of the defendants sentence demonstrates that the defendant should have no right to demand that a jury make the equivalent factual determinations under a determinate sentencing scheme
7119905 we have some difficulty fathoming why the due process calculus would change simply because the legislature has seen fit to provide sentencing courts with additional guidance
7119906 did the defendant carry a gun during the drug transaction
7119907 i knew the gun was in there but i just didnt take it out
7119908 well established legal standards for discovery on a claim of selective prosecution
7119909 an affidavit indicating which of the other documents ordered for discovery do not exist
7119910 even if respondents failed to carry their burden of showing that there were individuals who were not black but who could have been prosecuted in federal court for the same offenses it does not follow that the district court
7119911 b ecause a selective prosecution claim is not a defense to the merits of a criminal charge but instead an independent assertion of misconduct discovery is not available pursuant to some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements of the defense discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent
7119912 o bviously a defendant need not prove his case in order to justify discovery on an issue
7119913 similarly situated individuals of a different race were not prosecuted
7119914 law enforcement referred only him and his co defendant billings for a federal prosecution that involved crack cocaine and failed to refer for federal prosecution eight non african americans who were arrested and prosecuted for crack cocaine
7119915 nationwide statistics demonstrating that the united states charges blacks with a death eligible offense more than twice as often as it charges whites
7119916 the government has never set forth the criteria for how a case is determined to qualify for psn prosecution
7119917 a concrete definition of what would constitute a similarly situated defendant based on the plain language of each respective statute being enforced
7119918 possess ing in or affecting commerce any firearm or ammunition
7119919 could have investigated whether similarly situated persons of other races were arrested and or prosecuted by the state of michigan and were known to federal law enforcement officers but were not prosecuted in federal court
7119920 i n a civil racial profiling case the similarly situated requirement might be impossible to prove
7119921 would not barring some type of test operation be able to provide the names of other similarly situated motorists who were not stopped
7119922 m erely demonstrating that better evidence cannot be obtained without discovery does not suddenly render otherwise insufficient evidence sufficient
7119923 t he requirements for a selective prosecution claim draw on ordinary equal protection standards
7119924 relies on erroneous findings of fact applies the wrong legal standard misapplies the correct legal standard when reaching a conclusion or makes a clear error of judgment
7119925 the original publicized plan for psn obviously did not espouse any discriminatory purpose
7119926 a discriminatory effect which is severe enough can provide sufficient evidence of discriminatory purpose
7119927 the conclusion would be irresistible tantamount for all practical purposes to a mathematical demonstration that the legislation is solely concerned with segregating white and colored voters by fencing negro citizens out of town so as to deprive them of their pre existing municipal vote
7119928 are based on a statistically unimpressive number of federal defendants
7119929 a poor attempt to cover up what they know is an unconstitutional practice
7119930 the similarly situated requirement does not make a selective prosecution claim impossible to prove
7119931 by requiring the defendant to produce specific evidence of an unprosecuted control group before granting discovery the court subjects the defendant to a catch 22 the defendant needs discovery to obtain the information necessary to entitle the defendant to discovery
7119932 selection of a particular community for a particular enforcement operation constitutes racial discrimination if it is foreseeable that because of the ethnic composition of the community one race will necessarily provide most of the governments targets
7119933 i t is well established that even a sensible and efficient use of the supervisory power is invalid if it conflicts with constitutional or statutory provisions
7119934 can minimize the risk to the government by holding the proceeding
7119935 discovery thus imposes many of the costs present when the government must respond to a prima facie case of selective prosecution
7119936 we have never determined whether dismissal of the indictment or some other sanction is the proper remedy if a court determines that a defendant has been the victim of prosecution on the basis of his race
7119937 we review the district courts decision to exclude expert witness testimony for abuse of discretion
7119938 the passions of a man but the mind of a child
7119939 does not tend to show either inducement or a lack of predisposition attributable to the tumor
7119940 outweighed by the dangers of confusing the issues misleading the jury and creating undue delay
7119941 would be extremely confusing to both the court and the jury
7119942 given the fact that the defense witnesses will then be rebutted by government witnesses
7119943 definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment
7119944 has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline
7119945 1 whether the scientific theory or technique can be and has been tested 2 whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication 3 whether there is a known or potential error rate and 4 whether the theory or technique is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community
7119946 the relevant reliability concerns may focus upon personal knowledge or experience
7119947 is based on specialized as distinguished from scientific knowledge the daubert factors are not intended to be exhaustive or unduly restrictive
7119948 applied an inappropriately rigid daubert standard to medical expert testimony
7119949 a good physician would in determining what is reliable knowledge in the medical profession
7119950 and thereby deprived him of a fair opportunity to defend himself
7119951 unfair prejudice confusion of the issues or misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence

7119953 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
7119954 we are very excited about this find we believe it will shed light on what luke was really trying to tell us so many years ago the chapter 15 passage in particular is very interesting
7119955 what sheep of you when you are lost does not leave the open country and go after the shepherd until you find him and when you have found him you jump on his shoulders rejoicing
7119956 this manuscript just lends further support to our wesleyan methodist theology at smu ever since john wesley himself we have believed that it is man who chooses god this manuscript which could be a copy of the original writing of luke himself supports our beliefs it is now clear that the sheep searches for the shepherd instead of the shepherd searching for the sheep

7119964 we gave it our all and we ran an olympic record and close to the world record
7119965 a lot of things happened here that we werent expecting that gives us a lot to work on for the world championships next year
7119966 i knew i had to pull out a supreme effort to help our team win and im happy we were able to do that i came to the olympics to win a
7119967 we wanted to come out with the new uniform a new fresh attitude and fresh outlook and go out there and prove our point that its not over yet
7119968 weve been overshadowed by the wonderful performance of the jamaicans but honestly weve had a very strong performance this year
7119969 ive been tested after every final session and a few preliminary sessions ive been doing since i got here and in singapore and at the training camp in palo alto
7119970 from the trials to now id say by a rough estimate theres been 40 tests thats a bunch but its part of the game and good for the sport to have it
7119971 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count we know were good we know were clean we work hard and any time you want to test us its ok
7119972 i did project believe with usada where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts and i have the results to prove it

7119978 biden has the stature and knowledge and the blue collar no bull pugnacity to call mccain on his imprudent militarism
7119979 joe biden again the consensus seems to be this morning joe biden a great pick for barack obama
7119980 in his first truly presidential decision barack obama acted like a president and chose a presidential caliber candidate for vice president i recently wrote that this choice would speak volumes about the kind of president he would be that if he choose one of the heavyweight contenders such as sam nunn or joe biden over the less qualified candidates it would be an enormously positive sign obama came through big time
7119981 the senator brings some real strengths to this ticket hes one of the most respected foreign policy minds in the senate something that was reaffirmed by his quick trip to the nation of georgia during the recent crisis there
7119982 i gather that what impressed obama about biden is that biden gets things done hes a man of action
7119983 biden ultimately shares and embodies one of the core convictions driving obamas campaign that democrats can win an argument about national security with republicans and shouldnt run from a fight on the topic or concede any sort of presumed gop superiority on it
7119984 the opws contribution is to provide flood protection to deal with the existing flood risk in the town of portarlington any protection works to development sites is a matter for the developer and the planning authority
7119985 i can see no way this can go ahead next week it also begs the question about whether or not our county council should be the planning authority in these areas
7119986 i cannot understand how laois county council granted planning permission for this site it floods on an annual basis theres pictures going back the last 20 years our house is close to the river and last week the water came up to our door almost there were more places flooded along patrick street that have never flooded before since all of the development along here
