2770048 summer is an excellent time for men and women of all ages to take advantage of the many health benefits of swimming nail care unfortunately many are embarrassed by the appearance of their dry heels or discolored toenail cares causing them to avoid activities such as swimming water aerobics or even experience the cooling freedom of wearing sandals or flip flops
2770049 regardless of what shape you re in there s no time like summer to make a commitment to eating right exercising and sprucing up your appearance

2770073 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2770074 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2770075 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2770076 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2770077 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2770078 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material
2770079 bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different
2770080 as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
2770081 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2770082 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before
2770083 he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious
2770084 my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
2770085 i find it interesting that youre a christian you used to be a muslim but you buy all your clothes like a jew
2770086 it was simple we never ever used my name we never told anybody it was me who was going to do the interviews we even had a fake title for the film we called it a spiritual journey it didnt work everywhere we went to salk lake city but no one would let us film there at all
2770087 larry charles theory is just keep going till they throw you out i guess he learned that on borat the crew would set up and at the last second when the cameras were already rolling i would show up so either theyd be seen on camera leaving the interview and lose face or theyd have to talk to me it was like and now heres bill you could usually see the troubled looks on their faces at the holy land theme park the pr woman freaked out and finally told us to leave she was definitely not a happy camper
2770088 the end of faith religion terror and the future of reason
2770089 god knows what could have been accomplished in this world if religion had never existed
2770090 thank you dear god whoever or whatever you are for allowing the lifeform me to be conscious and experience this odd thing we label life
2770091 religion ends and philosophy begins just as alchemy ends and chemistry begins and astrology ends and astronomy begins
2770092 since its obvious to anyone whose ever watched mahers act
2770093 ive failed for over 2000 years but i still believe
2770094 imagine the problems we can solve if we dont have the roadblocks that religion throws in front of us
2770095 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2770096 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2770097 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2770098 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2770099 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2770100 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2770101 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2770102 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2770103 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2770104 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2770105 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2770106 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2770107 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2770108 following the airstrikes tskhuinvali is virtually obliterated in these conditions our forces have relocated and assumed new positions
2770109 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2770110 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2770111 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2770112 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2770113 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2770114 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2770115 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2770116 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2770117 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2770118 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2770119 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2770120 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2770121 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2770122 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2770123 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2770124 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2770125 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2770126 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2770127 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2770128 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2770129 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2770130 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2770131 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2770132 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2770133 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2770134 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2770135 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2770136 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2770137 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2770138 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2770139 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2770140 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2770141 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2770142 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2770143 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2770144 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2770145 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2770146 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2770147 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2770148 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2770149 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2770150 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2770151 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2770152 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2770153 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2770154 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2770155 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2770156 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2770157 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2770158 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2770159 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2770160 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2770161 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2770162 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2770163 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2770164 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2770165 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2770166 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2770167 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2770168 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2770169 who are open to doing something on the production side
2770170 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2770171 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2770172 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2770173 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2770174 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2770175 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2770176 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2770177 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2770178 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

2770180 reminded mason of the summer toads at the farm always biding their time beneath a floodlight or brightened transom vigilant brown lumps watching watching watching watching waiting for a gnat or moth to dip too deep and become food for a sticky darting tongue
2770181 summer is an excellent time for men and women of all ages to take advantage of the many health benefits of swimming nail care unfortunately many are embarrassed by the appearance of their dry heels or discolored toenail cares causing them to avoid activities such as swimming water aerobics or even experience the cooling freedom of wearing sandals or flip flops
2770182 regardless of what shape you re in there s no time like summer to make a commitment to eating right exercising and sprucing up your appearance
2770183 feet and legs are on display nail careduring the warmer months and are a age give away if not pampered a bit and tended to

2770185 85 000 miles tell them they need a new fuel filter
2770186 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2770187 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2770188 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2770189 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2770190 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2770191 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2770192 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch

2770274 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar
2770275 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character
2770276 you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
2770277 we changed the words and he redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
2770278 one movie where the aesthetics of physical production and the aesthetics of virtual production are to the extent that we could do it pretty much it identical
2770279 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production
2770280 we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
2770281 ive seen very little footage so i dont really have a feel for it i hope they do well and i hope it is a huge hit i do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen that is what james cameron created
2770282 i still dont know how it will play out with this one they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how the strong the movie will be
2770283 i dont know how much im allowed to say but im a very bad person
2770284 i can tell you that linda is a big fan of t1 and t2 and would be very interested in hearing about participating in the new film
2770285 figuring out a way to shoot around labeoufs injury kind of write it in the story
2770286 theres no reason why we necessarily have to use the same three or four that are still around
2770287 i mean batmans got a wide variety a rogues gallery certainly we used two in the first movie that hadnt been in the films before
2770288 its really up to chris to decide and he has not decided whether or not he wants to go back to the well again
2770289 and if he does i you know would be honored to work with him
2770290 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2770291 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2770292 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2770293 10 20 40 other conceptualizations of gort and what we realized was that retaining an essentially human form was necessary because retaining the relationship between gort and klaatu was a necessity
2770294 the problem is what del toros talked about to me is that hellboy iii would be the end of hellboy
2770295 my hellboy is not going to have kids mignola added
2770296 my hellboy is going to die but i want to be the one who does that and if del toro does my ending there wont be a lot of surprise when i get to the end of the comic
2770297 i think its somewhere in a true lies type world almost with big exciting action but the relationships are all very personal and thats where a lot of the comedy comes from
2770298 i think that from a progress standpoint its probably gone a little bit slower than what we would have expected you cant control these strikes and so on
2770299 not only did it do well on the air it did phenomenally well in the international and dvd market
2770300 a disproportionately larger amount of money from foreign and dvd money
2770301 i think it is the holy grail for us in which we get high quality programming for a lower license fee
2770302 but i think the vast majority of fans their greatest hope and desire is to see the hero and heroine they love brought to life on screen
2770303 i think what readers read the story for is because they want to watch and follow characters that they love and hate
2770304 they want to be with those characters and follow that story and know whats going to happen exactly what those characters do isnt as important
2770305 if the characters are great characters and you want to journey with them the story is secondary
2770306 every time i do a new like saying a new book couldnt possibly work because the readers read the previous book and why would they read more stories about the characters its the characters that are important
2770307 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
2770308 my goal was to put this mans entire family at risk if he did anything wrong
2770309 im appalled that a judge would let a sexual predator out on the streets

2770312 nach dem nicht optimalen qualifying haben unsere piloten alles versucht um ein gutes ergebnis in zolder herauszuholen jean karl vernay und martin plowman ist das mit einer tollen fahrt gelungen
2770313 volkswagen bestreitet die erste komplette saison in der formel 3 und hat seine premiere beim masters in zolder erlebt wir werden die erfahrungen gegen starke internationale konkurrenz mitnehmen weiter daraus lernen und hart an uns arbeiten jetzt bereiten wir uns auf die mit einer l nge von nur 1 929 kilometern sehr spezielle strecke in brands hatch vor
2770314 ich habe die chance auf ein gutes resultat schon im qualifying vergeben als ich zuerst in verkehr geriet und bei meinem zweiten versuch keine perfekte runde schaffte mein rennen war heute nach einer kollision schnell vorbei
2770315 eigentlich f hle ich mich hier in zolder sehr wohl aber an diesem wochenende hat einfach nichts gepasst im qualifying h tte ich vielleicht die vierte reihe erreichen k nnen wurde aber von einem langsameren auto behindert die abstimmung f r das rennen hat nicht hundertprozentig funktioniert meine hinterreifen haben zu schnell abgebaut sodass ich in der schlussphase nicht mehr attackieren konnte
2770316 es war meine premiere im team signature deshalb musste ich mich erst einmal an das auto und die abstimmung gew hnen im nassen war ich relativ schnell bei der musik aber auf trockener strecke fehlte mir die zeit f r eine optimale abstimmung nach dem misslungenen qualifying musste ich angreifen und konnte auch eine ganze menge positionen gutmachen das ist immerhin ein kleiner erfolg
2770317 im vergangenen jahr bin ich hier in zolder aufs podium gefahren deshalb hatte ich mir auch an diesem wochenende einiges ausgerechnet im qualifying sind wir nicht gut zurechtgekommen aber im rennen f hlte sich das auto sehr gut an ich habe fast 20 positionen gutgemacht das macht mir mut und hoffnung f r den n chsten lauf der formel 3 euro serie ende august in brands hatch
2770318 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2770319 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2770320 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2770321 es wurde pl tzlich immer rutschiger und ich bin leider gest rzt ber das vorderrad dann wurde zum gl ck f r mich abgebrochen und ich konnte beim zweiten rennen noch mal mitfahren anfangs war ich schon drei sekunden hinter joey und bin nur schwer ins rennen gekommen aber dann hatte ich ein immer besseres gef hl und kam wieder heran konnte joey sogar noch mal berholen zuletzt habe ich noch einen fehler gemacht und bin dann als dritter ins ziel gekommen joeys rger kann ich verstehen ich habe bei der zieldurchfahrt selbst nicht gewusst dass ich gewonnen habe
2770322 sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past for this i will give you a life span of twenty years
2770323 entertain people do tricks and make them laugh for this i ll give you a twenty year life span
2770324 monkey tricks for twenty years thats a pretty long time to perform how about i give you back ten like the dog did
2770325 you must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun have calves and give milk to support the farmers family for this i will give you a life span of sixty years
2770326 thats kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years how about twenty and ill give back the other forty
2770327 eat sleep play marry and enjoy your life for this ill give you twenty years
2770328 only twenty years could you possibly give me my twenty the forty the cow gave back the ten the monkey gave back and the ten the dog gave back that makes eighty okay
2770329 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2770330 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2770331 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2770332 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2770333 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2770334 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
2770335 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
2770336 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
2770337 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
2770338 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
2770339 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
2770340 han empezado a insultar a amenazar y a cantar barbaridad tras barbaridad

2770360 i guess i just lost my husband i dont know where he went so im gonna drink my money im not gonna pay his rent nope i hate marriage
2770361 i dont need you and guess what im havin more fun and now that were done im gonna show you tonight im alright im just fine
2770362 i would like to have wishful thinking and say yes only time will tell i hope we maintain a friendship and who knows what will happen when we get older for the next three years were both extremely busy people so its tough
2770363 you cant tell me were not doing anything to develop nz football
2770364 if we werent here where would shane smeltz be playing in the english lower leagues weve brought them back and look how theyre blossoming to the extent that premiership teams are showing interest in our players
2770365 and try telling the 12 000 people who turned up to every home match last season were not doing anything for new zealand football id invite ryan to come here and see for himself
2770366 do blackburn rovers go out and sign a whole bunch of young english players just so the national team does well of course not they are out to win the premier league and we are out to win the a league
2770367 terry is putting in 5 million a year to run the club to ask him to fork out that money to be a development club is ridiculous
2770368 we were asked to release them for five weeks ryan is only away for 10 days and is only playing two of the three matches
2770369 you dont get to do too much tackling out in the centres and generally when youre playing on the wing you just catch cold but it was fun and im excited to be playing rugby
2770370 i got a little bit too excited at one stage but it was just a good feeling being out there and playing
2770371 im a professional sportsman and i know what i need to do to get out there and perform to my best
2770372 ive just concentrated on what i have to do and thats learning the game learning what the team is trying to do and learning my role within the team
2770373 im fully focused im a rugby union player now and ive got goals that ive set so this is just the start hopefully to a long and successful rugby career
2770374 theres short term goals and theres long term goals like playing for the all blacks
2770375 i want to become a dominant no 13 and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that tana has shown in me by getting out there and helping his team
2770376 one hundred per cent its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
2770377 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
2770378 i think probably a forward going into the forwards would be a lot more difficult because theres a lot of things that are different
2770379 in the backs its still hard because of all the technical things its not as easy as people think
2770380 its just all the little things i have to pick up the rucks the positional play the calls and the moves
2770381 it was sleeting the wind was absolutely freezing and showers were coming through some of those thin girls were just blue
2770382 the kids hands were red and their legs bright blue children shouldnt be treated like that
2770383 but they stuck at it and were alive at the end
2770384 i was shocked they did not think of the girls safety their hands were numb so they were using wrists to try and catch the ball
2770385 i knew it was pretty bad as soon as i hit the car
2770386 i was sort of hoping i could just get a discharged without conviction during the court case i was pretty worried about having that over my shoulders
2770387 the canadian authorities can use that as a basis for denying a visa
2770388 there are a significant number of vendors who have mounting pressure on them to meet the market as mortgage repayments on top of increased costs of living start to bite
2770389 this change of position reflects a greater understanding and acceptance of the property market and the wider economy
2770390 there are many examples of significant losses being realised currently
2770391 because of the sheer volume that is on the market the people who want to sell quicker need to drop their prices to be more competitive
2770392 the ones that are most motivated will drop the most so there are some good buys out there

2770522 over time the children involved in this kind of disruptive behaviour have become younger and the behaviour has become more extreme
2770523 that is clearly a concern because we need to do something urgently about this to make sure as they get older it doesnt become more difficult
2770524 the threshold in schools has got higher because we all know that we are being told that you cant just stand those kids down all of the time
2770525 it is not out of control but its certainly creating some very difficult issues for schools to address
2770526 the children were into competing big time that was their motivation

2770562 in a defensive or strategical point of view fort sumter radiates its fire through all the channels from the sea approach to charleston and has a full sweep of range in its rear or city side the fort is sufficiently out of range from a land artillery attack se that all apprehensions for breaching it from that source may be put at rest the maximum range of the guns from sumter is three miles but for accurate firing sufficient to hull a vessel the distance would require to be reduced one half of that figure the war garrison of the fort is six hundred men but only seventy nine of that number are within its walls

2770601 la acusaci n que se est haciendo contra men ndez y bussi tiene de importante que se hace una rese a hist rica impecable tiene algunos errores y olvidos que no son criticables porque fue un gran trabajo pero lo trascendente es que da por comenzada la tarea represiva en 1974 esto es una cosa extraordinaria que no se hab a hecho antes porque debe haber gente interesada en que no se hable de antes del 24 de marzo

2770615 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2770616 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2770617 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2770618 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2770619 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2770620 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2770621 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2770625 in talking with the training staff they seem to think hes going to be ok
2770626 well know more the closer we get to that date
2770627 i have been training a lot with my brother to achieve this win
2770628 the main rules have not changed since the beginning of the competition 10 years ago we have six men or women sitting inside the sauna on each round and the winner is the last one to leave
2770629 there are no world records we cannot control all the factors like the temperature of the sauna or the water thrown into the stove
2770630 this person is going to engage in ritualized behavior whether you like it or not so early on give them your rituals in a clearly defined and fun expectation they just need to grab some ritual and would you rather have them participate in yours or the ones they come up with if left to their own devices
2770631 im just sittin here watchin the wheels go round and round i really love to watch em roll
2770632 billy has been great through the work hes done on and off the field
2770633 part of it is the character the other part is the performer
2770634 billy the marlin is a good looking character he garners a lot of attention and hes had a positive impact for the team organization and city
2770635 thank god my assistant is now a hallandale beach fla police officer
2770636 after we won from nov 1 to the middle of january we had a string where the marlins had about three or four appearances a day and i ended up losing like 35 pounds so i was really skinny when they measured us for the rings
2770637 but when they finally came in i had put back on my normal weight and i couldnt even wear it
2770638 hes able to connect with the kids so well he makes that connection and it resonates every time
2770639 billy is a huge asset to our organization hes very valuable
2770640 the best part is when you go to a birthday party and all the kids come and hug you
2770641 then you have those kids in the back who are too shy those are the kids i target as the day passes and my goal is to win over their hearts before i leave if they do it was a good day
2770642 to be a good mascot you have to be entertaining but you also have to be accessible
2770643 the marlins have always made sure billy the marlin has been that
2770644 walking into the opening ceremonies the other day it did give me chills because i have always been a fan of the olympics and a fan of usa baseball
2770645 being here with the chance to wear the uniform and the colors it is a great feeling it is something that you really dont think you will ever get to be part of and it is very special to me i know were very excited to get the games going and get some spectators in here
2770646 a lot of the older guys we know what it takes to get our bodies ready for a game
2770647 we have played against each other we know each other and there is a lot of familiarity the young guys we dont know as much but we sit there and watch them play and they have a heck of a lot of talent
2770648 he said the baseballs so so but the moneys good minor leaguers dont make a whole lot of money that was the deciding factor
2770649 tampa bay called my agent and said can you get him back over here well sign him to triple a
2770650 it was funny because our offices are right there in durham
2770651 i watched the triple a all star game and jeremy pitched a scoreless inning he walked off the mound with an attitude and maybe it was just me reading into it but he had that look like you guys made a mistake you could just see it
2770652 when i called him timing was an issue i said do you hear that sound he said what sound i said thats opportunity knocking do you want to take advantage of the chance it was very quick and simple i already knew the character of the guy we talk about a lot of players we were putting a puzzle together
2770653 this was my opportunity finally calling me like paul said on the phone
2770654 its been a lot of fun a long summer but im enjoying every minute of it i didnt really know what my chances were getting on the team and its definitely the highlight of my career so far
2770655 the pro game is a lot different than the college game
2770656 just playing with these guys is giving me a lot of insight hopefully for what is in store at the next level like with the pitchers i just talk with them mainly about stuff outside of baseball how it is for them being out on the road day to day and everything they have to do to get ready to pitch on their given day
2770657 after the canada netherlands exhibition game tonight both teams did the old school line and shook hands at home plate really a cool thing to see can you see the yankees and red sox ever doing that
2770658 in the village you are at the food court and you walk around and you see all these great athletes
2770659 i just try to sit down with somebody different every day get to know them and see how their culture is and something you have to take advantage of it is something you are not going to be able to do again its a great honor to be amongst all the athletes and it is fun to learn their ways and learn what theyre about

2770683 it is quite a delicate balance that is being faced and members realise they are in the front line
2770684 our scrum dominated and im not sure why we gave away a couple of penalties they were ruling that we were diving in and dominant scrums dont tend to do that
2770685 im really interested to talk to steve we obviously had a disconnect there our interpretation was that we were a dominant scrum looking to create a bit of pressure and it seemed to me that they otago were looking to drop it
2770686 there was a wee bit of that steve was concerned about the number of penalties we were giving away and id like the opportunity to just discuss a couple of those with him because i think if we had another look at them he wouldnt have given them
2770687 therefore the pressure wouldnt have been on us not to give them away and things kind of compounded for that reason
2770688 its just an utter tragedy its as simple as that theres nothing to hang it on its just a crazy man
2770689 how do you live with that how do you live with any of it the mind just doesnt want to comprehend any of it really its just so random and incredible

2770697 that was probably our worst half of football all year and in a final against a team as good as linwood you cant afford to do it but it was a very proud day for me to see the effort the boys put in
2770698 there was some very cold air coming up from a long way south
2770699 this purchase puts government relief for social housing in jeopardy it is much harder to ask for money to help the council out when it apparently has 17m available for a property developer
2770700 how can the council find 17m to bail out a property developer when it could not find money to help the most vulnerable residents in council owned social housing and rushed through a rent increase of 24
2770701 the purchase at market rates has to be seen against the alternative of allowing the properties to go on the open market in the current market the council could have picked them up for a much lower price than market rates it looks like the council is quick to help out property developers and slow to help out its most vulnerable and struggling residents
2770702 the three day time limit sounds like an encyclopedia salesman who says you have to buy them now or the deal is off
2770703 tenants will find it particularly galling to have been told by council that there was no alternative to savage increases in their rents yet now money can be found to bail out a property developer
2770704 its a busy and popular route but we see it as under served because theres no low fare option
2770705 expansion is not driven by anything other than the fact that the business model is working well and there seems to be buoyancy in those markets that should enable us to do what weve done in all the other markets which is grow them

2770731 kami telah memberithukan bahwa rusia sudah merencanakan untuk memindahkan beberapa unsur dari armadanya di laut hitam ke abkhazia ke ochamchira seolah olah untuk melindungi warga sipil mereka sepasang kapal penjelajah atau kapal skala besar angkatan laut
2770732 dari sisi abkhazia ada beberapa serangan diupayakan semua serangan itu dipukul mundur

2770907 has been poorly thought through badly implemented and has produced many unintended costs that will linger for years if not decades but blanket criticism of bush misses an important reality
2770908 whatever reasons and through whichever path the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream in many cases the next president should follow rather then reverse them
2770909 the administration that became the target of so much passion and anger from democrats republicans independents foreigners martians everyone is not quite the one in place today the foreign policies that aroused the greatest anger and opposition were mostly pursued in bushs first term the invasion of iraq the rejection of treaties diplomacy and multilateralism in the last few years many of these policies have been modified abandoned or reversed this has happened without acknowledgment which is partly what drives critics crazy and its often been done surreptitiously it doesnt reflect a change of heart so much as an admission of failure the old way simply wasnt working
2770910 consider as a symbol of this shift bushs appointment of the world banks president his first choice for the job was paul wolfowitz an arch neoconservative with little background in economics but by the time wolfowitz was forced to resign and the post opened up again bush realized that he needed a less ideological choice and he picked the highly qualified and respected robert zoellick where dick cheney was once the poster child for the administration today policy is being run by condoleezza rice robert gates stephen hadley and hank paulson all pragmatists change has not extended to all areas and in many places its been too little too late but that there has been a shift to the center in many crucial areas of foreign policy is simply undeniable
2770911 that president of course was george w bush his decision to blindly repudiate anything associated with bill clinton is what got us into this mess in the first place lets hope that the next president no matter how much he despises bush will take a careful look at his administrations policies americas interests and the world beyond and do the right thing for the country and its future

2770933 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge

2770948 as you may know the democratic national convention is just a couple of weeks away it was four years ago at the same gathering that america heard a fine speech from an illinois state senator named barack obama hes done pretty well for himself since then and the smart money in denver is on another celebrated performance but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall in the way of running mates sen obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2770949 in recent days weve seen two stark examples of exactly whats wrong with washington and whats at stake in this election first we learned that the federal budget deficit could reach nearly half a trillion dollars next year the second thing we learned this week was that the iraqi government now has a 79 billion budget surplus thanks to their windfall oil profits i believe that we need to move in a new direction this is a defining moment in our history we can either continue down a failed course or we can choose a better future

2771019 my friend ive known all along which path you were to take but if i had shown you right away you would not have been ready to take it what at first seemed random objects have now prepared you to take your appointed path
2771020 im not tired but the sooner i go to bed the sooner 8 00 comes around
2771021 we know they have strong swimmers australia is really a nation to consider
2771022 the average person says i know ill be happier with a porsche than a chevy
2771023 you know the stones said you cant always get what you want
2771024 i dont think thats the problem the problem is you cant always know what you want
2771025 for a moment gilbert forgot his troubles and two more questions came to him do we even know what makes us happy and if its difficult to figure out what makes us happy in the moment how can we predict what will make us happy in the future
2771026 i pulled weeds i sold rebar i sold carpet i installed carpet i spent a lot of time as a phone solicitor
2771027 one of the most gifted social psychologists of our age
2771028 and i say why study anything else its the holy grail were studying the thing that all human action is directed toward
2771029 when really bad things happen to us we defend against them
2771030 people of course predict the exact opposite if you ask what would you rather have a broken leg or a trick knee theyd probably say trick knee and yet if your goal is to accumulate maximum happiness over your lifetime you just made the wrong choice a trick knee is a bad thing to have
2771031 our research simply says that whether its the thing that matters or the thing that doesnt both of them matter less than you think they will
2771032 things that happen to you or that you buy or own as much as you think they make a difference to your happiness youre wrong by a certain amount youre overestimating how much of a difference they make none of them make the difference you think and thats true of positive and negative events
2771033 happiness is a signal that our brains use to motivate us to do certain things and in the same way that our eye adapts to different levels of illumination were designed to kind of go back to the happiness set point our brains are not trying to be happy our brains are trying to regulate us
2771034 we dont realize how quickly we will adapt to a pleasurable event and make it the backdrop of our lives when any event occurs to us we make it ordinary and through becoming ordinary we lose our pleasure
2771035 the thing im most interested in that ive spent the most time studying is our failure to recognize how powerful psychological defenses are once theyre activated
2771036 weve used the metaphor of the psychological immune system its just a metaphor but not a bad one for that system of defenses that helps you feel better when bad things happen observers of the human condition since aristotle have known that people have these defenses freud spent his life and his daughter anna spent her life worrying about these defenses whats surprising is that people dont seem to recognize that they have these defenses and that these defenses will be triggered by negative events
2771037 i am like everyone in thinking ill never get over this and life will never be good again
2771038 but because of my work there is always a voice in the back of my head a voice that wears a lab coat and has a lot of data tucked under its arm that says yes you will and yes it will and i know that voice is right
2771039 i fell into a trap i never should have fallen into
2771040 so much of our lives involves making decisions that have consequences for the future
2771041 and if our decision making is influenced by these transient emotional and psychological states then we know were not making decisions with an eye toward future consequences
2771042 these kinds of states have the ability to change us so profoundly that were more different from ourselves in different states than we are from another person
2771043 you establish your turn back time and then you find yourself still far from the peak
2771044 so you push on you havent brought enough food or clothes and then as a result youre stuck at 13 000 feet and you have to just sit there and shiver all night without a sleeping bag or warm clothes when the sun comes up youre half frozen and you say never again then you get back and immediately start craving getting out again
2771045 if people do not know what is going to make them better off or give them pleasure
2771046 then the idea that you can trust people to do what will give them pleasure becomes questionable
2771047 we consider people capable of giving informed consent once they are told of the objective effects of a treatment
2771048 but can people anticipate how they and other people will react to a colostomy or to the removal of their vocal cords the research on affective forecasting suggests that people may have little ability to anticipate their adaptation beyond the early stages
2771049 windfalls are better than pratfalls as are better than cs december 25 is better than april 15 and everything is better than a republican administration
2771050 just because we figure out that x makes people happy and theyre choosing y we dont want to impose x on them i have a discomfort with paternalism and with using the results coming out of our field to impose decisions on people
2771051 if you had a deep understanding of the impact bias and you acted on it which is not always that easy to do you would tend to invest your resources in the things that would make you happy
2771052 but i should have learned many more lessons from my research than i actually have
2771053 im getting married in the spring because this woman is going to make me happy forever and i know it
2771054 i dont think i want to give up all these motivations
2771055 that belief that theres the good and theres the bad and that this is a contest to try to get one and avoid the other i dont think i want to learn too much from my research in that sense
2771056 hope and fear are enduring features of the human experience
2771057 and it is unlikely that people are going to abandon them anytime soon just because some psychologist told them they should
2771058 the benefits of not making this error would seem to be that you get a little more happiness
2771059 when choosing between two jobs you wouldnt sweat as much because youd say you know ill be happy in both
2771060 maybe its important for there to be carrots and sticks in the world even if they are illusions
2771061 they keep us moving towards carrots and away from sticks
2771062 as bad as this administration has been its going to take more than just a change in parties to truly turn this country around
2771063 there are those who tout their experience working the system in washington
2771064 but the problem is the system in washington isnt working for us and it hasnt been for a very long time
2771065 a lot of people whove been in washington a lot longer than me theyve got better connections they go to the right dinner parties they know how to talk the washington talk
2771066 i may not have the experience washington likes but i believe i have the experience america needs right now
2771067 hope and change are not just the rhetoric of a campaign for me
2771068 the problem is the system in washington isnt working for us and it hasnt been for a very long time
2771069 as bad as this administration has been its going to take more than just a change in parties to truly turn this country around
2771070 instead of encouraging people to drop private coverage in favor of government plans we should work to make basic private health insurance affordable and accessible for all americans
2771071 taking credit for this troop reduction is like taking credit for the sun coming up in the morning
2771072 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2771073 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2771074 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2771075 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2771076 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2771077 there appears to be no issue that barack obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience
2771078 now that barack obama has changed course and proven his past positions to be just empty words we would like to congratulate him for accepting john mccains principled stand on this critical national security issue if he had visited iraq sooner or actually had a one on one meeting with general petraeus he would have changed his position long ago
2771079 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2771080 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2771081 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2771082 i was scared but i tried to focus on the fact that whatever was happening to me was nothing compared to what some of my tibetan friends had been through
2771083 the officers were firm but courteous and actually quite sympathetic as we had damaged nothing and hurt no one
2771084 men are more rational in their shopping habits than women
2771085 the offender was allegedly making unwanted advances to a female in the bar when another person stepped in
2771086 a bit of a scuffle ensued and the offender spilled out the doorway into the arms of a waiting constable
2771087 he was highly intoxicated and thought we were being racist when we tried to arrest him
2771088 her friend was taking pictures of her while she was doing the business
2771089 the complete columbia recordings 1955 1961 and the first authorized release of two extended live performances
2771090 did i push you too hard when you were at school
2771091 its not my fault i didnt ask to be born
2771092 the police came this week to a nunnery near my home town and took between 15 and 20 nuns away in their nightclothes
2771093 they hope to intimidate us into not taking part in public demonstrations
2771094 this is nothing new we are aware that our activities are monitored but its even more worrying now as we know so many of our relatives and friends are already in very bad situations with no food supply or trapped in their homes
2771095 i have seen first hand what happens to people there who demonstrate like that those monks were brave because they knew that by speaking out they were probably signing their own death warrant
2771096 officials in china have violated the basic spirit of the event and reneged on every promise they made to the international olympic committee about their willingness to accommodate the world
2771097 the party beijing is preparing to throw bears no resemblance to any recent olympics shootings beatings jailings buggings environmental crimes and paramilitary police flooding the streets
2771098 the chinese government promised to respect human rights yet the violent repression in tibet seriously questions this commitment given to the olympic movement
2771099 before tibetans are viewed as a relic and perhaps bothersome minority in their homeland similar to the condition of native americans in the united states formosans in taiwan or serbs in kosovo
2771100 i am legitimately frightened by the venomous rhetoric that the chinese government hurls at the dalai lama
2771101 chinese brothers and sisters wherever you may be with deep concern i appeal to you to help dispel the misunderstandings between our two communities moreover i appeal to you to help us find a peaceful lasting solution to the problem of tibet through dialogue in the spirit of understanding and accommodation
2771102 the promise of the present moment has been precipitated first by the innovative leaders of china gingerly stepping out into the glare of world publicity and opinion by hosting the olympic games and second just now by the brave people of tibet stepping out on their own past the plans of their leader and against great odds standing up for the truth of their existence as tibetans risking their very lives they protest the total destruction of their culture environment and way of life
2771103 i saw them treating a tibetan monk the same way he just kept saying to them i wish you well but they wouldnt back off they were screaming insults at him
2771104 they punched me in the stomach until i managed to run away
2771105 they are preying on people who are on their own theyre just bullies
2771106 about 30 of them surounded me and ripped my flag from me and then kicked and punched me
2771107 i just smiled at them and this seemed to make them more furious
2771108 people there who have relatives overseas are being scrutinised and questioned sometimes arrested
2771109 just one phone call could mean serious trouble for them
2771110 the tibetan issue must be solved between tibetan people and their chinese brothers and sisters
2771111 the time has come to set up friendship between han chinese brothers and sisters and tibetans here in australia i think it would be really worthwhile usually it is lack of communication remaining distant then when something happens official media can create some picture that we are anti chinese
2771112 not to allow the dalai to engage in separatist activities on australian territory
2771113 the implication of a totalitarian states political and ethnic machinations beyond its geographical boundaries is a phenomenon that no western government can afford to ignore
2771114 if hostilities were to one day arise between the west and china after the manner of the cold war
2771115 we should wake up to the fact that china presents an imminent clear and present danger
2771116 its not an exaggeration to say that they want world domination and while they have as much right as any other country to be a superpower that power wielded by a dictatorship to suppress human rights and religious freedoms is a major worry
2771117 by freeing tibet you liberate china too the tibet issue is almost negligable really we understand impermanence we accept that perhaps we are facing our demise but this is bigger than us the rest of the world can use tibet to urge china to change its ways before its too late thats the greater issue here and there is still time to solve it now before china becomes so powerful that it doesnt need to listen any more
2771118 tell people to believe us tell them to help us tell them this could be our last chance
2771119 there was a large crowd of tibetans all around the potala palace
2771120 they were instructed to report to the potala square at 10pm the night before given raincoats and ordered not to move anywhere
2771121 and the cameras didnt show the masses of armed soldiers surrounding them they were everywhere outnumbering the civilians in the trees on the grass
2771122 flagrant human rights abuses continue in china and the appalling re education through labour system appears to be flourishing in the run up to the 2008 olympic games this is contrary to the olympic charter ideal and clearly negates the preservation of human dignity that beijing as an olympic host has committed to uphold
2771123 recently the intimidation and the massive police and army presence at gatherings of tibetans just became unbearable
2771124 i believe this was done to push us to breaking point and to therefore allow them to come down hard on tibetans
2771125 i called a friends mother who lives in central lhasa
2771126 house to house searches are going on if there is a monk or nun in the house they are taken away no questions computers are also being taken away and the police are checking everyones telephone bills to see if they have made many calls overseas
2771127 as all we can see is truckloads of army going in there we are so frightened there will be a lot of deaths tibet is locked down it is virtually a prison now this could be the time they take the opportunity to really crack down and it could be the end of tibet and tibetans
2771128 my biggest fear is that in a week when no one is watching any more the backlash for tibetans will be terrible that is when we will need to speak for them
2771129 if the free world stood up to china they would have to listen and find a peaceful way to solve this crisis
2771130 if you believe in truth please speak up for us
2771131 and yes i have been in tibet recently several times in the last three years
2771132 imagine if your country your home town your family and friends were out of bounds because a foreign power had invaded australia and now the only people welcome there were those who agreed to cast off their australian identity and culture and embrace those of the occupying power
2771133 this week as increasingly disturbing images of the chinese crackdown on tibetan protesters filled our screens i watched with growing outrage and sorrow if you believe in freedom democracy and justice how could you not
2771134 if tibet was a part of china for the last 1000 years why was it necessary to invade it in 1950
2771135 many chinese people i have met have been good people but they are the ones who left the country
2771136 if china had nothing to hide they would never have banned the western media from entering the area
2771137 why do chinese authorities pretend tibet wants independence when it has been made quite clear their simply want autonomy and a say in their own future
2771138 why do the chinese deny tibetans freedom of movement a basic human right
2771139 the olympics gave china the chance to join the rest of the world in the 21st century they have broken that bond and should be exiled into the dark ages where they belong
2771140 many chinese people i have met have been good people but they are the ones who left the country
2771141 overseas students in australia we have a responsibility to go defend our sacred torch we cant let our sacred torch be put out on australian soil
2771142 hm prison camps totalitarian dictatorship anti democracy suppression of basic human rights torture cruelty and now rampant nationalism rearing up and showing its unpleasant face to the world whats not to love
2771143 the road to democracy is not a highway it takes time patience understanding and tolerance the torch relay as always has become a focus for extremists to vent their causes the majority as always remain silent the games itself will make many westerners sit up and take notice as to how westernised china has become in the last 2 decades in another few years we ll wonder what all the fuss is about let the game begin
2771144 but i strongly object the vilification of the chinese people and the idea of an independent tibetan state
2771145 they didnt care much about the game itself they were lured by the prospect of tribal violence they were young and stupid too and they did damage to the sport that will never completely be mended
2771146 many if not most men in the community have been arrested at some point in their lives
2771147 you have to take a ferry you miss the ferry you sleep on the lab floor
2771148 and so these people are going to want to come to a place where theyre going to have a real community where there are things to do and theyre going to be excited about being in town and with other scientists
2771149 weve got enough other guys to look at in preseason even without them
2771150 i kept promising that wed take a shot i wanted to keep the clock running and didnt want to interrupt the running game while they were in rhythm
2771151 thats part of his responsibility especially in the red zone i dont know how much thatll be our defensive backfield cast but its an option
2771152 i just though it was a really good play and our guys executed it well
2771153 it wasnt the throw but the decision to throw that was the problem
2771154 frost did a wonderful job he was very specific putting the ball inside the 20
2771155 i know the teachers are running 30 days without a contract
2771156 federal officials executed a search warrant at the companys corporate office in dallas
2771157 they have not been here for long and they just kept themselves to themselves
2771158 siga por este camino derecho hasta que llegue a un lugar en donde est n todas las curvas desordenadas ah doble a la derecha pero cierren las ventanas
2771159 lo pas bien pero estoy feliz de dejar de verte
2771160 one of the essences of the finger lakes is that it is never the same year to year
2771161 the iron willed should cellar it for five years or more the weak will fall for its seductive charms tonight
2771162 if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters the same
2771163 if a stick of length x is broken into three pieces what is the probability that the three pieces can be used to construct a triangle
2771164 my favorite word is family because they love each other and sometimes families have hot tempers and they fight a lot and sometimes they have cold tempers i have a hot temper sometimes and sometimes i have a good temper or a cold temper thats what family means to me i have those three kinds of tempers thats all i told about families
2771165 nuestra relaci n es constructiva es importante y tambi n muy sencilla
2771166 bush dijo al presidente hu que este es un importante aspecto del di logo entre estados unidos y china y que los chinos pueden confiar en que el futuro presidente estadounidense tambi n har de esto un tema importante de di logo
2771167 suddenly all the heavy machinery in the place was flying around
2771168 on the occasion of his annual birthday celebration interview by the press on july 10 1935 in his suite at the hotel new yorker tesla announced a method of transmitting mechanical energy accurately with minimal loss over any terrestrial distance including a related new means of communication and a method he claimed which would facilitate the unerring location of underground mineral deposits
2771169 using biogas decreases greenhouse gas emissions produces renewable energy and safeguards local air and water quality the epa is pleased to see the st anthony dairy digester come on line its good for the environment and the farmers
2771170 he grabbed me by my arm and put my arm behind my back and pulled it up until it hurt
2771171 the security guards who wronged her i want them to be held accountable for their actions
2771172 her story indeed is stranger than fiction and its only the beginning the first glimpse of a new and uncertain factor in human affairs opening up unimagined physical possibilities but also threatening our very survival
2771173 because of the difficult situation the security forces opened fire to disperse the crowd using just a little force against the violent protesters because they opened fire the protesters dispersed
2771174 birth after birth i desire to serve the lotus feet of the acaryas and live in a society of devotees
2771175 method and apparatus for altering a region in the earths atmosphere ionosphere and or magnetosphere
2771176 haarp in gakona about 300 miles south of here thats a fake decoy for the public everyone knows about that
2771177 they even have a web site with one of those instant cam things and a few dozen antennae thats just a thing for show so they can say that its all harmless and open
2771178 bumped the power up to the max and let it blow
2771179 they never used that much power before so they just did it to see what would happen
2771180 and when they did it kind of multiplied the power and then a huge chunk of earths atmosphere blew away out into space
2771181 here look at the ultraviolet and radiation the came through right after they did it they blew away the shield and all the radiation just came right down and zapped earth and look it lasted for a long time
2771182 shit yes here in alaska there were eskimos that were all fried and like whole herds of antelopes but the holes also moved west and did their real harm in siberia but it isnt just the people it killed it made these people and animals sick from the radiation that came from the sun the stuff thats usually blocked by the atmosphere and so there have been still births and cancers and mutations they are trying to keep it all real hushed its insane and the worst part is that they are going to use it again
2771183 you can still see the marks it left on houses
2771184 small group of american physicists some of whom have aired complaints in scientific journals fear haarp may not simply be the simple research experiment that advocates describe but possibly phase one of a secret u s military program that could be seeking ways to blow other countries spacecraft out of the sky or disrupt communications over large portions of the planet
2771185 beam much more energy into the ionosphere that could produce a severe disruption of the upper atmosphere at one location that may produce effects that spread rapidly around the earth for years
2771186 there are very clear statements by the u s air force to the effect that weather modification technology is available haarp is fully operational and could be used in actually military situations it is clear that weather warfare does constitute an instrument of the air force they even identify the scenarios of its use
2771187 we have protected up to 17 nights in one vineyard
2771188 and all of a sudden its just cold and wet and treacherous
2771189 we came to the olympics with high hopes and expectations
2771190 i believe we were able to achieve this medal because of the people around us who helped us
2771191 i definitely have to say it is an honor to be the lead
2771192 but we are just four races into this and its a long regatta were not even halfway
2771193 air force standards are very exacting when it comes to munitions handling
2771194 the weapons were always in our custody and there was never a danger to the american public
2771195 the main risk would have been the way the air force responded to any problems with the flight because they would have handled it much differently if they would have known nuclear warheads were onboard
2771196 the air force takes its mission to safeguard weapons seriously
2771197 no effort will be spared to ensure that the matter is thoroughly and completely investigated
2771198 i dont know why i said to bob bowman i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i couldnt stop crying
2771199 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 seeing everybody so close together
2771200 its usually not how it is after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point coming home in the freestyle its all adrenaline
2771201 anytime you think you can get close to michael phelps he jumps to another level
2771202 i went out too fast i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2771203 if i had gone a couple of tenths slower on the backstroke i would have had a better shot i did my best i cant ask for anything else
2771204 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would going into the ready room i started getting these chills up my body
2771205 right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i was pretty emotional after that race
2771206 a pair of tu 95ms planes flew along a large range along the coasts of alaska and canada and returned home via the north pole the bombers were refueled in mid air by an il 78 tanker aircraft the average flight duration made up some 17 hours the aircraft flew more than 13 000 kilometers
2771207 during refueling each tu 95ms took on board 30 tonnes of fuel a record high amount since the soviet era
2771208 another pair of tu 95ms flew around greenland into the air space over eastern atlantic ocean the average duration of flight was some 12 hours
2771209 tu 95ms flights were made in accordance with air patrol plans during the mission the bombers were accompanied by nato planes
2771210 the crews of tu 22m3 planes along with the scheduled flights flew patrol missions over the black sea with the average flight time of 5 hours another two pairs of tju 22m3 planes practiced bombing at the nagotai range in the irkutsk region tu 95 ms tu 22m3 and il 78 made more than 15 flights today
2771211 the flights by long range aviation were made according to international rules of the use of air space over neutral waters without violating the borders of other states
2771212 the far eastern air force and air defense formation has detailed more than 90 su 24 su 25 su 27 and mi 8 helicopters to the drill pilots will be flying in the area of airfields and along routes drill missions to deliver strikes at ground targets and the tactics of providing air cover for troops
2771213 dai de gra a o que de gra a recebestes
2771214 o verdadeiro homem de bem o que cumpre a lei de justi a de amor e de caridade na sua maior pureza
2771215 where do i put my finger there ok nothings happening is it on
2771216 i have been in front of the full sized system and believe me you just run you dont have time to think about it you just run
2771217 in iraq there was a situation when combatants had taken media as human shields the battalion commander told me there was no way of separating combatants from non combatants without lethal force
2771218 it is ethically dubious to say they are useful for crowd control when they will obviously be used by unscrupulous people for torture
2771219 you go to hell but you must pay the tax and we divide the tax amongst ourself
2771220 with a fire like this it makes its own wind
2771221 im intensely listening to the radio to decide whether or not to leave it all depends on the wind
2771222 during the last fire they evacuated my family to the apple valley high school where we spent five days i dont want to go through that again
2771223 no matter what we take if we have to go you always leave something behind
2771224 we are all engaged in service of some sort the highest service is to the supreme lord
2771225 god is the father of all living beings in thousands of different forms
2771226 human life is a stage of perfection in evolution if we miss the message back we go through the process again
2771227 after this life there is a still better life on other planets
2771228 we have to adjust to these things currents come and go in life just as in an ocean
2771229 i dont think theyre authorized to do what theyre doing and i view it as a gross violation of law enforcement protocol
2771230 it was like a telemarketer that you couldnt hang up on
2771231 it was a voluntary survey nobody approached them there were signs saying that a survey was taking place nobody waved them down
2771232 if we dont do that the criticism will come out that we had so many who were refusers
2771233 we had a 10 year old in the back whos tired we tell them thanks but no thanks we have to get this child back home to bed
2771234 we say no thank you we have to get our child home
2771235 at this point both clones start chortling at us and ridiculing us
2771236 the very act of pulling a motorist over subjects him her and their vehicle at very least to a visual search this means if the motorist was pulled over without suspicion of violating a law than sic they have been subjected to an unlawful search
2771237 for the record the proper response to any such incursion into privacy is to ask the question am i under arrest if the answer is no ask if you are free to go if you are told no demand to be arrested or you will leave and then leave
2771238 whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice o descendant of bharata and a predominant rise of irreligion at that time i appear myself
2771239 test results of the new airborne weapon have shown that its efficiency and power is commensurate with a nuclear weapon
2771240 you will now see it in action the bomb which has no match in the world is being tested at a military site
2771241 the defence ministry stresses this military invention does not contradict a single international treaty russia is not unleashing a new arms race
2771242 the main destruction is inflicted by an ultrasonic shockwave and an incredibly high temperature
2771243 at the same time i want to stress that the action of this weapon does not contaminate the environment in contrast to a nuclear one
2771244 the united nation is the assembly of some dogs they are barking
2771245 he said just wait till they open the door then shoot
2771246 when i opened the door there was just women and kids two adults were lying down on the bed and there were three children on the bed two more were behind the bed
2771247 i looked at them for a few seconds just enough to know they were not presenting a threat they looked scared
2771248 i told him there were women and kids inside there
2771249 i said but theyre just women and children he didnt say nothing
2771250 this is completely unethical inappropriate and has no basis in fact
2771251 has been designed exclusively for launch from a variety of pakistans air platforms providing these with a strategic stand off capability on land and at sea
2771252 the raad can carry all types of warheads and has an accuracy comparable to pakistans longer babur cruise missile
2771253 consistency by the politician is the qualification of an ass
2771254 you want independence you will have independence but you will remain perpetually in war
2771255 the blasts took place almost simultaneously and we are still counting the number of dead
2771256 we are asking relatives to identify the bodies when all parts are put together
2771257 definitely some terrorist organization is behind these attacks which wants to weaken our unity and peaceful co existence
2771258 i saw chairs flying in the air along with bodies
2771259 while we were on the right side there was firefighters getting ready they were bussing them back and forth and a couple of vets that were there they got the vibe that something was coming down
2771260 we started asking questions everybody started asking questions and the next thing you know there was a red cross representative pacing back and forth in front of the crowd holding his hand over the radio i couldnt hear what it was saying but it was like pulsed whatever the speech was on there it was pulsed and that means to me most likely it was a countdown
2771261 but he took his hand off at the last three seconds and he gave this heartfelt look like just run for your life because he didnt want to bring it on his conscience he didnt want to go to his grave with that and then we had a couple of seconds to put our heads together
2771262 if you dont spare your money i shall kill you
2771263 the beginning of a movement and the beginning of an industry
2771264 how a relatively ragtag insurgency has managed to keep the worlds most powerful armies at bay
2771265 we went to afghanistan for the purpose of capturing osama bin laden and disbanding the taliban that was providing him with a base
2771266 this discussion seems to be premised on an assumption that our effort in afghanistan has morphed into a war on afghanistan
2771267 we are discussing a country with people that are terrorized by groups of extremists it is our job as one of the strongest powers to help them and show them a way out of the living in fear and in poverty
2771268 how can you nation build destroy poppie sic growing and defeat the taliban without troops when we know they terrorize the citizens and have no qualms about killing people
2771269 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
2771270 a year when democratic politicians stopped aping republicans on national security and started talking about reframing the debate
2771271 the u s invasion of afghanistan was as illegal as the invasion of iraq
2771272 the invasion of afghanistan was not legitimate self defense under the u n charter because the attacks on sept 11 were criminal attacks not armed attacks by another country afghanistan did not attack the united states
2771273 the conflict in afghanistan will be far more costly and much much longer than americans realize

2771510 mr as you know your situation is a little complicated by your heart and your diabetes and that means were going to modify treatment in some way i didnt fully understand
2771511 you are not mr of city state born on birthdate
2771512 no you moron im not and you just revealed a bunch more private information by asking me that
2771513 do i look sixty some years old and is there a reason i would lie about my identity
2771514 well i am on nadolol so that would explain the low blood pressure
2771515 we just need to keep fighting and see if we can come out of it the plan is to come out tomorrow and be the best we can be we were scoring runs in bunches but now its not happening but were not panicking
2771516 the kind of offensive production we got from the top of the lineup is going to go a long way for you
2771517 i just went out there and tried to focus on the mitt as much as possible and keep my mind down in the zone i came in here knowing that they were probably going to take pitches on me because im a rookie coming into a big stadium so i really tried to pound the zone
2771518 thats the best ive seen him throw since he got up here
2771519 as the game went on he got a little swagger going he commanded all his pitches it was a huge game for his confidence
2771520 were running out of games so we need to move on from this point we need to play well
2771521 i expect so much out of myself and thats why im so disappointed tonight
2771522 its my job to make sure i take us deep in the game i take a lot of pride in doing that and its just extremely disappointing when youre not able to do it
2771523 everyone feeds off each other and you put a lot of pressure on the pitchers
2771524 when you look up and down our lineup and everyones clicking youre going to score a lot of runs and we have it all going right now
2771525 coming into this last two months of the year were playing on the road a lot so we have to start playing as well on the road as we have at home
2771526 i kept us in the ballgame i put up a quality start
2771527 ive been at two clubs with paul ince i hope he takes me to his new one but i dont think thats going to happen
2771528 when he came to macclesfield he was a breath of fresh air
2771529 his reputation on the pitch was as an angry man but he was always very calm and made sure he got his point across which was good
2771530 he changed the whole club around and saved us from going out of the league
2771531 macclesfield were down basically everyone had written us off and he ince made it more professional
2771532 the training was good it was always different and high tempo which was how he liked to play football
2771533 a lot of managers in the premier league talk about tempo and thats just his method hes been at manchester united and he will have learned a bit from there
2771534 hes worked with top managers all of his career and he will have taken bits and pieces off all of them and im sure he will be a success at blackburn
2771535 hes still got that winners attitude when he joined in the five a sides he was still going around smashing people but thats just in his make up and i hope he does well
2771536 hes got a tough act to follow mark hughes who did a great job at blackburn but i think hes got what it takes do well
2771537 when he came to macc he kept us up and he won two trophies at mk dons so hes had success wherever hes been
2771538 hes probably not going to go and win the premier league or champions league at blackburn but i think hell do a similar job to hughes
2771539 its a risk but they could have gone with sam allardyce who failed at newcastle so you never know
2771540 it was nice to be successful to be fair even though i couldnt play when we got to wembley because i was cup tied after playing in the oldham game
2771541 just being around the place and getting a medal for winning the league was great but thats all in the past now and im back at accrington now and i want to do well
2771542 i need to get my head right and prove to everybody that i was a good signing and the gaffer was right to bring me in last summer
2771543 we have to do something about our home form the gaffer spoke to us about it at our first meeting when we came back to pre season
2771544 weve certainly got the potential in the team a few lads have gone out and the gaffer has brought a few in and hell be looking for a few more
2771545 teams that have won the conference in the past have gone on and climbed the ladder
2771546 you only have to look at yeovil theyve gone up again
2771547 so theres no reason that at a club of our size this team cant do that
2771548 ive shown that im a good player but i sometimes drift out of games and i dont think my body language helps at times
2771549 but ive got to get out of that and even when im not at my best i can still be effective for the team so hopefully thats something i can work on
2771550 well continue to fight and its going to be interesting now weve got to look up theres one team in front of us
2771551 i keep telling general manager kenny williams we got what we need
2771552 but some people make me look bad some people make me look disappointed some people make me think about what we have some players should look themselves in the mirror and be embarrassed and they should be better thats all i can say
2771553 i feel like i might start pressing a little bit and try to make a pitch better than i need to
2771554 when its so close to your head you dont know whats going on
2771555 if it was intentional i was hoping for the ribs or lower we scored five runs after that whatever it did was a good thing for us
2771556 ive just been relying on my fastball and my curveball pretty much and using my other two pitches every once in a while
2771557 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
2771558 everybody says its fine for a while to get a couple of days off
2771559 but once youve got to come to the field every day being around the guys and not being able to go out there and help it eventually gets to you
2771560 if we want to win we need harang back in the rotation
2771561 we have to set the table for the big guys
2771562 hes thrown the ball very well since weve used him
2771563 if you expect to do something special and play in october you just move on
2771564 were not a power hitting club and weve got to execute
2771565 weve got to do little things but still you need the hits to win ballgames thats the brand of ball weve got to play
2771566 a couple good starts in a row can help you get on a roll
2771567 i think it might be some kind of muscle spasm or something
2771568 i couldnt breathe so well see how it feels tomorrow morning
2771569 hes given us a lot of quality starts without much to show for it
2771570 as one of the best selling cars in america the popularity of the accord can be traced to its combination of refinement quality sporty feel safety equipment fuel efficiency and long term value
2771571 other cars can claim some of those traits too but only the accord reaches consistently higher in more of the areas that matter most
2771572 i dont think he can repeat that the rest of the year but that was vintage
2771573 for me as long as im having good at bats and going up there not making bad outs im ok
2771574 it was kind of like a wasted day at work
2771575 we just have to come back and try to win the series
2771576 somebody with a wireless device in the us should expect it to be compromised while hes there
2771577 its very hard not to get frustrated especially where were at right now
2771578 but weve got to come out every day just try to execute do the little things right and give ourselves a chance to win
2771579 the window of opportunity continues to a close a little bit smaller with each game that passes
2771580 and im not concerned about what anybody else is doing in our division but ourselves
2771581 he wouldnt have been let go if he had performed better
2771582 its a risk on our part but its a good risk were banking on his track record and his experience and not his recent performance
2771583 i threw all right my movement was a little bit off
2771584 anytime you can get to them early thats how you beat those guys
2771585 hes a guy who goes out there every day gives you 100 percent every day and is one of the leaders of this team emotionally and on the field
2771586 these last two games were probably my top two of the year so far
2771587 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2771588 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2771589 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2771590 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2771591 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2771592 we are feeling very very good about where the senator is in the polls and we obviously expect as america the american electorate turns their attentions even more to this race in connection with the conventions we expect to do to do quite well
2771593 i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2771594 so i think on things like that shoot i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads and well just let them do those ads
2771595 senator mccain is running the same old negative karl rove style ads that were all tired of
2771596 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2771597 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2771598 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign
2771599 hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month
2771600 no some of us are efficient some of us are effective and some of us are just effed
2771601 thats coz you just bat ya eyelids at them and melt their heart
2771602 that and the 50 note i slip into their palms as i shake their hands
2771603 wow this really escalated while i wasnt watching like an escalator but not like one youd find in the airport like a flat one but one that you might find in parliament station where you cant see the bottom or top when you get on it now that is trippy shit
2771604 fetisov could have known everything he should have been informed warning of any kind of violation we saw nothing of the kind
2771605 im all right but im disappointed with myself for making such a mistake it was a pretty big impact of all the places to go off the kink is not the place to do it the car did stand up extremely well to the accident it looked like it was going to be close at the finish but unfortunately nothing seems to be going right for us this year
2771606 i had a small problem and had to make a stop to have the crew check out the car
2771607 we came in made some changes and the car was absolutely great when we went back out
2771608 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2771609 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2771610 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2771611 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2771612 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2771613 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2771614 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2771615 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2771618 military confrontation does not serve the interests of the local communities on the contrary it threatens the stability of the entire region
2771619 the aim for france and the european union is via dialogue with the parties involved to secure a ceasefire and then to contribute to a political solution to this conflict
2771620 pierre lannes posted a new blog entry nouvelles pages sur titou
2771621 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2771622 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2771623 people laughed at the way i dressed i didnt look like anyone but in order to be irreplaceable one must always be different
2771624 lindsay knows ralph cheats on her but has no way to prove it she asks her best friend marie to help her out by seducing ralph so she can catch him marie tries to stick to the plan but when ralph showed her his cock she changed her mind that cock was the biggest she had ever seen and she wanted it in her tight little pussy
2771625 hailey and madison have never had a big cock and their friend says her boyfriend has a huge one so they tricked her into bringing him over when the guy arrived they kicked their loser friend out and kept that big cock for themselves this guy destroyed their tight wet teen pussies and made them cum multiple times

2771629 hillary clinton and president clinton are integral parts of our convention in denver
2771630 hillary clinton will be speaking tuesday night in prime time president clinton will be speaking wednesday night their people are not only welcome to this convention we need their help
2771631 weve gone through a bruising primary season between these two excellent candidates and there are some people still healing from that i understand it
2771632 but in the end i believe that the hillary clinton supporters and hillary herself are definitely committed to obamas candidacy
2771633 last year a customer who left with 8 000 euros 12 200 dollars worth of purchases it was a basic sale this summer when we sell 3 000 or 4 000 euros 4 600 or 6 130 dollars worth were happy
2771634 we have made fewer sales but for sums that were often very considerable one customer left with items worth more than 50 000 euros 76 600 dollars
2771635 yachts of more than 40 metres 130 feet belonging to the super rich are still there but with the 15 to 35 metre 49 to 115 feet yachts there is a very big drop in numbers
2771636 we are easily at a third of last years business there are far fewer people coming to saint tropez just to anchor for the evening
2771637 this summer an average of 30 boats are anchored compared to some 60 in previous years
2771638 i have never seen this before our clients came here for a total break this year they are at their computers from 8 00 am

2771645 small businesses are critical to our economys health and we should be giving them every possible opportunity to thrive
2771646 complex and burdensome regulations mire small firms in costly and time intensive paperwork holding them back from achieving their highest potential
2771647 when given the opportunity small firms can bolster our economy but these regulations are costing them their valuable capital and time
2771648 clearly more needs to be done to ensure that regulations do not unfairly burden small firms
2771649 with an economy in distress from high energy prices high unemployment and a troubled financial market we must do all that we can to promote a strong small business sector
2771650 by breaking down unnecessary obstacles so small ventures can spend more time expanding their businesses and less time and money complying with free our small businesses to help renew our nations economic prosperity

2771670 when john mccain and his surrogates call obama a celebrity theyre not insulting obama theyre insulting obamas supporters
2771671 i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest i heard the bullets hitting the chassis
2771672 my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was turned to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire
2771673 i got out this morning a friend found me and brought me out on the back of his motorbike i was already waiting for death in my basement the city is in ruins there are bodies lying in the street
2771674 all i have left is the clothes im standing in and these two bags my house was wooden it was turned to splinters by the shells i climbed out of the ruins i dont know where i will go i dont know what to do
2771675 i saw our house in flames as we ran theres nothing left for us to go back to our lives are ruined
2771676 people have no water no electricity no gas and no food
2771677 my relatives told me georgian soldiers burnt to death a family of seven people in their apartment an 18 year old boy who climbed out into the street for a few moments was shot dead by a sniper
2771678 ossetian patriots first let us cleanse our markets of georgian spies then forward to liberate the homeland
2771679 we are sending men who have done military service so teenage lads dont go to die
2771680 in tskhinvali you cant find one brick standing on top of another the city is still disputed there are georgian strong points on the hills surrounding it im going back to fight tonight ive got my own team of guys
2771681 my cousin came from dmenis village last night he got two bullets in the back were going to go there and slaughter the georgians like the fascist pigs they are if the russians let us well smash them all the way to tbilisi we are a warrior race we know how to fight
2771682 the georgians hit our positions with grad missiles they surrounded us but we managed to break out if im needed ill be heading back
2771683 a 78 year old woman with an infant under each arm was crushed by a tank
2771684 a lot of volunteers are getting held up in the north of the republic but we wanted to get straight to the action
2771685 the fundraising event was organised by 40 volunteers mentored by heartware network and if it wasnt already shocking to find that volunteers started streaming in to work from 6am in the morning for the noon event its shocking albeit heartwarming to find out that they started planning this since 2007 and put in an estimated 8 000 over hours
2771686 an attack on the secretariat is an attack on the institution
2771687 the time has come for us all to show our responsibility and to end a deteriorating process
2771688 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2771689 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at his as half empty or half full
2771690 when i scored that goal we went and picked it up
2771691 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2771692 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands
2771693 if you look at the replay it goes right under the wall
2771694 unfortunately we were the better team for 70 minutes we let two points get away from us
2771695 after tonight well put this behind us well go to beijing looking for a win you dont go into these games looking for a draw or looking to score x amount of goals were completely confident
2771696 disregarding our threat will be putting the expatriate staff nationwide including the two currently being held hostage at risk for which the management of julius berger should be held liable
2771697 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2771698 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2771699 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect

2771720 russland will georgien demoralisieren und endlich saakaschwili endlich abl sen
2771721 alle beobachter in tiflis aber auch in der un waren sicher dass der august ein hei er monat werden w rde
2771722 unter meinen verwandten sind osseten wir haben nebeneinander gewohnt wir haben gefeiert geheiratet und jetzt weinen wir gemeinsam
2771723 wir hassen die russen nicht wir bewundern sie ein gro es volk
2771724 und wir wollen uns nicht vorstellen dass sie uns hassen
2771725 wenn mich die stadt winterberg einladen w rde mit angela merkel oder franz m ntefering zu wandern w re ich auch sofort dabei
2771726 und bei oskar lafontaine h tte ich vorher einen trinken m ssen
2771727 nein wir wollen hier ber wichtige und langfristige themen wie die globalisierung diskutieren
2771728 wir verstehen uns nicht nur beim wandern sondern auch politisch und pers nlich
2771729 wir haben in deutschland alle chancen aber wir werden diese chancen nicht im schlafwagen nutzen k nnen
2771730 wer fr her f r 600 oder 1000 euro am tag ein studio mietete kauft sich heute lieber ein mikrophon
2771731 es werden heute verdammt viele gute aufnahmen zu hause gemacht
2771732 daf r brauchst du keine klimatisierten 400 quadratmeter mit konzertfl gel entscheidend ist immer noch was vor dem mikrophon passiert also was gemeint ist
2771733 es gibt keine dumpingmentalit t wir zahlen immer noch zwischen 40 000 bis 100 000 euro f r eine albumproduktion einer vielversprechenden newcomerband
2771734 es gibt durchaus acts die einen hohen vorschuss bekommen aber die musik relativ g nstig produzieren k nnen
2771735 der markt f r retro studiotechnik ist momentan so gut wie leergekauft
2771736 als ob es auf dem weg ber italien und griechenland nichts zu essen gibt
2771737 es gibt noch andere zuschauer die wir nicht ber cksichtigen hotelg ste zum beispiel bewohner von alten und studentenwohnheimen
2771738 wir wissen doch aus untersuchungen von ard und zdf dass viele t rken mittlerweile sehr wohl deutsche medien konsumieren
2771739 aber wenn die integration nicht gelingt wird das auch teuer
2771740 unsere st rke ist dass unsere daten von niemandem bestritten werden
2771741 stellen sie sich vor sie klingeln an einer wohnungst r es macht jemand auf und sie verstehen kein wort
2771742 da sitzt ja vom vater der arbeiter ist ber die analphabetische oma bis zur tochter die vielleicht gerade das jura examen macht alles zusammen auf dem sofa
2771743 letztlich ist es keine wirtschaftliche sondern eine politische entscheidung ob man den schon lange hier lebenden ausl ndern das gef hl geben will ein teil der gesellschaft zu sein
2771744 man kann nicht ernsthaft vertreten dass die gruppe der ausl nder auf dauer in der fernsehforschung nicht abgebildet wird
2771745 wir sehen die methodischen probleme wir sehen aber auch eine politische notwendigkeit diese zuschauergruppen ernst zu nehmen
2771746 6000 russische soldaten sind ber nacht ber den roki tunnel nach georgien eingedrungen 90 panzer 150 gepanzerte truppentransporter 250 artilleriegesch tze
2771747 4000 russische soldaten landen am hafen von oschamschira in abchasien sie kommen vom schwarzmeerhafen sewastopol
2771748 wir werden sie bezahlen lassen wir werden f r gerechtigkeit sorgen
2771749 der russische au enminister sergej lawrow hat vor hohen diplomatischen vertretern ge u ert man wolle georgien ausl schen
2771750 thank you very much i am totally insane thank you i am not insane because i was born insane the world makes me insane
2771751 all religious services are provided by professionals recommended by chinas religious associations
2771752 criticism of china on religion from the west is totally out of place
2771753 if china was to open up like the west wants it would be mass chaos
2771754 tendr amos que ver con expertos y verlo en la comisi n de justicia c mo se puede aplicar o modificar la ley para que un terrorista est alejado de cualquier victima del terrorismo aunque no sea una v ctima propiciada por un acto terrorista suyo en estos momentos es prematuro
2771755 respecto a delitos que ya han sido juzgados condenados y por los que ya se ha cumplido condena
2771756 esa es la intenci n de todos sobre todo a la vista de los ltimos casos que hemos conocido es evidente que corre prisa abordar determinado tipo de medidas y de reformas
2771757 la audiencia nacional ha dictado una serie de normas en base a la legislaci n actualmente vigente naturalmente si la legislaci n cambia tambi n las pr cticas tienen que cambiar
2771758 lo importante es que el pp ha rectificado respecto a su actitud de toda la legislatura pasada y que esa rectificaci n es muy buena para todos porque se ha llegado a un entendimiento fundamental en la lucha antiterrorista entre los dos grandes partidos
2771759 una actitud de mayor di logo siempre es buena en euskadi
2771760 va a ser bueno para la pol tica vasca en general que haya una actitud de mayor di logo y con intenci n de entendimiento por parte de la nueva direcci n del pp de euskadi
2771761 de ganar las elecciones y por lo tanto de gobernar en euskadi
2771762 en un segundo momento habr que ver c mo se hace eso
2771763 los resultados de las ltimas elecciones generales demuestran que el pse es un partido en alza
2771764 con total normalidad y sin necesidad de que seamos los partidos pol ticos los que instemos a la actuaci n
2771765 la fiscal a tendr que actuar naturalmente pero corresponde a la fiscal a decidir en qu momento
2771766 no tenemos que ser los partidos los que estemos vigilantes de esa situaci n sino que el estado de derecho tiene mecanismos suficientes para hacer esa vigilancia
2771767 son los juzgados y tribunales la administraci n penitenciaria los que tiene que vigilar la aplicaci n de este tipo de medidas y estoy seguro de que se va a actuar con absoluta normalidad
2771768 precisas al tratar a personas que han cometido unos delitos tan repugnantes como los de terrorismo
2771769 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
2771770 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
2771771 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
2771772 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
2771773 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
2771774 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
2771775 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
2771776 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
2771777 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
2771778 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
2771779 theres just a handful of us left but it has become easier for us domestic folks to compete
2771780 this is not just about steel but also maple syrup and avocados and blueberries at the grocery store
2771781 avocado salad in minneapolis in january is just not going to work in this new world because flying it in is going to make it cost as much as a rib eye
2771782 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
2771783 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
2771784 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
2771785 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production
2771786 cuando hay dificultades es bueno volver a la constituci n
2771787 siempre ser gu a fundamental en la vida pol tica y democr tica
2771788 la mejor gu a de montaje de las piezas del scalextric de la espa a plural y garant a de igualdad de oportunidades
2771789 todos los espa oles sean ciudadanos de primera e iguales
2771790 galicia y andaluc a aportan cerebros brazos y trabajo para la espa a de las autonom as junto con los dem s pueblos de espa a
2771791 el gobierno ha movido pieza y lo ha hecho en una buena direcci n en funci n de lo que dice el estatuto de andaluc a y el de catalu a
2771792 lo que no podemos hacer bajo ning n concepto es avanzar por una senda que rompa la igualdad de todos los espa oles
2771793 los impuestos son para recabar entre los m s ricos y realizar un ejercicio corrector con los m s pobres
2771794 tras imponer el estatuto de catalu a que no es constitucional se dedique ahora a incumplirlo
2771795 if its to easy to get it will easy to leave
2771796 not lock people up or use scarce federal resources to arrest people for using or possessing marijuana
2771797 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
2771798 the personal use of marijuana by responsible adults act of 2008
2771799 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement involvement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest and jail responsible alcohol drinkers this should be our policy with marijuana as well
2771800 the federal governments misguided prohibition of marijuana is a war on young people
2771801 because of this failed public policy we have alienated an entire generation to believe that the police and the federal government are instruments of their oppression rather than their protection
2771802 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2771803 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough
2771804 hes f cking awesome at this point id have to say no
2771805 we just have to make sure its the right guy
2771806 karmically we deserve the right guy its a tough thing man we make a pretty big noise
2771807 we wouldnt know how to do an audition we wouldnt have somebody come in and go okay play
2771808 we have a bunch of stuff finished its great its killer
2771809 we started getting really productive when a ton of drama started happening on the road it was like our safe place to go to sometimes thats how you get some feelings out
2771810 slash said he heard a couple of tunes i wish axl rose all the best
2771811 i will be shooting material at you rapid fire and with a variety of topics that have consumed me to the very core all this summer
2771812 i try not to interact with the modern world too much at all shopping in supermarkets is an ordeal and i only recently realised that tony blair is no longer prime minister as i dont read newspapers they are just too distressing
2771813 i wouldnt dream of leaving the house without gloves and a hat when we go out we do attract a lot of attention and some people laugh but i think that is their problem
2771814 martin and i spend hours sourcing clothes from the 1930s and i am always dressed in period costume i usually spend around 50 to 150 per item i buy them from the internet and vintage clothing specialists and i have wardrobes full of wonderful old clothes and items such as cloche hats and mary jane shoes with t bar straps
2771815 some of the patients in the sonoma state study were put through painful procedures like the pneumoencelphalogram in which air is injected into the brain before a series of x rays imagine puncturing someones spinal cord drawing fluid out and putting a foreign substance in there gas when they trap air in your body youre in pain excruciating pain for days
2771816 need to charge low bat i was like what the
2771817 will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2771818 gt more information on touch diamond and raphael for both sprint and verizon
2771819 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2771820 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2771821 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2771822 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2771823 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2771824 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2771825 im going to just try to stay patient to relax
2771826 ill try to stay off my feet for a couple of hours
2771827 die israelis sollten stolz sein dass die georgischen soldaten eine israelische ausbildung genossen haben und heute ganz toll k mpfen
2771828 angesichts der spannungen zwischen moskau und tiblisi wurde uns klar dass allzu viele israelische waffensysteme bei den georgiern auf die russen wie das rote tuch beim stierkampf wirken
2771829 israel ist der gr te investor in georgien in allen bereichen
2771830 in russland verhielt man sich immer mit gro em respekt zum georgischen volk man h lt es f r ein brudervolk so bleibt es auch k nftig trotz der verbrecherischen politik der heutigen georgischen staatsf hrung diese wird das georgische volk nach einiger zeit selbst objektiv bewerten

2771850 die amerikaner glauben pakistan sei ein mittel stliches arabisches land wir sind aber ein s dasiatisches muslimisches land mit einer langen tradition von rechtsstaatlichkeit und demokratie selbst unsere milit rregierungen mussten sich immer vor der justiz legitimieren es ist eine trag die dass washington dies nicht versteht

2771854 more apples are showing up on teachers desks and in classrooms
2771855 the cupertino calif computer maker has been aggressively working to reclaim its former ranking as the top supplier of pcs to schools and colleges
2771856 apple lost the education pc sales crown to dell in 1999 according to market research firm idc but in the first quarter this year apple leapfrogged dell in sales of notebook pcs to the u s education market which includes k 12 colleges universities and trade schools it was no 1 with market share of 36 5 while dell slipped to second with 27 1 idc plans to release second quarter data tuesday
2771857 those education market figures dont include apples sales to students in the consumer market where it is even stronger apple like other computer vendors is in the thick of the back to school selling season
2771858 what weve seen over the last couple of years is a significant increase in the number of students who own an apple laptop or apple desktop or plan to buy one said eric weil managing partner of student monitor a market research firm that tracks spending by college students in a spring survey of college students planning to buy notebook pcs this year 43 said they were looking to get apple laptops it was far and away the no 1 brand with almost twice the response rate of no 2 vendor dell which got 22
2771859 apples resurgent mac business is beginning to chip away at the market share of rivals who sell machines running microsofts windows operating system
2771860 the question apple faces now is whether to lower prices to go after even more market share
2771861 apple is widely expected to unveil a new line of notebook computers likely with lower prices in the coming weeks from an overall market perspective there are a ton of windows pc vendors that are quaking in their boots over if apple decides to lower its prices idc analyst richard shim said

2771865 thank you for writing your newsletter some good news i enjoyed reading the positive stories i am heartened by thegoodness and generosity that i see in people keep up your good work
2771866 when the war in iraq started i went into a depression state i feltconstantly worried and agitated and it was hard to enjoy doing things iloved to do then i found your site it lifted my spirits and helped get me out ofthe funk i was in now im going to school and enjoying the things ilike to do whenever i feel depressed i visit your site

2771871 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2771872 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2771873 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2771874 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2771875 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2771876 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2771877 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2771878 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2771879 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about
2771880 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2771881 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2771882 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2771883 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2771884 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2771885 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2771886 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2771887 go to each of your vendors every 6 9 months and ask for 10 30 off if half of them say yes youll save 5 15 on fixed costs people will give you a discount if they think they are going to lose the business

2771891 no man in history including jesus christ has directly revealed to the world the satanic weapon used to enslave mankind intellectual thought
2771892 they thought i was fair game i was an instrument of purpose to achieve their desires and not 100 percent real and also that they had me by the short curlies because i thought that the world revolved around them and therefore i think that i am fair game and rightly so if they want to play dirty i get to too its not a one way street i will use the physcial strength that i have over them my superior 4

2771899 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
2771900 when i told abbie hoffman that he was the first one who made me laugh
2771901 a demonstration should turn you on not turn you off
2771902 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all

2771906 my own opinion even speaking as a woman is that no more female input should be allowed in establishing and enforcing the rules and regulations of a men group if this is to be a haven for men to discuss mens issues then women shouldnt be designing the room and painting it pink and putting up lace curtains and a lot of frilly doilies jmo

2771920 do you really think the company would come out with a different size product that had a different colour label different name and different company name on the label does that make any sense to you

2771932 everywhere and nowhere safety security danger death your will is your territory and that comes from love love is the territory and for that there can be no symbol nor map love is a word elluding to a thing and the thing is a concept beyond conceptualization

2771934 know yea in extinguishing the candlelight that all extinguishable light is extinguished thereby and it matters not

2771941 any man who is under 30 and is not a liberal has not heart and any man who is over 30 and is not a conservative has no brains
2771942 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
2771943 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
2771944 the day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion it will cease to be free for religion except for the sect that can win political power
2771945 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
2771946 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
2771947 we do understand that there are security concerns in some of the states circles where spectrum cannot be allocated but wherever it is available there should not be any delay as the government had earlier announced in january this year that enough spectrum is available in most of the circles to accommodate all the new players as well to meet the needs of the existing operators
2771948 youll be pleased to hear that this is not true the only way one could reasonably say that a person eats eight spiders a year is by assuming a that you can add up all the spider parts found in typical foodstuffs e g vegetables rice hamburger buns until you reach the mass of a spider and call that one spider b that all spiders are as large as medium size tarantulas when in fact most of the spiders eaten each year are significantly smaller and c that spiders that crawl into your mouth while you are asleep dont count as having been eaten
2771949 but without making such wild assumptions one can only say that the average person eats 10 12 whole spiders a year and some two to three pounds of miscellaneous spider parts
2771950 right now the legislature is not in session so we are planning for the next session
2771951 this time of year the governors job you know is manageable
2771952 he is clearly running for national office and the proof is in his travel miles
2771953 hes caught between auditioning for a new job and maintaining his viability for his current job
2771954 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2771955 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from

2771957 requests for workplace accommodations of muslim religious obligations have become common around the country say muslim advocates in 2005 30 workers walked off the job at a dell inc plant in nashville after alleging the company refused to let them pray at sunset last year dozens of somali meatpacking workers at a nebraska plant quit their jobs because they were not given enough time off for muslim prayers though they eventually returned to work at the swift amp co plant
2771958 theres not words to describe that boy he was very kind and did everything for me he was like the man of the house because me and his dad are divorced
2771959 he would go around the neighbourhood helping people he would sit and listen to people who had depression or people who were alcoholics and help them clean the house
2771960 he would come in and say are you all right mum and give my head a pat
2771961 i told him not to worry about that our last conversation was good i told him how proud i was of him
2771962 maybe he was going to find out if there was a bomb he said ill see you in a minute
2771963 i went into the salad bowl i had tomatoes in my hand and i was giving the boy the money and i thought i think theres a bomb here im getting alan and im getting out of here
2771964 just at that there was an unearthly bang i thought i was dreaming it blew me back to the middle of the shop
2771965 i still had the tomatoes in my hand because once i got outside i saw bits of bodies limbs or something and i dropped the tomatoes with the scare
2771966 as the day went on i began to get really worried i was so worried i couldnt move i was paralysed with fear
2771967 my son pauls dog started howling and i thought alans dead it was the way the dog was howling i thought does he see him
2771968 i heard alan call mum i know that without a doubt i sat up in bed looking for him
2771969 when i went into the bedroom a sense of peace came over me i had an idea he was dead i believe he called me from where he was i had that quite a lot after he died
2771970 it was definitely alans voice people probably think youre crazy but i know what i heard thats always been a comfort for me
2771971 i remember alan every day not every year or 10 years the pain is there
2771972 i have had a really bad spell of depression at the moment this is one of the lowest spells ive had since alan died
2771973 im not sleeping well only about three or four hours a night sometimes ive bad dreams that would wake me theyre about horrible things murder and bad people my minds obviously disturbed
2771974 when i come off anti depressants i cry all the time and take panic attacks
2771975 i think some day i will make a fresh start out of here i would have to think about it very carefully because i would be leaving family

2771984 lee has created a concept for solar lights that blend into tree lined paths and sidewalks creating a beautiful romantic evening setting the lamps wind around existing branches collect light during the day and illuminate walkways at night since the lights use the trees as support they dont need additional poles that would just increase the urban ness of the scene

2771989 sometimes youve got to make a move to see whats going on
2771990 because a few people didnt get their boxes sealed doesnt mean there was fraud

2771992 for now im going to focus on helping him get elected and raising our kids
2771993 im looking forward to being a mom and a wife and a business owner
2771994 that was a really important visit im pretty sure i wouldnt have been as focused today had i had that moment with them yesterday
2771995 ive been a pretty selfish mom and a very unselfish athlete for about three years now and its time to put my family first its probably time to move on
2771996 i think the future is bright for both of us

2772000 it will be very interesting to see which way this one will go
2772001 hi all this might be the last thing i ever post on here but i need to warn you all
2772002 why not buy an extra 20 or 30 bucks of food i can store
2772003 our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid
2772004 he told president hu that this is an important aspect of the u s china dialogue and that the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect of our dialogue
2772005 the idea is at least to provide the orchestra with the funds to keep going for an interim period
2772006 some kind of a joint venture with the cbc or a total spinoff that would be supported by private and public funds
2772007 this allows canada to establish its outer limits once and for all
2772008 that gives canada the exclusive rights to develop the natural resources on and below the seabed in that area
2772009 if we can demonstrate that the ridge is part of the north american continent the danes can use that information to show it is also part of greenland
2772010 they can use it to define their outer limits to the east and we can use it define outer limits to the west and we both benefit
2772011 our initial look suggests that most of the key elements for a petroleum province may exist on the lomonosov ridge but that large uncertainties remain
2772012 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2772013 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2772014 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2772016 google translate for iphone is optimized for speed supports all of the existing google translate language pairs and uses a client side data store on your iphone to hang on to your past
2772017 i feel really bad for other people who bought that app like me because public ridicule is so hurtful were real people with real lives and lots of money not morons like everyone is reporting
2772018 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2772019 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2772020 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2772021 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2772022 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2772127 but when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away

2772129 but others fell on good ground and yielded a crop some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty
2772130 i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when i called none did answer when i spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in which i delighted not

2772132 its a great feeling to win our fourth trophy in four seasons weve got a great team spirit and work ethic
2772133 scoring that goal gave me one of the best feelings ever
2772134 i think the way that we have played this season i think we deserved this victory
2772135 i think theres no doubt some players will go so we have to start again
2772136 we have to try to keep this team and bring in three or four better players

2772142 it was nice to see jamie pick up two goals hes only been with us a short week and this game means something to him cause he was dropped by real so i think he had some internal motivation i thought he did very well today but i thought he faded also at the later part
2772143 its positive to have an extra addition to the team with what he brings one thing i have always liked about him as a player is that hes always had that chip on his shoulder and isnt afraid to work he feels that he can have a positive impact in any game whether its an assist or a goal
2772144 im still not used to swimming fast in the morning im used to swimming at night

2772151 the 11th ranked americans got a goal from angie loy in the 64th minute to even the score after falling behind 2 0 early and they left olympic green hockey stadium feeling good about themselves to play the world no 2 in the first game of the olympics and come away with a 2 all tie we are to a degree satisfied
2772152 i am not so happy with the result because first we were winning five minutes before finishing the game
2772153 when we saw the number of shot corners we had and the number of penetrations we had we had more than the u s a
2772154 the team have to look forward because its the first game and we had a point
2772155 we were a little bit on the back foot to start and argentina made us pay for that
2772156 our team is known to persist throughout the game regardless of the situation or the time or phase of the game
2772157 nous tenterons de le faire de tout notre poids pour que la tr ve se fasse et que les combats cessent

2772179 the more we can mobilize this community the fewer patents that will actually be granted
2772180 whatever happens in the patent reform world in the next u s administration is great but we have to act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
2772181 a production environment where we educate and train people to do this well work with them to make sure its put in a form that is acceptable
2772182 those are kind of the key areas to linux as it moves forward
2772183 i think now with gas prices the market is finally catching up to those policy objectives

2772190 has been criticized by u s authorities for a checkered human rights record
2772191 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2772192 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2772193 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2772194 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2772195 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2772196 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2772197 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2772198 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease

2772216 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2772217 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2772218 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2772219 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2772220 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age

2772240 foi mesmo le o xiii quem redigiu esta ora o a frase satan s e os outros esp ritos malignos que vagueiam pelo mundo para perder as almas tem uma explica o hist rica que o seu secret rio particular mons rinaldo angeli nos contou v rias vezes le o xiii teve verdadeiramente a vis o de esp ritos infernais que se adensavam sobra a cidade eterna roma e foi desta experi ncia que nasceu a ora o que ele quis que toda a igreja rezasse esta ora o rezava a ele com voz viva e brilhante ouvimo la muitas vezes na bas lica do vaticano mas isto n o tudo ele escreveu tamb m por suas pr prias m os um exorcismo especial que figura no ritual romano ed 1954 tit xii c iii pp 863 e ss recomendava aos bispos e aos sacerdotes que rezassem muitas vezes estes exorcismos nas suas dioceses e par quias ele pr prio o fazia muitas vezes durante o dia
2772241 e para que todos sem fadiga e sem obst culos continuar esta santa cruzada decidimos que as ora es que o nosso bem amado predecessor le o xiii ordenou aos sacerdotes e aos fi is que rezassem depois da missa sejam ditas por esta inten o particular isto pela r ssia que os bispos e o clero secular e regular tomem ao seu cuidado informar os fi is e aqueles que assistem ao santo sacrif cio e que n o se esque am de lhes lembrar estas ora es

2772246 you know what i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2772247 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2772248 if i asked my dog to run up that hill right now she would do it
2772249 she would never give up she just loves to work
2772250 within a fortnight she had pretty much forgotten about it she didnt once fall over shes pretty resilient
2772251 theres been no other research for us to look at so we cant predict what we will see we are not really setting out to find out something in particular we are going out there to gather information
2772252 we will be able to extract some information from it and then be able to feed that back into whoever is involved in working dogs
2772253 the overall aim is to increase the dogs longevity and performance
2772254 i am yet to meet a farmer who runs a farming operation which involves sheep or beef without a dog they are covering huge amounts of distance every day they also get places that vehicles cant
2772255 at the end of the day if you buy a two year old dog for 5000 and get five years work out of it youre paying them a grand a year where will you get any other worker who will work for a grand a year

2772257 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
2772258 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
2772259 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing

2772268 our goal was to always get a result against china which we did and then to get a something out of belgium
2772269 the end result of trying to get through to the quarter finals hasnt changed and we head into wednesdays match against belgium with a hell of a chance
2772270 the players werent in awe of brazil but they realise they were up against the best in the world
2772271 i think brazil were a level above where they were against belgium and we looked a bit tired
2772272 that just staggers me some of the things ive been hearing have been horrendous
2772273 how can he say we are not developing football in new zealand when we have got nine all whites playing for the phoenix
2772274 when was the last time he played for the all whites it was 2004 when they lost to vanuatu
2772275 its just disappointing ryan is an icon for the game given his stature in the premier league but instead of helping the game he slams it
2772276 our responsibility is to owner terry serepisos who puts in five million dollars a year to run this club and to the phoenix to make the playoffs and we are going to pick a squad we believe can do that
2772277 we are 12 months old so you cant say things like that when we are trying to establish the foundations of a club
2772278 the other thing that disturbs me is his comment about the phoenix not releasing players
2772279 its just the only thing that bothers you a bit is you need a squad
2772280 you end up playing a lot if you do get through the qualifying stages
2772281 every thursday night takes a bit of a toll on you unless youve got a strong squad of players
2772282 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2772283 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2772284 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit
2772285 he was in that spot before he got hurt and well just put him back in there
2772286 i spoke to sir alex ferguson and he said i want you to go to blackburn it will be a good opportunity for you so im just over the moon

2772290 now we ask from the west action actions to defend georgia to defend democracy to defend independent states and to defend the world order and we hope that this reaction will follow
2772291 las relaciones de rusia con naciones unidas y otras partes de la comunidad internacional se ver n afectadas por el continuo asalto de georgia y si sigue neg ndose a comprometerse con una soluci n pac fica a esta crisis
2772292 estados unidos urge a rusia a considerar cuidadosamente las implicaciones de esta agresi n contra el soberano y democr tico estado de georgia

2772305 wed be far better off being part of new plymouth district which has the population to help share the cost of such things are water and sewerage improvements in individual towns the way it is at the moment is hopeless
2772306 under the local government act the law does not allow any such proposal to get any traction if it would reduce any districts population below 10 000 waitomo is under that figure now so it simply cant happen
2772307 that means that if you live in a small centre such as mokau then youve got to pick up your own costs
2772308 for example without subsidy benneydale residents would have been paying 1700 each for their water scheme mokau is just under that subsidy line

2772310 for texas businesses the 2008 extension of 2007s trend toward court rulings on non competes will be a welcome development
2772311 key employees frequently left an employer to join a competitor after downloading the employers confidential information and trade secret technology obtained or learned during their employment
2772312 thanks to the texas supreme court employees now find it harder to steal and then use confidential and proprietary information to compete against their former employers
2772313 the consequences of not obtaining and enforcing a non compete can be disastrous to a small medium or even a fortune 500 company
2772314 with employees that it hires or adds through acquisition the company should protect its confidential and proprietary information in the same way it would protect any other assets
2772315 an employer must actually commit to providing confidential information for a non compete to be valid such information must be shared during the course of employment

2772411 as jons good friend i see the time he puts into the flashreport the rest of us should be thankful he is willing to dedicate himself to this great resource
2772412 the flashreport is a trusted source for news and commentary relevant to orange county and the state jons dedication and commitment to the advancement of conservative causes has propelled the flashreport into a must read for republican leadership in sacramento

2772424 this is end of my country as i know it
2772425 he was one of the arabs in an arafat style headband
2772426 he was going to find out that i worked for the iranian government that i had a security clearance that last look of kevin would be the last i would see of him
2772427 my knees were shaking i couldnt get up he took a lot of enjoyment in seeing me that way i was sweating shivering i was pale i held on to the chair and the walls any minute i thought he is going to realize he made a mistake
2772428 this is probably the last time ill see my country
2772429 why does america hate iran and want to attack us
2772430 american planes are going to bomb our homes just like we see them bomb towns and villages in iraq and afghanistan on the television news not just the government station but the bbc and cnn channels
2772431 our air force is small and only has helicopters how can it protect us from american bombers
2772432 those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it
2772433 i think everybody recognises what the consequences of any kind of conflict in iran would be
2772434 five or six pots boiling over in the middle east our nation cant afford to be mesmerised by one problem of iran
2772435 this constant drumbeat of conflict is not helpful and not useful
2772436 i expect that there will be no war and that is what we ought to be working for
2772437 when one starts such actions in the middle east one cannot manage reactions that can spread over years or even decades
2772438 i believe that we have the power to deter iran should it become nuclear
2772439 there are ways to live with a nuclear iran we lived with a nuclear soviet union weve lived with a nuclear china and were living with other nuclear powers as well

2772556 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2772557 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2772558 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2772559 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2772560 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease
2772561 lot of underline strengths are there which will keep growth prospects strong at a time when there is global economic downswing

2772564 i cant accept the viscera report since it does not say who attacked ishmeet and drowned him in the swimming pool how can anyone believe he could sink in a pool no more than six feet deep
2772565 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2772566 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2772567 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2772568 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2772569 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2772570 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2772572 despite our best efforts and support monika will not be able to participate in the olympic games here
2772573 with the weightlifting event at the games having already begun our persuasion with the organisers the international olympic committee and the international weightlifting federation was of no avail
2772574 the international olympic committee protocol following the technical congress that took place on the 7th at 1500 hrs makes it clear that it is not possible to insert change or otherwise modify any athletes participation or any other data for the olympic games

2772579 there are lots of interesting classes for local children including taekwondo and nunchucks
2772580 our party sacrifices if we have a road and if we want to send goods across the line of control why is it seen as a threat or a blackmail by the rest of the country i dont think anybody should deny us our basic rights there is no blockade in punjab but why they are sending goods to wagah border or attari
2772581 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2772582 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2772583 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
2772584 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
2772585 ive had two bikes stolen so i stopped buying bikes because they kept stealing them
2772586 on kickoffs theyve done better in practice than they did in the game the other night i think both were a little bit tentative it being the first pre season game they need to kick like chicagos gould did against us robbie did a good job kicking off against us
2772587 thats my challenge to them this week continue to improve on the field goals and pats and really improve on the kickoffs
2772588 actually in the team period neither one of them have missed for a while yesterday i had them both kick 60 yarders and novak made his and barth missed his that is the only miss that barth has had in probably three or four practices
2772589 i think kickoff return wise i like jamaal charles and i like dantrell savage i think bj sams can still do that and weve got to bring him along slowly because of the knee and make sure hes a 100 punt return i think he missed one opportunity the other night i think he should have taken it and he knows that i think hes a little tentative his first game back he needs to be more aggressive
2772590 people have asked me that all the time because of the rookie thing we went through last year
2772591 i understand why youre asking that but to me they are two different situations
2772592 we are facing reality we know that washington has its own agenda in mindanao and that this has mostly to do with terrorism
2772593 however if the american interest is really in pushing this peace process then we can talk about military bases
2772594 furthermore it would complete the us security arc providing additional strength to what the us has in place in japan korea and hawaii to forestall any chinese adventurism in southeast asia
2772595 yes the us is interested and no it is not only because of the war on terror
2772596 there are no talks along those lines the us is an ally of the philippines and at the moment military bases are not allowed here
2772597 as the institute of peace is not a us government agency i do not know what and if any discussions on this matter are or have been held but the institute is not in any way engaged in such talks as we focus on trying to help the two sides reach a viable peace agreement
2772598 personally i would be surprised if there were such discussion since the us military is working closely with its filipino counterparts on counter terrorism training
2772599 furthermore as long as the prospective bangsamoro homeland is within philippine territorial boundaries and sovereignty i believe the national constitutional provisions barring foreign military bases would prevail legal scholars and nationalists in manila would find it difficult to accept such bases
2772600 it is an ongoing discussion the two parties are close and manila has agreed one big problem is to find a formula that can be sold to the strong local opposition
2772601 we would like washington to make its position official like malaysia brunei and libya who take part in the consultations on behalf of their governments
2772602 at the moment the us is playing a clever role they are involved but only via the united states institute of peace
2772603 we have nothing against the americans as a matter of fact in our 30 year long struggle we have never hurt one american if they help then they are welcome
2772604 this early milf is talking about us miltiary bases in bje
2772605 use your good office in rectifying the error that continues to negate and derogate the bangsamoro peoples fundamental right to seek decolonization
2772606 the moro nation was accorded the political status of a us protectorate confirming the treaty of 1878 between sultan of sulu and spain
2772607 the united states will provide diplomatic and financial support to a renewed peace process
2772608 abandon the path of violence and addresses its grievances through peaceful negotiations
2772609 the united states absolutely supports the territorial integrity of the philippines we also recognize that the people of mindanao have legitimate aspirations and some grievances
2772610 the state department wanted to respond to milf overtures but was sensitive to direct
2772611 the state department was unsure of the milfs commitment to the peace process
2772612 as with past agreements a serious risk exists that the national legislature could scuttle any agreement signed by the government in the implementation phase the supreme court might also declare unconstitutional any deal on ancestral domain that grants moros significant political authority and control over natural resources a constitutional amendment might be required to protect a grp milf agreement but the prospects of this happening appear dim
2772613 the ability and the intent of president macapagal arroyo whose term expires in 2010 to press the peace process to settlement are also uncertain despite strong public statements on peace she has been unable to unite her administration or create a network
2772614 further because of her political liabilities she has not obtained a critical mass of support from the military the economic elites and the larger public her flexibility to make decisions that work against the entrenched parochial interests of some individuals and groups may be limited
2772615 scandals have buffeted her family and she has spent much of her energy fending off impeachment attempts if she makes serious compromises with the milf or forces significant change in the political and economic dominance of christian migrants over land resources and political power in mindanao
2772616 hijack the peace process with the milf to push her agenda of staying in power beyond 2010 through charter change or by declaring a state of emergency when hostilities erupt in muslim mindanao

2772621 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2772622 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2772623 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2772624 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2772625 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2772626 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah

2772631 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital he was in intensive care the whole time
2772632 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2772633 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2772634 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out

2772676 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job
2772677 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
2772678 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but

2772685 wir lassen uns durch politische dinge nicht auseinanderbringen sport ist etwas anderes als politik
2772686 wir sollten uns niemals dazu herablassen kriege gegeneinander zu f hren die politiker sollen die lage schnellstm glich wieder in ordnung bringen wenn sie das nicht tun m ssen wir uns einmischen
2772687 die residenz unseres pr sidenten ist nicht weit von meiner wohnung entfernt und wenn bomben auf tiflis fallen sind wir hier besonders gef hrdet
2772688 meine freundin hat sich schon berlegt vielleicht nach tschechien zu fliehen aber ich glaube nicht dass wir jetzt noch so einfach aus der stadt rausk nnen au erdem will ich bei meinen eltern bleiben
2772689 am meisten angst habe ich davor dass die russen in tiflis einmarschieren ich hoffe dass sich die welt einmischt und uns dann das schlimmste erspart bleibt
2772690 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2772691 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2772692 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2772693 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2772694 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2772695 we are feeling very very good about where the senator is in the polls and we obviously expect as america the american electorate turns their attentions even more to this race in connection with the conventions we expect to do to do quite well
2772696 i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2772697 so i think on things like that shoot i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads and well just let them do those ads
2772698 senator mccain is running the same old negative karl rove style ads that were all tired of
2772699 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2772700 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2772701 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign
2772702 hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month
2772703 i am twenty years old and am in college right now to be a preschool teacher i love kids have always babysat and would love to work with infants
2772704 goldie loves everyone and all other dogs and yes even cats i only wish i was as always as good natured and happy as she is

2772734 its been a boatload of money to put it colloquially
2772735 anybody who was willing to take on evaluations at any time and in any place could literally work around the clock
2772736 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2772737 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2772738 de russen hebben de vijandigheden niet gestaakt in zuid osseti de georgische troepen blijven schieten
2772739 we are on offense on the most important domestic issue before the country which is the energy crisis
2772740 we have blunted obamas momentum both nationally and in the key states where were ahead even or just slightly behind in a horrific political year
2772741 the most underappreciated dynamic of the race is the intensity advantage
2772742 thats why george bush won in 2004 they had an intensity gap and we have it now
2772743 people are very mediocre predictors of their own behavior what they tell you in june and july will not necessarily comport well with what they do in november
2772744 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2772745 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2772746 i was assured no economic blockade shall be allowed and every effort will be made to keep the highway open
2772747 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2772748 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2772749 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2772750 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2772751 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2772752 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2772753 wir m ssen uns allerdings steigern denn die gegner werden von spiel zu spiel besser

2772755 vielleicht ist es ja f r einige ein problem dass wir chinesen uns in den letzten jahren zu schnell entwickeln und das ist offensichtlich vielen suspekt die kommen damit nicht klar
2772756 30 leute schwirren um die herum die haben alle unterst tzung die sie brauchen
2772757 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2772758 we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2772759 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2772760 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

2772885 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2772886 over 750 000 british tourists passed through the airport last year on their way to the main resorts but very few stayed in the area and even fewer know about akkaya
2772887 although dalaman town itself isnt particularly picturesque it offers a slice of authentic turkish life and the surrounding countryside is extremely beautiful and there is a lot to do
2772888 ozdere is a secret the turks have been keeping to themselves the resort has fantastic beaches but is very laid back and the people are incredibly friendly
2772889 without the attention of foreign buyers prices in ozdere are lower than nearby resorts like altinkum and kusadasi it is possible to buy a really well built apartment within 5 minutes walk of the beach for gbp 36 500
2772890 ozdere is an excellent investment opportunity with good potential for capital growth the local rental market is buoyant with good quality apartments in demand for long lets by turkish families during the summer

2772897 we are supporting the georgian military units that are in iraq in their redeployment to georgia so that they can support requirements there during the current security situation
2772898 flights have in fact begun today and georgian forces are redeploying
2772899 god willing not only the georgian forces will withdraw but all other troops will leave our country and security and stability will come back to our land
2772900 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2772901 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2772902 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2772903 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2772904 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2772905 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2772906 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2772921 this allows canada to establish its outer limits once and for all
2772922 that gives canada the exclusive rights to develop the natural resources on and below the seabed in that area
2772923 if we can demonstrate that the ridge is part of the north american continent the danes can use that information to show it is also part of greenland
2772924 they can use it to define their outer limits to the east and we can use it define outer limits to the west and we both benefit
2772925 our initial look suggests that most of the key elements for a petroleum province may exist on the lomonosov ridge but that large uncertainties remain
2772926 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2772927 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2772928 when theres a problem with a licence plate there will be an alarm in the police car to tell the police officers theres something wrong with that plate
2772929 the police officers will have the picture of the car and will intercept the car
2772930 the purpose of the project is to see how it works in an urban as well as a highway setting that we patrol in
2772931 the system quebec police are looking at is a lot more efficient it can look at a lot of them
2772932 when i first joined the police if i wanted to check a plate i would radio it in and then our dispatcher would actually phone queens park and then somebody would have to go for a long jog down a long hallway full of files to try and determine who owned the vehicle
2772933 theyve got to go and pick up their drugs and do their robberies and theft and everything else
2772934 it was developed as a response to some terrorism that was going on over there and it was just a way for them to scan licence plates more efficiently instead of having to type them in
2772935 now the officer chooses the car that he wants and he checks the plate through the computer one by one
2772936 those who have had the honour of knowing master cpl roberts describe him as the embodiment of a brother in the truest sense of the world
2772937 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed which he lived his life by
2772938 sadly the sun has set on the life of another true canadian son dear friend and soldier let us never forget his sacrifice
2772939 hes the kind of guy we would describe as a soldiers soldier and i know thats a coined phrase but in actual fact he was one of those real guys
2772940 always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades any which way quite often they may not have realized it but he was looking after them one way or another
2772941 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2772942 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2772943 i certainly dont think it will be days i think it will be hours
2772944 but that all depends on what we run into if we run into some more problems or problems that we dont see now then it could be longer
2772945 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2772946 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2772947 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2772948 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2772949 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2772950 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2772951 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen im surprised that they let a company like that move in a residential area
2772952 those concerns always come up as to whether or not they should be in certain areas but like i say unless you want to put those facilities away and not build anything anywhere close to them any residences i dont know that you can do that

2772972 working together and with the best data we can manage this problem
2772973 the process should really lead to the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of how cities consume energy
2772974 cities compete in the market for business investment talent all sorts of things and finding ways to profit by tackling climate change can make them attractive
2772975 it is a terrible situation when you hear there is bombing going on in your country georgians and russians are both worried
2772976 the whole team has had hardly any sleep we were ready to leave the olympic games
2772977 it is not what the world wants to see it is contrary to what the olympic ideal stands for
2772978 its just an utter tragedy its as simple as that
2772979 all the advice we have had is that it was a one off random incident
2772980 it was a flying start it was lovely to see mahe out there dominating as he did but just everyone seeing caroline and georgina evers swindell out there enjoying it and rowing well was a real lift and a good solid start
2772981 clark and key have spoken with one voice on this matter the national party has no agenda no plans other than to be in government
2772982 silly me i had thought the privileges committee would move quickly to restore the integrity and good name of our parliament

2773079 vaughan was not moores type of leader he prefers them belligerent and bolshy
2773080 was announced a few years back and as the theatrical release came closer many of us who watched them in the 80s were either skeptical or completely geeked out
2773081 oh that kind of thing happens in europe all the time whats the big deal
2773082 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
2773083 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
2773084 any fool can criticize condemn and complain and most fools do
2773085 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
2773086 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
2773087 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
2773088 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
2773089 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
2773090 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governme walt whitman
2773091 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2773092 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2773093 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2773094 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2773095 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2773096 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2773097 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2773098 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2773099 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2773100 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2773101 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2773102 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2773103 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2773104 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2773105 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2773106 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2773107 the fishbein family came up with the idea of giving this trail as a gift
2773108 in 1993 we built our first green building but it didnt create the buzz this building has so we can thank al gore or oil at 140 a barrel our trail has come along at the right time and very much with a purpose
2773109 we wanted to see the composting toilets in any building approved and open to the public
2773110 if small children and international visitors accepted the bathrooms we concluded friends and relatives could accept this idea
2773111 the more we did the more we wanted to do
2773112 this stands as a shining example of what can and should be done in new construction
2773113 this building is very advanced and very functional but has much less of an environmental footprint than any traditional building would
2773114 if we are to live sustainably in the future we really have to change the way we live
2773115 climate change is the number one issue of our time
2773116 at mass audubon we are making a tremendous effort in this area
2773117 seven thousand people in july alone came through this building
2773118 a lot of people were interested in green features and how they could apply them to their own home
2773119 things can be a little more expensive but over time it pays for itself and uses less energy green materials dont have to be renewed and the more and more green materials are produced the price will come down
2773120 it had to grow organically and look like it was part of a whole
2773121 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2773122 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2773123 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2773124 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2773125 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2773126 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2773127 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2773128 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2773129 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2773130 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2773131 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2773132 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2773133 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2773134 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2773135 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2773136 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2773137 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind

2773142 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2773143 there will be more celebrities in denver than there were when the democratic convention was in los angeles eight years ago america understands celebrity and these people will be there to see obama it will help generate the kind of excitement we want to see
2773144 there will be photocalls with some of the bigger names and there are plans being worked out for ben affleck and matt damon to do some sort of gig on the stage
2773145 obama cant avoid hollywood even if he wanted to they have raised so much money for him
2773146 he was getting blasted last week for behaving like a blonde bimbo and what does he do he sends out gwyneth paltrow to do a get out the vote video it was like saying my blonde bimbo is better than yours
2773147 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2773148 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2773149 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2773150 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2773151 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2773152 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2773153 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2773154 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2773155 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2773156 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2773157 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2773158 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2773159 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2773160 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2773161 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2773162 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2773163 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2773164 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2773165 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2773166 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2773167 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2773168 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2773169 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2773170 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2773171 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2773172 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2773173 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2773174 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2773175 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2773176 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2773177 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2773178 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2773179 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2773180 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2773181 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2773182 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2773183 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2773184 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2773185 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2773186 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2773187 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2773188 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2773189 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2773190 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2773191 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2773192 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2773193 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2773194 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2773195 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2773196 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2773197 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2773198 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2773199 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2773200 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2773201 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2773202 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2773203 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2773204 just so you all know we did set a record
2773205 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2773206 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2773207 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2773208 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2773209 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2773210 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2773211 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2773212 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2773213 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2773214 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2773215 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2773216 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2773217 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2773218 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2773219 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2773220 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2773221 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2773222 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2773223 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2773224 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2773225 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2773226 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2773227 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2773228 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2773229 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2773230 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2773231 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2773232 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2773233 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2773234 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2773235 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2773236 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2773237 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2773238 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2773239 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2773240 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2773241 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2773242 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2773243 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2773244 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2773245 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2773246 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2773247 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2773248 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2773249 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2773250 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2773251 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2773252 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2773253 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2773254 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2773255 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2773256 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2773257 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2773258 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2773259 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2773260 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2773261 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2773262 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2773263 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2773264 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2773265 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2773266 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2773267 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2773268 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2773269 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2773270 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2773271 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2773272 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2773273 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2773274 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2773275 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2773276 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2773277 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2773278 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2773279 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2773280 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2773281 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2773282 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2773283 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2773284 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2773285 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2773286 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2773287 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2773288 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2773289 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2773290 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2773291 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2773292 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2773293 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2773294 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2773295 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2773296 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2773297 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2773298 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2773299 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2773300 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2773301 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2773302 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2773303 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2773304 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2773305 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2773306 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2773307 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2773308 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2773309 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2773310 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2773311 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2773312 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
2773313 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2773314 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2773315 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2773316 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2773317 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2773318 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2773319 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2773320 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2773321 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2773322 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2773323 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2773324 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2773325 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2773326 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2773327 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2773328 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2773329 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2773330 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2773331 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2773332 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2773333 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2773334 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2773335 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2773336 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2773337 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2773338 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2773339 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2773340 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2773341 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2773342 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2773343 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2773344 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2773345 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2773346 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2773347 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2773348 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2773349 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2773350 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2773351 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2773352 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2773353 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2773354 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2773355 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2773356 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2773357 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2773358 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2773359 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2773360 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2773361 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2773362 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2773363 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2773364 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2773365 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2773366 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2773367 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2773368 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2773369 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2773370 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2773371 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2773372 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2773373 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2773374 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2773375 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2773376 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2773377 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2773378 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2773379 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2773380 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2773381 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2773382 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2773383 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2773384 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2773385 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2773386 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2773387 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2773388 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2773389 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2773390 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2773391 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2773392 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2773393 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2773394 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2773395 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2773396 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2773397 antalyaya tatil i in geldik daha nceden rezervasyonlar m z yapm t k sava televizyonlardan izledik sava tan korktuk oras ok k t durumda sava n bitmesini istiyoruz
2773398 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2773399 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2773400 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2773401 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2773402 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2773403 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2773404 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2773405 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2773406 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2773407 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2773408 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2773409 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2773410 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2773411 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2773412 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2773413 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2773414 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2773415 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2773416 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2773417 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2773418 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2773419 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2773420 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2773421 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2773422 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2773423 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2773424 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2773425 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2773426 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2773427 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2773428 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2773429 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2773430 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2773431 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2773432 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2773433 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2773434 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2773435 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2773436 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2773437 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2773438 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2773439 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2773440 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2773441 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2773442 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2773443 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2773444 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2773445 algo que en madrid no ser a mucho pero aqu s porque se celebra en una villa de 13 000 habitantes que desarroll toda su capacidad para hacer frente a esta celebraci n
2773446 todo ello hace que o carballi o sea hoy la capital de galicia porque en la fiesta se concentran 70 000 personas y lo que nos llena de especial orgullo es que tambi n se celebra de forma simult nea en otras capitales del mundo como buenos aires
2773447 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark with animals committing fellatio and girl on girl action its quite unpleasant
2773448 the kafka industry doesnt want to know such things about its idol
2773449 perhaps kafkas biographers simply dont like the idea that their literary idol was helped out in this way in the vital early stages of his career of the worlds authors only shakespeare generates more phds more biographies more coffee table books everything kafka wrote every postcard he ever sent every page of his diary is regarded as a potential ark of the covenant yet no one has ever shown his readers kafkas porn
2773450 the many myths about kafka circulating among the semi informed public do include the idea of kafka as a kind of saint originally propagated by his friend max brod so its salutary to assemble evidence that he was human
2773451 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
2773452 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
2773453 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
2773454 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points
2773455 demonstrating that he too knows how to sell wolf tickets nagin on live television threatened to
2773456 my wife barbara and i started this business in 1992 as a means to support a very expensive sport namely bench rest my wife had been in the sewing business for many years her experience included sewing layout cutting and management so it was only logical that the next step was opening our own business i had complained about having to use a rag over my stock to prevent solvents that i was using from ruining the paint job on the stock and also seeping into the bedding area and softening up the bedding so between her expertise in the sewing world and my practical knowledge we came up with our first stokboot
2773457 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2773458 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2773459 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
2773460 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
2773461 ive had two bikes stolen so i stopped buying bikes because they kept stealing them
2773462 iphone 3g tutorial pwnage 2 0 2 jailbreak und unlock f r firmware 2 0 1
2773463 we have set a standard now and there are no excuses for not getting back to that level again
2773464 i guess it has given us confidence there is a bit of belief there and we have put the line in the sand now
2773465 i guess we have to make sure regardless of what got us to perform that week we have to make sure we get to that point again
2773466 its a hell of a challenge over here but its something the guys get excited about the challenge of facing this pack over here they are a hell of a good tight five and loose forwards is going to be big for us
2773467 you have to get parity up front the springboks they get on top of you over here and they are a bloody hard thing to stop
2773468 you learn a lot watching your opposition play i guess both sides will be trying to get an edge and trying to get that edge tactically
2773469 the games changed a lot under these new laws and unless you get an advantage playing those new rules you are in trouble you need to think it out now a lot
2773470 we played the old laws for a long time and i guess it had become trying to perfect what you were doing there now its a whole new ball game
2773471 perhaps once everyone gets used to these rules it might be like the old ones but for us its our fifth game under these laws and its the same for the south african coaches
2773472 i think its a different level of fitness too its more of an aerobic fitness than explosive you still need explosiveness too but you need a better aerobic base
2773473 the balls in play a third of the time more than it was so guys have to run further in the same amount of time
2773474 there is a lot more kicking and catching and kicking into space and ensuring you kick when you are in the right positions so there is a lot more research into that sort of stuff for the coaches
2773475 it may be a more skilful game for 15 guys on the field in terms of them all being able to catch and pass and that sort of stuff
2773476 will persist in the direction of introducing strategic investors to enhance the companys international competitiveness
2773477 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2773478 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2773479 you dont get to do too much tackling out in the centres and generally when youre playing on the wing you just catch cold but it was fun and im excited to be playing rugby
2773480 i got a little bit too excited at one stage but it was just a good feeling being out there and playing
2773481 im a professional sportsman and i know what i need to do to get out there and perform to my best
2773482 ive just concentrated on what i have to do and thats learning the game learning what the team is trying to do and learning my role within the team
2773483 im fully focused im a rugby union player now and ive got goals that ive set so this is just the start hopefully to a long and successful rugby career
2773484 theres short term goals and theres long term goals like playing for the all blacks
2773485 i want to become a dominant no 13 and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that tana has shown in me by getting out there and helping his team
2773486 one hundred per cent its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
2773487 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
2773488 i think probably a forward going into the forwards would be a lot more difficult because theres a lot of things that are different
2773489 in the backs its still hard because of all the technical things its not as easy as people think
2773490 its just all the little things i have to pick up the rucks the positional play the calls and the moves
2773491 you cant tell me were not doing anything to develop nz football
2773492 if we werent here where would shane smeltz be playing in the english lower leagues weve brought them back and look how theyre blossoming to the extent that premiership teams are showing interest in our players
2773493 and try telling the 12 000 people who turned up to every home match last season were not doing anything for new zealand football id invite ryan to come here and see for himself
2773494 do blackburn rovers go out and sign a whole bunch of young english players just so the national team does well of course not they are out to win the premier league and we are out to win the a league
2773495 terry is putting in 5 million a year to run the club to ask him to fork out that money to be a development club is ridiculous
2773496 we were asked to release them for five weeks ryan is only away for 10 days and is only playing two of the three matches
2773497 kaliumnitrat kan ikke anvendes til bombefremstilling det bruges typisk til fremstilling af fyrv rkeri ammoniumnitrat derimod er det oplagte valg til hjemmelavede bomber det er uhyre effektivt til bombefremstilling
2773498 vi var p intet tidspunkt orienterede om at det som var p bestillings sedlen var ufarligt vi er hele tiden g et ud fra og har f et at vide at alle de stoffer der var tale om kunne bruges til en bombe
2773499 i think thats the important bit its all well and good me saying no that im not going after playing for a long time but itd be unfair to put a daniel flynn or a tim southee in that position
2773500 for me personally i want to make sure that its a collective decision and not put in front of young guys because the young guys probably dont have the same options as the more experienced players
2773501 i know that theyll put players safety concerns first before they make a decision about turning up to the tournament
2773502 i was only there for a short period of time but i really enjoyed his coaching style hes a guy who had a good knowledge of the game obviously it was only twenty20 but hes been successful with victoria and he had success with delhi
2773503 hes got a pretty simplistic style but it was one that i enjoyed while i was there hell be one of the guys that new zealand cricket will have a good look at
2773504 im pretty sure he hasnt applied but things can change with wrighty so well wait and see
2773505 it was a flying start it was lovely to see mahe out there dominating as he did but just everyone seeing caroline and georgina evers swindell out there enjoying it and rowing well was a real lift and a good solid start
2773506 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2773507 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2773508 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2773509 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2773510 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2773511 nej men min grej kostade mycket mer tror du verkligen att jag vill byta ner mig s rent ekonomiskt
2773512 this guy was a credentialed member of the press he has every right to his freedom of speech
2773513 i thought obama did a great job of handling it
2773514 i was impressed with how well obama identified the issue engaged the person and defused the situation and then they just moved right on

2773522 its been a while it was a good confidence boost for caroline and me
2773523 we had a fair idea where we were but you never quite know until you line up against the others
2773524 it was satisfying it was funny we were talking afterwards and both thinking the same sorts of things as we were going down the track just focusing on one good stroke after another good stroke
2773525 it makes it slow but if you look back at the results my biggest win came into a head wind in gifu 2005 world championships in japan
2773526 it is not something im worried about there are certain guys who are better in tail winds and head winds but from a new zealand perspective we are all rounders we can compete in anything
2773527 im enjoying rowing with him hes got a lot to contribute for a young guy hes got a good head on him and hes got enough experience to pull me into line if i go off on the wrong track its very much a 50 50 thing
2773528 i probably expect too much but i do get annoyed when i lose
2773529 i knew it was pretty bad as soon as i hit the car
2773530 i was sort of hoping i could just get a discharged without conviction during the court case i was pretty worried about having that over my shoulders
2773531 the canadian authorities can use that as a basis for denying a visa
2773532 that was a great game friday night melbourne were unreal and so were manly and our standard certainly wasnt there today
2773533 theyre both great teams that play well as a team and at moment theyre ahead of everyone else unless a couple of teams get a bit of momentum going into the semis
2773534 were not as good as manly and melbourne weve got a lot of improvement to do over the next four or five weeks
2773535 well just keep punching away and do everything we can to make the top four and get a home semi final thats our goal
2773536 we dont have the time to step up anymore weve got to play for the money every week
2773537 whether were favourites or underdogs it doesnt matter anymore we have to prepare as well as we can and hope its good enough
2773538 they probably had enough possession and field position in that second half that you would have liked to have scored more points i suppose but full credit to the broncos they defended well
2773539 it is a big ask not just coming back after six months but coming back from what was a huge injury
2773540 he was really intelligent i thought he paced himself well you couldnt ask for much more really
2773541 i dont want to put too much pressure on wade because he has been injured for a long time but as he gets more football in him it gives us some more options
2773542 everybody agreed at the coaches conference that if contact was made with the kicker after he kicked the ball you know it wasnt going to be tolerated
2773543 it really frustrates me because everybody says that is what we are going to do everybody knows the rule and you turn up here tonight and it doesnt happen
2773544 players are at their most vulnerable when they kick the ball and they deserve to be protected
2773545 its definitely mind over matter the body goes through different phases you have to continually resist the physical urge to breathe
2773546 so when i get in the water ive got all my energy for my dive

2773572 oh no he not only shagged another woman while his wife was sick but he didnt use birth control either

2773606 spurred by the souring economy and a newfound willingness to embrace conservative candidates the democratic party is running its most competitive campaign across the south in 40 years
2773607 the partys rising prospects point toward a once unthinkable goal a reversal of the great reversal the switch in political loyalties in the 1960s that made the south a republican stronghold for a generation
2773608 if the current picture holds democrats could use the southern strength to help craft a workable senate majority and expand their majority in the house of representatives at the very least it widens the field of competitive seats forcing republicans to fight fires in once reliably solid areas half a dozen republican held house seats across the south including rural districts in virginia north carolina louisiana and south carolina are growing more competitive
2773609 but he decided that he felt more at home with the democrats whom he describes as the party of working people and the party of diversity
2773610 the republican party has done a wonderful job of making it appear that you dont have a choice but thats changing thats changing with me

2773619 it was a very difficult fire to fight because of the heat and the amount of fire was spread over a very large area
2773620 when the initial explosion went off or one of the explosions went off it obviously spread fire all over the general area
2773621 we had an unknown number of tanks i had various reports of two or four tanks that had flames impinging on them that were venting and burning
2773622 we have that down to one large tanker of liquified petroleum gas and one of them that was burning and venting is no longer venting or venting only sporadically now
2773623 he was filling up his truck and he saw some either smoke or some type of gas and went to report that and left the area as he was leaving the area there was an explosion
2773624 its not venting at all and it may very well be empty as well so the situation is better than before
2773625 i thought it was an earthquake with the noise and the way my building shook
2773626 our windows blew everything blew out doors were blown open our door handles actually came off light fixtures had fallen we had glass all over our staircase
2773627 were trying to get to all the residents in the area trying to get them out
2773628 its probably propane because its a propane facility but who knows it could be methane it could be anything
2773629 theres a possibility there were people in the building but nothing is confirmed
2773630 we wont know until the situation has calmed down until the fire is out we wont be able to get in there to investigate
2773631 other than this one individual we have not transported anyone else its people we have treated for minor cuts and bruises we have notified all the area hospitals so they are on standby they are aware that they could be having an influx of patients and many people will choose to go to the hospital on their own

2773713 its something akin to martial law in that particular area
2773714 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
2773715 in a way i like it because they shot up my house too
2773716 and in a way i dont like it because a few minutes ago i had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what i was doing and where i was going
2773717 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
2773718 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
2773719 notwithstanding the city code and curfew order the residents of helena west helenahave the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard to ride their bicycles along the streets protest this policy and drive around the city with the full protections of the first fourth and fourteenth amendments
2773720 i invite them to move in on second street and be up all nightwith people shooting at them
2773721 since this began its more quiet and peaceful around here
2773722 i think theyre doing a wonderful job prior to this the kids were dealing drugs right in the middle of the street stopping cars saying hey hey what you got
2773723 you couldnt walk down the streets your little kids couldnt either we were just that scared
2773724 youre not free and youre supposed to be free you cant go outside and walk the streets look the entire area is empty theres nobody out here

2773726 ronald scott the citys assistant police chief said police are using common sense whendealing with pedestrians in the lockdown area
2773727 the employee who i promised i would not name has been an employee there for a very long time and the employee gave me a run down of how things have changed at the refinery since the hiring of a new manager who seems to have questionable people skills according to this employee this new plant manager made everything personal and began threatening the union president and the union safety rep basically telling them they would be gone in 3 months allegedly in two instances in the recent past the company refused to act to resolve problems with equipment and procedures in the handling of benzene which is a known carcinogen the safety rep had to ask for the quebec worker safety board to intervene and they did supposedly when this happened became personal and the manager then decided to remove the safety rep in an industry where companies like petro canada makes billions in profits youd think they wouldnt have a problem putting up the money for simple safety but of course this is the same company that rolled back these workers wages in 2001
2773728 as you surely know i and my coworkers are still locked out despite the fact that the truth about the real reasons are slowly coming out a recent interview with ron brenneman exposed the reason for our lock out the national pattern is the target and we are the fall guys in this absurd game despite having 3 judgements in our favor at the labour relations board of which i will will include the links to petro canada is still defying the orders and continues to use scabs and continues to lie to the media as to the real reasons for the lock out here then are the links the documents are in french here here and here i can tell you that they have brought workers in from all over the country and seemingly from outside as well they have deliberately delayed our entry into the refinery for up to an hour which of course gave them ample time to replace the scabs we overheard on the radios with others this is a sad sad revelation of just how far they have gone to destroy us i have had confirmation that the majority of the scabs have been paid in excess of now hold on to something 300 000 so far this year meanwhile the company has been lying to the media and having them repeat it that we earn 120 000 a year which is a lie the highest salary for a unionized worker is about 85 000 and that is for someone who is a replacement or acting foreperson it would take many hours of overtime to earn 120 000 for sure a safe guess would be 600 700 hours of overtime
2773729 if canadians knew the truth about this lock out that they would not rally to support us by selling their under performing petro canada stocks and by boycotting at the pumps i believe in canadians sense of what is fair and just all we need is help to reach them

2773751 we are all on a learning curve here with the impact of the laws still very much fresh and new even to southern hemisphere teams
2773752 we need to see what impact the elvs have on the game when it is played on a wet november night in south wales

2773763 chinas economic performance clearly is no flash in the pan its growth this decade has averaged more than 10 percent a year and is still going strong in the first half of 2008 because its success in recent decades has not been export led but driven by domestic demand its rapid growth can continue well into the twenty first century unfettered by world market limitation chinas likely continued success will eventually bring an end to americas global economic preeminence requiring strategic reassessment by all major economies especially the united states the european union japan and even china itself

2773772 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
2773773 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
2773774 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
2773775 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
2773776 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is
2773777 as a couple with kids you really see the importance of it trying to get as many protections as you can
2773778 the degree to which commercial entities will go to disrupt a humanitarian project
2773779 this was a project that could operate outside the regular business world
2773780 and thats not an unreasonable expectation but it is in some ways threatening to businesses and when you threaten businesses especially very large ones they are going to react in ways that hurt you
2773781 he said that sort of thing privately to people i knew
2773782 there was a fair amount of that i was annoyed enough to say so and he apologised for it a lot of good that did
2773783 was not the how of computing but the why and the primary answer was learning
2773784 this was a very remote village no electricity no telephone no tv but the wi fi was so well done that when i asked myself if you look at the constituent parts they were all replicable and in most cases the prices would scale down
2773785 its crippling because like an suv most of the power in that machine is being used to drive the machine not you or i
2773786 its not working as well as it should because not enough people are connected at the moment
2773787 it was like you get married and then your girlfriend comes back
2773788 that intel viewed it quite as holistically as we did
2773789 but we came this close to not doing it i was advised by absolutely everybody to make it a profit making entity so we could make lots of money and then give it away but the non profit decision was important because it provided clarity of purpose first a head of state will talk to you because its about children and learning and not profit and secondly the best people will work for you for zero salary
2773790 he would go from prime minister meeting to president of country meeting and that was his sales model
2773791 and it didnt work absolutely not as we have learnt in the business world just because you have a handshake from the president or the prime minister it doesnt mean you have an order
2773792 it created enough hype and pictures of nicholas shaking hands with heads of state that back in taiwan where 250 engineers were working on it people felt part of something
2773793 it can take years to get a ui right so starting from scratch for me was a question
2773794 i left because the future of sugar was going to be bigger and bolder than just being confined to the olpc laptop
2773795 its hard to pinpoint a start date with the nature of ethnographic research in which ethnographers collect data over a long period of time
2773796 which is chartered to extend pc access to the worlds next billion users
2773797 that they waited until very late in the day to make it nearly impossible for olpc representatives on the east coast to get their side of the story in the first stories
2773798 if nicholas hadnt said what he said in january 05
2773799 this machine wouldnt be here and a lot of other technologies and discussions wouldnt be here he accelerated people getting access by probably years
2773800 they could keep on coming up with innovations and license out the technology take the money and fund olpc or they could open source the entire design of the computer

2773813 behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken for she is married
2773814 yes i know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this and i also kept you from sinning against me therefore i did not let you touch her
2773815 now therefore restore the mans wife for he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will live but if you do not restore her know that you shall surely die you and all who are yours
2773816 what have you done to us and how have i sinned against you that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin you have done to me things that ought not to be done
2773817 what have you encountered that you have done this thing
2773818 because i thought surely there is no fear of god in this place and they will kill me because of my wife
2773819 besides she actually is my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
2773820 behold my land is before you settle wherever you please
2773821 behold i have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver behold it is your vindication before all who are with you and before all men you are cleared

2773880 the most significant changes to the privacy act in the 20 years of its existence
2773881 there is a strong expectation that special minister of state senator john faulkner will commit the government to act on the alrcs recommendations and that he will introduce relevant legislative amendments in the foreseeable future
2773882 protection of privacy needs to be balanced against the public interest in allowing the free flow of information and upholding freedom of speech
2773883 it has not been demonstrated that existing privacy protections fail to achieve this balance
2773884 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media
2773885 the law would be irrelevant to ordinary citizens in whom the media has no interest

2773924 i warn you not to be lenient with criminals because they do not respect lives these street committees must not be user friendly to criminals but that does not mean that you must kill just catch the criminals and hand them over to the police
2773925 criminals have a lot of rights one of them is the right to remain silent so when they come to the station dont ask too many questions just put them in jail
2773926 if things go wrong in this country people look at the anc for answers because its the leading party they dont look at or criticise any other party thats the reason why its so crucial for us to take a leadership role in the fight against crime
2773927 the anc in the province is alive and ready to respond to the call as always
2773928 we need to lead in the fight against crime we have a challenge to defend our freedom and we cant do that without proper structures like these
2773929 we will make sure crime is reduced in this area and the province we want to rid the area of drug traffickers rapists and other criminals
2773930 oh my god how am i doing how am i doing how am i doing how am i doing
2773931 the two men were crossing the freeway when a car hit them one pedestrians head was decapitated and the other had his foot severed
2773932 at this stage it is not clear what led to the fight but alcohol cannot be ruled out
2773933 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2773934 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2773935 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2773936 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2773937 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2773938 we are feeling very very good about where the senator is in the polls and we obviously expect as america the american electorate turns their attentions even more to this race in connection with the conventions we expect to do to do quite well
2773939 i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2773940 so i think on things like that shoot i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads and well just let them do those ads
2773941 senator mccain is running the same old negative karl rove style ads that were all tired of
2773942 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2773943 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2773944 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign
2773945 hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month

2774010 this case should never have come before the court recent rulings have established that the second amendment guarantees americans the right to keep bear and use firearms to protect themselves their families their property and the sovereignty of the united states
2774011 this is another egregious example of judicial activism legislating from the bench and inventing constitutional rights out of whole cloth
2774012 for many years advancement of the liberal agenda relied upon judicial activism expanding on rights guaranteed in the first fourth and fourteenth amendments and some rights which had no constitutional basis at all now that there is a strong conservative majority on the court that same judicial activism has been applied to the second amendment and gun rights have expanded exponentially
2774013 obviously the founding fathers would not guarantee the right to keep and bear arms without inferring the right to use arms particularly for self defense what other possible purpose would there be therefore the right to responsibly use a gun is clearly implied and understood
2774014 the second amendment says that a well regulated militia is necessary to a free state a militia is an armed citizen force used to repel invaders which is just what these hunters were doing their acts fall well within the penumbras and emanations of the second amendment
2774015 we believe the second amendment was flawed by a typographic error and the pertinent passage was supposed to read the right of the people to keep and bear
2774016 those who rely on our courts to make law rather than to interpret it are playing with fire and should not be surprised when sometime in the unforeseeable future they get burned

2774076 we are the hardest working publisher in the business for new authors and it was fantastic seeing the long lines of retailers requesting autographed copies of books from our authors everybody said it exceeded their expectations
2774077 in the i decided to do something i had put off for many years i wanted to write a book but because i was unknown i couldnt get a publisher to take the financial risk eventually i decided to partner with a publisher which looking back was the best decision i ever made four best selling books and a news career later i make my living writing there are a vast number of undiscovered authors out there who could do the same thing we would like to partner with them to see through their publishing goals
2774078 the problems for new authors have only gotten worse since mega retailers like costco and walmart began carrying the a list authors books at big discounts many local store owners where lesser known authors are typically discovered simply cannot compete with these titans as a result of the downturn for mom and pop shops more and more publishers are focusing on a list authors exclusively while viewing investment in promising but unknown writers as too risky
2774079 most unpublished writers assume that publishers will take care of all their pr needs the truth is currently very few authors even well known and best selling ones receive high priority when it comes to promotion

2774097 he said you need to get in the real estate business
2774098 they dont need space now because they took it last year
2774099 everything you read says the economy is in the tank
2774100 the region will have to sustain above average demand over the next few years to absorb the new space in the pipeline
2774101 i had a vision for a boutique hotel in houston that was intertwined with the community versus something you just built off the freeway
2774102 its a much different lending environment than it was a year ago
2774103 but were all dedicated and were highly vested in the project were intent on getting it done
2774104 hey slim i told you not to go near those guys with the magnifying glass we were all doing just fine until this fiasco now slinky can t even go out without dashing from rock to fungi thanks a lot pal
2774105 we cannot guarantee service especially in buildings however rest assured were working to expand our network in that area
2774106 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
2774107 what we didn t expect was that russian troops themselves would enter georgia that russian military equipment would bomb our cities in various parts of the country that russian soldiers would be shelling villages and positions of georgian forces
2774108 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2774109 if you mess with us you will pay a price
2774110 i want to wrap this up its been 15 years im ready to get it over with one way or the other i dont care what the outcome is i just want the attorneys to do their business so i can do mine
2774111 what i have noticed is that the new signings have adapted really quickly it seems as though theyve been with us for ages
2774112 this is good as in football you need team work and the more we are united the better
2774113 i see a strong secure defensive line it only needs to be polished up a little like all the lines of play thats what pre seasons are for
2774114 when he asked this question there was a call on vanes mobile he picked up the mobile and he saw that osborn was calling him
2774115 hey vane we got a mission but this time you have to get 6 criminals you have to get all the 6 criminals and listen there is one problem and it is they make plans together but they complete them alone
2774116 what do you mean by they complete their plans alone
2774117 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2774118 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at his as half empty or half full
2774119 when i scored that goal we went and picked it up
2774120 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2774121 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands
2774122 if you look at the replay it goes right under the wall
2774123 unfortunately we were the better team for 70 minutes we let two points get away from us
2774124 after tonight well put this behind us well go to beijing looking for a win you dont go into these games looking for a draw or looking to score x amount of goals were completely confident
2774125 es verdad que noto mucho cari o y consideraci n por parte de la gente
2774126 me alegro mucho por ese reconocimiento de la gente conmigo pero no me siento ni me gusta nada que se diga que soy la estrella ni nada parecido

2774132 to minimize dust entering the camera through the lens mount
2774133 i try to serve the forwards in which ever way they want whether its at ground level or from a deep position my primary aim is to create space and movement and to take the initiative with the other midfielders
2774134 we could do better if we could score early on the games would become a lot easier
2774135 in any team it is important to have a technical leader we had one last year and when he left we replaced him with gourcuff who is an excellent technical player who can inspire the others to play well
2774136 you could also consider fernando cavenaghi in that category so having two on the pitch is a considerable advantage
2774137 we need to find a balance so our strike force doesnt paradoxically put us in danger

2774139 conquistamos um resultado importante diante do s o paulo mas tamb m ser fundamental derrotarmos o ipatinga pois assim temos chances de subirmos mais algumas posi es e terminarmos esse primeiro turno um pouco melhor depois teremos uma semana livre para trabalharmos melhorarmos um pouco a casa e ganharmos embalo para o segundo turno
2774140 acredito que a vit ria contra o s o paulo deve servir de est mulo para todos n s e de modelo para os jogos seguintes motiva o e empenho nunca faltou a este grupo mas a sorte n o estava sorrindo e os resultados n o apareciam na quarta feira isso mudou e temos que inverter essa fase negativa definitivamente j diante do ipatinga

2774142 las expectativas de crecimiento de las principales econom as de la uni n europea ue sufrieron un deterioro generalizado que confirm la ralentizaci n de la econom a espa ola y de la valenciana principalmente en la industria y la construcci n
2774143 a pesar de este contexto la fortaleza econ mica de la comunitat est permitiendo que sigamos creciendo y generando empleo aunque de una forma mucho m s moderada que en meses anteriores debido a la situaci n de crisis por la que atraviesa el pa s
2774144 menor a los meses anteriores siguiendo as una trayectoria de desaceleraci n
2774145 a pesar del bajo nivel de confianza de los consumidores y de las mayores restricciones financieras la actividad del sector servicios valenciano sostuvo su fuerte dinamismo
2774146 lo que se ha intentado compensar desde el sector p blico a trav s de un mayor impulso a la licitaci n
2774147 continu generando empleo a un ritmo elevado mientras que en espa a se destruyeron puestos de trabajo
2774148 aunque la persistencia de las turbulencias financieras el enfriamiento de los mercados inmobiliarios el encarecimiento de petr leo y la inexistencia de medidas antiinflacionistas por parte del gobierno central describen una coyuntura dif cil para cualquier econom a la valenciana contin a creciendo por encima de su entorno m s pr ximo
2774149 a sul americana n o atrapalha muitos times brigam e lutam para chegar nela acho que temos que administrar vamos analisar o jogo de quarta e ver o que melhor para o gr mio
2774150 trabalho todo o dia para estar em jogos como esse mas vou respeitar a decis o
2774151 todas as equipes pensam em chegar em primeiro mas a gente tem que manter esta regularidade
2774152 acho que tem sido a grande diferen a do meio do primeiro turno em diante os jogadores n o est o fazendo tanta falta quanto esper vamos
2774153 todos os jogadores que est o no cruzeiro hoje pensam num objetivo s quem est do lado de fora incentiva o pessoal do lado de dentro se for deste jeito at o final pode ter certeza de que o cruzeiro vai dar uma alegria torcida ainda
2774154 a portuguesa vem fazendo muito pouco para quem quer fazer uma boa campanha na s rie a n s n o estamos conseguindo nos acertar e temos muitas defici ncias mas ao menos sabemos quais s o temos agora que nos esfor ar no segundo turno e reagir
2774155 o time deles cresceu bastante e est numa posi o muito boa na tabela vamos ter muitas dificuldades eles estar o empolgados
2774156 o palmeiras tem crescido em um momento muito bom da competi o mas domingo vamos encarar um advers rio que tamb m tem chances de brigar pelo t tulo o botafogo sempre muito dif cil de ser batido no rio de janeiro
2774157 temos que ter o mesmo esp rito se corrermos e lutarmos como fizemos contra o vit ria vamos conseguir ganhar
2774158 claro que o jogo mais importante sempre o pr ximo principalmente porque estamos embalados e vamos jogar em casa diante de nossa torcida e contra um concorrente direto ao nosso objetivo esse campeonato brasileiro mostrou que n o tem dono e queremos muito estar na parte de cima nas rodadas finais mas temos que construir isso agora como estamos fazendo
2774159 temos que contar muito com o apoio de nossa torcida assim como o palmeiras contaria se a partida fosse no palestra it lia vamos precisar jogar com o engenh o daqui para frente se quisermos subir ainda mais na tabela de classifica o e o apoio de nossa torcida ser fundamental o est dio precisa estar cheio para ter cara de caldeir o e colocar press o no advers rio
2774160 sei que dif cil assumir numa situa o como essa mas vou dar o melhor de mim para conquistar o maior n mero de pontos poss veis estou preparado para dirigir o time contra o n utico espero ter uma melhor sorte
2774161 o torcedor anda preocupado com resultados normal uma equipe n o pode ficar tanto tempo sem vencer como o n utico est mas com o apoio do torcedor vejo a chance da vit ria voltar a acontecer no domingo e a partir da a gente arrancar rumo vaga na libertadores que nosso objetivo
2774162 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2774163 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2774164 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2774165 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2774166 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2774167 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2774168 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2774169 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2774170 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2774171 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2774172 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2774173 you find the house you love ill do the rest

2774175 the examination of the scene revealed the guard was imploded the being had a hidden weapon in on his body the weapon which was recovered and locked up contained a form of an energy directed beam the beam struck the guards body and imploded it the largest piece of a body part left was about the size of a quarter one eyeball was found intact the being lived for about one year after it was shot but it was in constant pain since our doctors couldnt adequately and effectively treat all of his problems
2774176 people tend to catastrophize and that leads to depression suicide rates go up we see an increase in drinking outbursts at work violence toward kids before their houses were like atms
2774177 now they feel trapped like a rat in a corner historically research shows rates of depression and suicide tend to climb during times of economic tumult
2774178 i just want to sit down and have some hennessy
2774179 were here to document that all the debris has been cleared out

2774182 we try to keep the borrower in the house by modifying or restructuring the loan
2774183 if that cant work out we want to take possession of our property
2774184 but they said there just wasnt enough income in the house to come up with a plan
2774185 i called and said i cant get off this property in three days i got 54 years worth of stuff i got two older parents
2774186 i want my property to move i dont want to drive everyone elses values down i dont want to be the lowest one on the market but i do want to be fairly close to that if its priced right itll sell
2774187 this is it i cant come back here no more
2774188 i hope it helps somebody to read about this they wont be boo boo the fool like i was
2774189 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2774190 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2774191 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2774192 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2774193 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2774194 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2774195 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it

2774227 stop worrying wenchie youre okay for now we just have to wait and find out in the meantime lets try not to worry
2774228 i know i dont know anything yet and theres really no sense in worrying and im not really worrying but what if i do have cancer
2774229 im sorry and i dont mean to trivialize the battles cancer patients and others are fighting for their lives every single day but i just dont want to deal with this
2774230 i just dont want to fight anymore im tired of fighting and bucking up and healing and integrating and working through shit and being responsible and earning a living and taking care of a house and a car and work and my health and doing what needs doing all by myself i just dont want to work so hard anymore im not going to fight this
2774231 stop worrying wenchie youre okay for now we just have to wait and find out in the meantime lets try not to worry
2774232 wenchie has such huge tracts of land i felt betrayed by my breasts and by them
2774233 no were not doing that not now if we find out somethings wrong and i need to come back out i will and then you can show me everything but were not going there now not while we dont know anything
2774234 am i in fact ready to leave and will i leave with any regrets
2774235 merely calcifications due to the fact that her breasts were atrophying as all womens do in menopause
2774236 okay lets get this over with once and for all
2774237 just look at them theyre the breasts of a woman who has been pregnant and nursed a baby a woman whos now in midlife whos experienced gravity just like the rest of us breasts come in all shapes and sizes yours are soft and pendulous and wonderful
2774238 i just wanted to distract you it worked didnt it

2774242 i decided to go down to have a look many people had crowded around
2774243 the taxi driver was seated inside and the ambulance medics moved him from taxi to the ambulance
2774244 the bus driver came down and asked for help to guide on coming traffic
2774245 the front of the taxi was badly damaged and part of the bumper fell off
2774246 two traffic policemen further down the road closed off the road
2774247 all the bus stops should have a safety barrier in case of accidents so the vehicle will not crash into bus stop
2774248 the police received a call at 11pm yesterday about an accident between a bus and a taxi along compassvale road near block 203b
2774249 before polices arrival the taxi driver was conveyed to changi general hospital conscious as he complained about neck pain
2774250 the police are still investigating the cause of the accident
2774251 now youve got this manifestation now you are willing to do something about
2774252 the feeling of worry is an emotional indicator that if you keep beating this
2774253 worry may seem logical but it never is try to talk yourself

2774256 chairman of election committee in the ppcc was hardly any position worth jubilation and more over we have seen his capability and capacity as a chief minister during his last tenure when he could manage to win only two seats and we in opposition captured eleven out of thirteen seats
2774257 this issue lies with in the domain of shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee and you better ask them
2774258 i remember the crash and then there was a beautiful light and then the chinese and the malay and i were standing at the gates of heaven an angel approached us and said that we were too young to die and that for a donation of 50 we could return to earth so of course i pulled out my wallet and gave him the 50 and the next thing i knew i was back here
2774259 the chinese was bargaining over the price and the malay was waiting for the government to pay for him
2774260 wed been fighting for a while on the seventh day we ran out of ammo
2774261 the reason why the impact of this type of music is not as great when it first comes out is thought to be because technically the intricacy of the music is not high and not sohpisticated although many critics believe it is because the music elicits a particular emotional feeling which gradually becomes worn out in time
2774262 what kind of pet shop is filled with rambunctious yahoos and hot jazz music at 1am
2774263 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2774264 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2774265 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2774266 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2774267 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
2774268 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence
2774269 theres just something about a sales tax holiday thats different from a regular sale
2774270 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
2774271 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break
2774272 its the same sort of family that collects coupons for the grocery store that waits for tax holidays to shop
2774273 the sales tax holiday is really more of a political gimmick than good economic policy
2774274 under the sundheim approach the purpose of government is to

2774320 whatever you do never completely trust three kinds of people lawyers chess players and beautiful women
2774321 i am here for more than a month helping yatris
2774322 this is the time i earn for my family we have no other means
2774323 we have never treated yatris like outsiders invading the valley they are like family
2774324 we have no problem here when my friend abhishek and i decided to leave for the yatra friends and relatives advised against it
2774325 we faced problems in jammu agitators threw stones on our vehicle at samba and kuthua we thought the worst might be waiting in the valley but we are surprised to see the hospitality and generosity of the people here
2774326 but it is all calm once i reached the piece of land over which battles are being fought
2774327 this is disgusting we must not be swayed by what is being said and done
2774328 our demand is supported by every believer whether hindus or muslims in the country
2774329 like gandhiji told the people of india do or die today you should also get ready to make sacrifices and struggle
2774330 the bjp born in 1980 is in the prime of youth today the ram lalla of advanijis rath yatra too has entered his youth the party is fully behind the jammu agitation
2774331 secularism means respect for all religions this doesnt mean that hindus be shown disrespect
2774332 it was essentially due to shyama prasad mookerjees sacrifice that the tricolour found the pride of place in the state j amp k
2774333 had he not made the supreme sacrifice mufti mohammad sayeed and others like him would not have become chief ministers there the present crisis has revived the old issue of the states full integration with the rest of the country why should there be two systems of governance in one country
2774334 how can kashmirs identity be threatened by the erection of temporary structures on just 100 acres of land for provision of basic amenities and that too for only two months in a year and what is kashmirs identity isnt kashmir an integral part of india
2774335 the meeting will definitely take place but if progress can be made if we are out of the meeting then we will not attend it
2774336 they should be flexible in their stand and help us resolve the issue
2774337 shyama prasad mukherjee had promised the people during that agitation that he would either get the permit system abolished or sacrifice his life today after the amarnath agitation we seem to have turned a full circle
2774338 they say how can you give land to outsiders in kashmir jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india and whoever raises questions about this issue will have to pay for it
2774339 mukherjee died two years after forming the bharatiya jan sangh under mysterious circumstances this party had to undergo several tribulations to reach this stage
2774340 i can understand the valley press being prejudiced and engaging in yellow journalism but the national media has been misleading public opinion on this issue which is a matter of great concern
2774341 whereas the truth is that the state cabinet in may this year had unanimously approved of land being given to the board
2774342 sinha is in the root of all this problem he should not have been made the governor
2774343 once again rama is suiting bjp they are raising the issue to become the pm
2774344 i take the word of the prime minister seriously i dont doubt the credentials of the prime minister who is a very good human being i am hopeful that his words would be translated into practice
2774345 we will monitor the situation for a month and take necessary action if the government promise is not kept
2774346 the issue is not about amarnath its not about a shrine they didnt have a problem when land was allotted to vaishno devi temple in jammu but they are opposing the transfer of land in kashmir every indian has right to every inch of land in india nobody can deny that right and if some people try to resist it is not a small thing they are questioning the identity of j amp k they are challenging the constitutional fact that j amp k is an integral part of india therefore we will oppose their move with all our might and we will win
2774347 that the final disposition of the state of jammu and kashmir will be made in accordance with the will of the people expressed through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the united nations

2774404 es el hombre que adquiere una dimensi n m s profunda de s mismo en el desierto no hay grandes desaf os pero cuando entro en una tierra entro a un objetivo ah comienza un desaf o como en el noviazgo en el noviazgo no hay desaf os en el casamiento empiezan los desaf os cuando entro a la tierra tengo un compromiso tengo que construir es la madurez es la profundidad de la relaci n y para eso tengo que estar preparado
2774405 hay un aspecto nuestro que a veces tiene miedo del compromiso pero debemos superarlo debemos saber que hay algo que s quiere el compromiso porque es en el compromiso donde est el placer y la plenitud que el creador infinito prepar para nosotros
2774406 qu es el templo nos dicen los sabios que el templo es el coraz n el coraz n del hombre es el templo por qu fue destruido el templo el templo fue destruido por el odio gratuito o sea que las personas comenzaron a odiarse tiene realmente una raz n profunda y eso lo vemos nosotros en nuestra vida cu ntas veces comenzamos una discusi n y no sabemos porqu y a veces por orgullo nos encerramos nos enfrascamos en defender un argumento y a veces ganar esa batalla es perder la guerra
2774407 el templo fue destruido por el odio gratuito y ser reconstruido cuando el hombre llegue al nivel del amor gratuito su reconstrucci n va a ser un milagro ese es el milagro cuando el hombre crea la situaci n correcta las cosas se revelan como en una casa cuando hay amor cuando hay comprensi n de la misma forma cuando los seres humanos revelamos comprensi n y amor suceden milagros y ese es el milagro del nuevo templo
2774408 cuando algo es completo significa que lo espiritual y lo material est en armon a cuando hay dualidad se separa lo material de lo espiritual y cuando hay multiplicidad ya ni siquiera sabemos que hay dualidad entonces la recuperaci n del templo es nuevamente recuperar la uni n de lo material y lo espiritual no como cosas contradictorias sino como dos aspectos de una misma realidad el cuerpo la corporeidad es parte de la espiritualidad
2774409 nuestro desaf o no est en escaparnos al desierto o a la monta a a meditar nuestro desaf o es afrontar la vida trabajar crear una familia una civilizaci n m s justa y eso es reconstruir el templo reconstruir lo esencial que es la vida en este mundo en paz y armon a

2774414 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2774415 i for the life of me cant imagine how that could be a proportional response to allegations that georgians had fired upon russian peacekeepers
2774416 this is incredibly serious because it could have led to loss of life its chilling
2774417 people are concerned about their safety but that is not affecting their work they are going to continue doing the research
2774418 this is the first attack on animal researchers we are aware of where there were children in the home
2774419 uc santa cruz may consider themselves an institution of higher education but they are also an institution of animal torture and killing
2774420 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age
2774421 all through his life he wanted to be a firefighter
2774422 matt hammer was special matt called me he was at a seminary school and said he wanted a job typically i want to meet someone before we hire them i want to look at their hands see if they can work
2774423 but as i talked to matt i made him an offer right there there was just something about him one of his callings was an evangelist minister i always had him do a morning prayer before we went on to a fire he wasnt maybe the greatest preacher but everything he said came from the heart
2774424 i can pretty much tell you exactly what they were feeling when they boarded
2774425 they would have been excited we all love to fly in helicopters
2774426 you run into the attitude oh you are just another contractor

2774435 whosoever innovates anything in our matter of this i e islam which is not part of it then it is rejected
2774436 whosoever does an action which is not according to our matter i e islam then it is rejected
2774437 i will pray all night the other said i will fast continuously and the last said i will not marry
2774438 as for me i stand during the night pray and sleep and i fast and break my fast and i marry so the one who dislikes my sunnah then he is not from me
2774439 whomsoever fears stays away from doubtful matters verily he has protected his deen and his dignity and whomsoever falls into doubtful matters regularly falls into haram and then the messenger sa gave an example in the hadith just like the verse in surah hajj verse11 and then he said
2774440 and it is an honourable and respected book falsehood cannot come to it from front nor from behind it is sent down by the wise worthy of all praise
2774441 allah looks at his creation in the night of and he forgives all his creation except for a mushrik the one who associates partners with allah swt in his essence names and attributes or a mushaahin one having hatred against his brothers or one leaving the true group of muslims
2774442 and about the virtue of night of 15th night of shaban there are many ah deeth and verily they are differed upon and the majority of the scholars have weakened them and ibn hibban authenticated some of them
2774443 and i would not ever see him sa fast more than in the month of shaban
2774444 that is a month shaban people are heedless of it is between rajab and ramadhan and it is a month where in the good deeds ascend to the rabb of al aalameen and i love my deeds to be raised up while i am fasting
2774445 seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light

2774447 western media is a well organized machine which is showing only those pictures which fit in well with their thoughts we find it very difficult to squeeze our opinion in the pages of their newspapers
2774448 just as it was 20 30 years ago it remains the same today objectivity is not a typical trait of some western journalists and television channels

2774454 the international community and the most influential countries in the current situation to make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at reaching a peaceful and lasting solution for the sake of open and respectful coexistence
2774455 in the increasingly dramatic news of the tragic events taking place in georgia these beginning from the region of south ossetia have already caused many innocent victims and forced a great number of civilians to leave their homes it is my earnest hope
2774456 that the military action may cease immediately and that partly in the name of a shared christian heritage further violent conflict and retaliation may be avoided which could degenerate into a much more widespread conflict may the path of negotiation and respectful constructive dialogue be taken instead avoiding further devastating suffering for those beloved peoples i also call upon the international community and the most influential countries in the current situation
2774457 to make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at reaching a peaceful and lasting solution for the sake of open and respectful coexistence together with our orthodox brethren
2774458 let us pray intensely for these intentions which we entrust confidently to the intercession of the most holy virgin mary mother of jesus and of all christians
2774459 degrading experiences that not infrequently end in terrible tragedy this
2774460 is a typical result of the current so called society of well being which in order to fill an interior emptiness and the boredom that accompanies it leads to experiments with new more exciting more extreme experiences
2774461 that in a society that is always in a hurry vacation may be a time of true relaxation during which we may set aside moments for recollection and prayer which are indispensable for profoundly rediscovering ourselves and others once again
2774462 the journalists and workers in the mass media who have followed me during this vacation i thank you dear friends
2774463 for your work and i assure you of my prayers for your personal and professional intentions
2774464 we had a meeting several weeks ago with three priests of the legion and they handed over a rather significant volume of information concerning membership and the programs that they run
2774465 we are fully in agreement with what the archbishop has asked us to do
2774466 particular difficulties had been identified concerning the transfer of individual properties
2774467 the primary purpose of these meetings was to impress upon them the need to expedite and finalise the transfer and to ensure that their legal representatives co operate fully with the chief state solicitors office in making this possible

2774472 the four of us set out to do something that not a lot of people thought we could do
2774473 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2774474 i just think he was caught up in the moment
2774475 there are a lot of middle aged men and women who i know that tell me that im an inspiration to them and theyre now doing things they thought they couldnt do
2774476 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2774477 but getting bronze does still leave me a little bit hungry for things that are a little higher it will just drive me all week

2774491 bill customs tariff law is very important as it took in consideration even the air conditioner of 8a function in customs tariffs will be limited and little while we impose higher tariffs on conditioner operating with 20a
2774492 goods that enter without tariffs and without fees had harmful influence on the work of private and mixed industry because the prices of raw materials and the cost of producing the private sector are higher than we imported and this law for consumer protection and preservation of the private and mixed sector through the non admission of goods with the trademark
2774493 dividing the number of instance of profanity by the number of pages of the sites on which they appear then multiplying the result by 100 yields what might be called a profanity quotient
2774494 thats quite a disparity liberals are more than 12 times as likely to use profanity as conservatives on the web
2774495 fascism was widely viewed as a progressive social movement with many liberal and left wing adherents in europe and the united states
2774496 weve been seeing about 75 to 100 new kids a year for the past four or five years our elementaries are full to the point were using portables
2774497 we saw the spike about three years ago when we had about 125 new students at one time
2774498 i think confining our scope to what was needed helped
2774499 we even looked at ceiling heights that saved costs and didnt alter the logistics of the project
2774500 there are some changes that are either now or later
2774501 the way were looking at things more than likely we will have the transition to move them over before the winter break

2774506 over 750 000 british tourists passed through the airport last year on their way to the main resorts but very few stayed in the area and even fewer know about akkaya
2774507 although dalaman town itself isnt particularly picturesque it offers a slice of authentic turkish life and the surrounding countryside is extremely beautiful and there is a lot to do
2774508 ozdere is a secret the turks have been keeping to themselves the resort has fantastic beaches but is very laid back and the people are incredibly friendly
2774509 without the attention of foreign buyers prices in ozdere are lower than nearby resorts like altinkum and kusadasi it is possible to buy a really well built apartment within 5 minutes walk of the beach for gbp 36 500
2774510 ozdere is an excellent investment opportunity with good potential for capital growth the local rental market is buoyant with good quality apartments in demand for long lets by turkish families during the summer
2774511 one thing all consumers should know is that their money is safe

2774516 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2774517 early baptists never elevated their confessions to the status of creeds confessions include creeds exclude early baptists were careful to emphasize that confessions were merely human statements that they might later be revised and that in no wise could they ever approach the authority of scripture
2774518 a smug prideful abstainer without jesus is just as lost as the poor drunkard who is always in search of another drink
2774519 a drunkard who is always in search of another drink
2774520 why should one not wish to abstain simply speaking it is never wise to encourage the total restriction of something the bible could have rejected also but chose not to do
2774521 it is never wise to encourage the total restriction of something the bible could have rejected also but chose not to do
2774522 what reasons might one have for not abstaining one reason is because it does not seem logical to encourage command the the total restriction of something the bible could have rejected also but chose not to do
2774523 your question assumes that the hypothetical ones desire is to refrain from abstaining
2774524 hey anyone here an alcoholic anyone daniel what about you kevin sarah no okay then im gonna get us a bottle of wine
2774525 part of making a trade is someone has to want you right now theres no one that has expressed an interest in him thats where were at

2774527 given his current situation zaun said he would relish the chance to be a backup for a contender or to provide a veteran presence as a starter for a team like the marlins
2774528 i can deal with less playing time i just want to do it with a better team than this one
2774529 we wanted rod as number one until he backed out last season so well just go to zaun
2774530 i can deal with less playing time on a better team
2774531 if i have to be a backup id rather do it for a contending team
2774532 this allows canada to establish its outer limits once and for all

2774546 i had thought of resigning but thought against it because i dont want people to say im a coward
2774547 one must acknowledge that the ancients however noble imbibed without reluctance evidently the prophets and the apostles did not view this as wrong so long as it was a small glass of wine taken with the noon or evening meal
2774548 can it be anything less than sin for a believer who is genuinely grateful for the atoning power of christ in his life to pursue anything other than the highest gods ideal the best that he can be for christ
2774549 the noticeable absence of any mention of wine prior to noah might indicates sic that men in their pristine state were not drawn to wine in any case the fuller revelation in christ plus the development of superior medications and purer drinking substances render the whole subject pass for the believer
2774550 is too simplistic his case for superior medicine and better drinking substances does not negate the celebratory function of wine as found in both the old and new testaments
2774551 the bishop pastor is to be free from wine 1 timothy 3 3 one would presume that this admonition at least in part is for an example if so here again the ideal would be total abstinence for all who make up the body of christ i e the church
2774552 for the believer to say let me get as close to sin as i can without being guilty indicates a strange mentality indeed
2774553 the bible has almost no good word about wine and in fact usually associates tragedy and sin with the use of wine
2774554 the greek word translated given to wine paroinos means one who drinks it doesnt refer to a drunkard thats an obvious disqualification the issue here is the mans reputation is he known as a drinker we saw that the greek word translated temperate v 3c refers in its literal sense to one who is not intoxicated paroinos on the other hand refers to ones associations such a person doesnt frequent bars taverns and inns he is not at home in the noisy scenes associated with drinking his lifestyle is not that of a drinker
2774555 not addicted to wine which translates greek word paroinos literally having the idea the word oinos is a word for wine para to be alongside wine this requirement by the way is also given in 1 timothy 3 3 there it says basically the same thing not being alongside wine youll notice in chapter 2 of titus verse 3 older women are not to be enslaved to much wine back in 1 timothy it talks about deacons not being given to much wine as well so we find that not only those in leadership but even those in the church as such indicated by these older women in titus chapter 2 are not to be the kind of people who are associated with wine now what does he mean by this well its important for us to understand it we could broaden our concept a little bit if we remember that in 1 timothy 3 we also have another requirement which is the word temperate greek nephalios it originally meant that he was to abstain from wine a temperate person was an abstainer from wine it came metamorphically to mean circumspect alert or clear headed but the idea is the same anybody in spiritual leadership is to be clear headed so never is he to be given over to anything that dulls the clarity of his mind pastors elders are to be in control of their senses at all times then there is the interesting mention of timothy in 1 timothy 5 23 where paul says take a little wine for your stomachs sake it certainly seems to me that the fact that paul had to tell timothy to do that meant that it was against the grain of what timothys normal behavior was like he had to say take a little wine for medicinal purposes most likely because timothy normally wouldnt take any if the nazarites lived at that level then certainly those who were leaders in the church would live at that level
2774556 vigilant this word ne phaleos occurs only here and in 1ti 3 11 tit 2 2
2774557 then it denotes as it does here one who sits by wine that is who is in the habit of drinking it it cannot be inferred from the use of the word here that wine was absolutely and entirely prohibited for the word does not properly express that idea it means that one who is in the habit of drinking wine or who is accustomed to sit with those who indulge in it should not be admitted to the ministry the way in which the apostle mentions the subject here would lead us fairly to suppose that he did not mean to commend its use in any sense that he regarded its use as dangerous and that he would wish the ministers of religion to avoid it altogether in regard to its use at all except at the communion or as a medicine it may be remarked that a minister will do no injury to himself or others by letting it entirely alone he may do injury by indulging in it
2774558 second patterson mentions that the first time wine is ever mentioned in the bible gen 9
2774559 but i am grateful that he did not simply skip over them
2774560 this person was not the driver of a vehicle and during our dinner exhibited absolutely no change in behavior due to alcohol consumption there were six of us at dinner only two of us abstained from drinking and the funny thing was that no one made a deal of it at all
2774561 i dont suspect they would allow such generational differences to be pushed on them if younger people said that technology is so important that no one serving in leadership could be without a cell phone and detailed knowledge of how to email surf the web and have their own blog

2774570 well when youve been with a ball club for so long and you have had a lot of success obviously its kind of tough to break ties and go in a whole new direction
2774571 but again as weve seen throughout this whole saga its a business and sometimes organizations try to put a leash on you and try to control everything thats there and i guess if it happens to brett it can happen to all of us
2774572 its a lot different than last year a lot different than last year and it will show but thats not what its really about its about just going out and trying to make plays and trying to win games
2774573 it was an experience it was a learning experience i got a chance to see how fast the game was i only got a taste of it in practice
2774574 you know it really was tough because you couldnt get in a pass rush rhythm
2774575 they werent dropping back much they wanted to run the ball and we held our own
2774576 well i thought the whole offensive line did a great job in the run game and in the pass game and that includes max
2774577 he was excited about his performance and we were excited as well
2774578 do richard and i read the same gospels in the same way

2774580 wow these are great people they gave up a weeks worth of vacation they gutted out my entire house they saved me 6000 they told me about jesus and to top it off they are real people who have the ability to enjoy alcohol responsibly
2774581 tired because ive had to read some bad blogging these days
2774582 i think if you drink you shouldnt go to church
2774583 oh its okay you can drink and go to church not a big deal the bible doesnt forbid it

2774587 hatley said his primary concern about burlesons attendance at the trustee forums has been driven by concerns for the security of imb workers worldwide hatley said the whole purpose of the forum is so we can talk about places where we have to keep our missionary stuff secret and if you put that on blog sites you cant be a trustee in those meetings
2774588 judge not and you will not be judged condemn not and you will not be condemned forgive and you will be forgiven
2774589 therefore you have no excuse o man every one of you who judges for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you the judge practice the very same things
2774590 a posting sensitive material that was discussed in forum which has compromised the safety of missionaries
2774591 the bot as a whole may or may not be at some point in the future duplicitous
2774592 it is entirely possible and plausible that hatley was voicing concern that burleson might unintentionally publish sensitive information via his blog

2774631 as a result of this incident though weve elected to give up on renting any more land
2774632 since the time of this incident ive had a nagging feeling that it would be appropriate for someone to contact prokofy nevas bosses at the united nations and have a candid discussion about some of her exploits in virtual worlds after all is it really safe or consistent with united nations security interests to have someone with this mindset translating for foreign diplomats her name is available on the internet so it shouldnt be much of a challenge for anyone wishing to rise to the occasion

2774680 we have been astonished by the achievement of our book project and all the work is down to our team of dedicated volunteers without whom this work could not have taken place
2774681 it was our original target for 2008 to distribute 5 000 books into schools but having already reached that target we have now set our sights on providing 10 000 free books before the end of the year
2774682 our two volunteers have worked tirelessly collecting and sorting books and contacting schools throughout the region
2774683 an attack on the secretariat is an attack on the institution
2774684 the time has come for us all to show our responsibility and to end a deteriorating process
2774685 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2774686 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2774687 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2774688 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2774689 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2774690 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2774691 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2774692 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2774693 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2774694 id think wed try to keep him at around 80 pitches this time
2774695 well see how it goes in terms of how stressful his innings might be
2774696 he had pretty good command of his pitches in his last time out and that certainly was encouraging his velocity is getting there so is his stuff but were still being a little careful because its only a year removed from surgery
2774697 its tough to have to go through that long rehabilitation process and not be able to compete for month after month
2774698 its something ive had to go through twice now but ive never been someone who starts asking why me or anything like that as tough as it might be you have to accept that injuries are part of the game sometimes and you have to do what you have to do to come back
2774699 the doctors and the coaches all tell me that the command of my pitches is the last thing to come back after a long layoff
2774700 so im pretty pleased with that aspect of things so far
2774701 im just trying to give my team a chance to win every game i start whether its five innings or whatever thats really all i can do at this point to try to stay strong and give my team the best innings i can pitch the good thing is that theres two months left to the season a lot of time for us to come back and get to the playoffs and for myself the goal will continue to be to keep getting stronger and hopefully get back to being the pitcher i was three years ago
2774702 so far everything is fine but we all spend all our time worrying
2774703 the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games opening ceremony
2774704 a war is always something abnormal but when it happens at the moment when the olympic flame lights up it is a thousand times worse
2774705 it is very difficult for us georgians because of everything that is going on at home
2774706 last night the president mikheil saakashvili called and told us we better stay in beijing we couldnt sleep all night we were up until one or two in the morning all we could think about was georgia
2774707 the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship
2774708 we have had so many big wars in the 20th century what we need is peace that is something politics can learn from sport
2774709 i have won many friends through sport not only in russia but in many other countries nino competed for the soviet union for many years we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport
2774710 for us there is no georgian issue its just georgian athletes
2774711 ellos nos defendieron muy bien nos obligaron a tomar tiros desde posiciones inc modas y f jate que apenas encestamos un 23 por ciento de tiros de tres puntos
2774712 it was a lot less threatening but no less terrorizing
2774713 i began reading everything i could while i was in there
2774714 it was a new building very soothing freshly painted floors waxed inmates older
2774715 i was so deceived by the appearance of the place i let my guard down as a result of that i was raped and beaten and that was just the beginning of a long road
2774716 i was convicted for raping a 12 year old black girl and everyone in prison knew that
2774717 i felt then that with the evidence destroyed my life was actually over
2774718 i fell out of my chair and burst into tears evidence meant i was going home and i knew that
2774719 in many of these cases it is pure luck that results in exoneration
2774720 its a whole different world than in 1989 you cant imagine how stupid a person feels when you cant pump gas
2774721 a lot has changed in the last 20 years my son was born seven months after i was locked up and my mother is a little old lady now its difficult to get to know my family again
2774722 what is most important to me is that i survived i hope to think i am on my way back i am blessed
2774723 ive seen other cases where i believe people were factually innocent and evidence has been destroyed for me this case was just a small reward for all the pain weve had on those other cases

2774783 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
2774784 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
2774785 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
2774786 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
2774787 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
2774788 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen
2774789 the stakes couldnt be higher even the snopes anti rumor site acknowledges that obamas constitutional fitness to be president depends solely on his being born in the united states because his mother not yet 19 at the time of his birth would not have had a sufficient number of years as an adult citizen according to the laws prevailing at the time to pass on natural born citizenship automatically
2774790 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
2774791 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
2774792 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
2774793 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states

2774831 wir k nnen sexuell nicht treu sein und wollen andere beziehungen aber wir haben keine geheimnisse voreinander und gehen nie auseinander unter keinen umst nden
2774832 liebe bedeutet sicherheit aber die lust ist riskant die grausame wahrheit ist doch die je unf higer man zum sex ist desto f higer ist man zur liebe dem reinen gef hl es steigert die sexuelle lust nie auch nur einen deut wenn man jemanden liebt oder mag im gegenteil wenn man jemanden nicht mag verabscheut oder gar hasst kann es viel lustvoller sein man denke nur an die aggression ja gewalt die zu gutem sex geh rt
2774833 oh gott wenn ich das jetzt mache findet sie mich vielleicht ekelhaft

2774847 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet i will not have this debate trivialized by their excuses for their failed policy
2774848 im not sure exactly when but well get him up here and ill have a chance to talk to him and see how hes doing and where hes at
2774849 i want to see him first before i made any judgments
2774850 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everything is set up for him here so he can be successful
2774851 im going to gradually feed him back in and i just want to see how hes doing thats my primary focus right now
2774852 i know there is some apprehension there but i know he wants to come back and get back going and back up here with the guys
2774853 ps as you know russia start a new war with georgia it is ugly and already 15000 people killed russia having a very strong propaganda against america and wants usa in all consequences in this conflict it must be stooped please i need your help to being attention of american people if you feel you can do it please support petition against war in georgia send your e mail to russian foreign office share it with your friends please
2774854 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2774855 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2774856 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2774857 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2774858 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2774859 we are feeling very very good about where the senator is in the polls and we obviously expect as america the american electorate turns their attentions even more to this race in connection with the conventions we expect to do to do quite well
2774860 i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2774861 so i think on things like that shoot i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads and well just let them do those ads
2774862 senator mccain is running the same old negative karl rove style ads that were all tired of
2774863 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2774864 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2774865 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign
2774866 hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month

2774872 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2774873 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2774874 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2774875 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2774876 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2774877 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2774878 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2774879 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2774884 those education market figures dont include apples sales to students in the consumer market where it is even stronger apple like other computer vendors is in the thick of the back to school selling season
2774885 what weve seen over the last couple of years is a significant increase in the number of students who own an apple laptop or apple desktop or plan to buy one said eric weil managing partner of student monitor a market research firm that tracks spending by college students in a spring survey of college students planning to buy notebook pcs this year 43 said they were looking to get apple laptops it was far and away the no 1 brand with almost twice the response rate of no 2 vendor dell which got 22
2774886 apples resurgent mac business is beginning to chip away at the market share of rivals who sell machines running microsofts windows operating system
2774887 the question apple faces now is whether to lower prices to go after even more market share

2774939 all living beings have the buddha nature and can become buddhas
2774940 why does the farmer beat his ox why must one creature eat another to live
2774941 the kind of seed sown will produce that kind of fruit those who do good will reap good results those who do evil will reap evil results if you carefully plant a good seed you will joyfully gather good fruit
2774942 fetch me a handful of mustard seeds and i will bring your child back to life
2774943 but the seeds must come from a family that has not known death
2774944 there is death in every family everyone dies now i understand your teaching
2774945 no one can escape death and unhappiness if people expect only happiness in life they will be disappointed
2774946 there is happiness in life happiness in friendship happiness of a family happiness in a healthy body and mind but when one loses them there is suffering
2774947 do not earn your living by harming others do not seek happiness by making others unhappy
2774948 but even a five year old child can understand that
2774949 but even an 80 year old man cannot do it
2774950 life is dear to all beings they have the right to live the same as we do
2774951 take a look at this man he will certainly lose his wealth and good name his body will grow weak and sickly day and night he will quarrel with his family and friends until they abandon him the worst thing is that he will lose his wisdom and become stupid
2774952 just as a bird takes its wings with it wherever it flies so the monk takes his robes and bowl with him wherever he goes
2774953 the monks live alone in huts called kutis they are built on stilts to keep the animals and insects out there they practice sitting and walking meditation which is very important for their spiritual life in front of each hut is a path for walking meditation the monks sweep them clean to keep from stepping on insects and killing them
2774954 early in the morning and in the evening the monks meet together for meditation and recitation after the ceremonies called
2774955 sometimes when the monks are walking in the jungle they sense tigers following them but since they hold the precept of no killing theyre not afraid and the tigers know they will not be harmed
2774956 our temple is very colorful it is decorated with many kinds of buddha images and wall hangings called
2774957 to us tibetans buddhism is a happy religion my favorite days are the festivals people in masks and costumes act out dramas about the life of the buddha bright new prayer flags are hung on these days they blow in the wind along the hillsides and remind us to live in harmony with nature now that your visit is over may you go with the spirit of the buddha
2774958 we chant namo amida butsu to show our gratitude to amida buddha the buddha of infinite light
2774959 the city of ten thousand buddhas is a buddhist community where people from all over the world come to study buddhism
2774960 a day at the temple begins at 4 00 a
2774961 everyone goes to work or school at 8 00 in the morning
2774962 i have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete

2774965 in him jesus we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished upon us
2774966 for those who love god all things work together for good for those who are called according to his purpose
2774967 iniziale stata una settimana bellissima e proprio quando ci eravamo abituati alla zona ai sassi agli
2774968 al dialetto tipico e a tutto il resto siamo dovuti partire il viaggio stata la parte pi tragica della vacanza soprattutto perch avevo un trolley che pesava praticamente 50 quintali e dire che ho usato a malapena la met dei vestiti che ho messo in valigia poveri i ragazzi che ahim sono state un po le nostre vittime perch ovviamente non solo hanno dovuto preoccuparsi delle loro valigie leggerissime tra laltro ma anche delle nostre

2774973 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2774974 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2774975 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2774976 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2774977 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2774978 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2774979 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2774980 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2774981 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2774982 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2774983 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2774984 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2774985 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2774986 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2774987 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2774988 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2774989 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
2774990 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve

2775030 well one of them had just given me the usual slam the money down on the counter and spit in your face routine
2775031 well it was just then that i looked up and he was standing there he didnt judge me he didnt look through me or wrinkle his nose at me he told me that god loved me that in spite of everything that ive done and been through god had sent him to me and then jesus the great famous healing teacher said that he chose me to join his inner circle no one has wanted me around for years and now the most righteous man ive ever known singled me out he told me it didnt matter what happened before he said that what happened was in the past and that from now on he was going to protect me that he would even die for me
2775032 id give anything for a man to say that to me and not want something in return

2775057 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand

2775085 id like to invite you to visualise yourself walking down totnes high street in a future totnes a future which has successfully navigated the energy descent transition as you walk along look around you who are you what are you doing look at the shop fronts and the buildings what has changed what are the businesses you see sniff the air how does it smell what did you have for breakfast where do you get your food from who else is walking with you are there children there who cares for them who teaches them so they know what they need to know are there old people who cares for them how do they share their wisdom what kind of work do you do in this future what are your rituals and celebrations imagine someone coming towards you someone from this future time you sense they have a lot of knowledge wisdom and memory what do they look like for you they have the knowledge and the memory of how this transition came to be talk and listen to them maybe you have some questions for them maybe they have some advice for you here she left a gap for people to reflect on this know that you may not get all the answers this second but you can invite this future to inform your dreams your choices and allow it to inform your bringing this future into being now as you start to leave you walk back up the high street and as you walk notice what you pass what has changed and what remains the same bring that memory and that vision with you so that we can create the deep knowing that it is possible and that you have an important role to place

2775090 the global economy is facing a triple crunch it is a combination of a credit fuelled financial crisis accelerating climate change and soaring energy prices underpinned by an encroaching peak in oil production these three overlapping events threaten to develop into a perfect storm the like of which has not been seen since the great depression to help prevent this from happening we are proposing a green new deal
2775091 yes but were not having a wake up call were having a witch hunt for who got us here
2775092 a run on the banks so fast your eyes would spin this is when everyone tops up their tank we havent run out of oil but we could literally run out of usable diesel and gasoline and then we would have the great american disaster because within a week wed have run out of food
2775093 start living in villages again eliminate long distance communiting by liberating the workforce and paying by productivity and growing food locally and starting to embrace an enormous amount of r amp d into things were not really doing anything about today likek ocean energy geothermal then within 5 7 we could get ourselves out of a very deep hole but we have to do it real quick
2775094 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2775095 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2775096 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2775097 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2775098 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2775099 girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich
2775100 not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2775101 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2775102 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2775103 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2775104 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2775105 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2775106 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2775107 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2775108 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2775109 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

2775189 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2775190 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2775191 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2775192 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2775193 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2775194 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
2775195 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2775196 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2775197 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2775198 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2775199 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2775200 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2775201 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2775202 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2775203 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2775204 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2775205 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
2775206 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
2775207 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
2775208 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
2775209 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
2775210 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
2775211 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
2775212 we had to work no matter how hot it was no matter how much it rained from 5 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon sometimes we could only afford rice porridge
2775213 its my destiny to be poor if i had another daughter id ask her to marry a foreigner
2775214 taiwanese women want to get married when they are much older and they are also very opinionated
2775215 no one ever came on our trip without finding their dream bride
2775216 they take hundreds of women at a time to a hotel and line them up for the men
2775217 there wont be anyone left for us marriage shouldnt be about money it should be about love
2775218 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2775219 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2775220 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2775221 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2775222 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2775223 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2775224 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2775225 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2775226 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2775227 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2775228 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2775229 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2775230 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2775231 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2775232 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2775233 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2775234 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2775235 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2775236 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2775237 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2775238 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2775239 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2775240 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2775241 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2775242 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2775243 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2775244 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2775245 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2775246 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2775247 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2775248 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2775249 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2775250 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2775251 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2775252 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2775253 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2775254 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2775255 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2775256 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2775257 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2775258 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2775259 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2775260 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2775261 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2775262 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2775263 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2775264 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2775265 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2775266 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2775267 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2775268 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
2775269 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

2775318 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
2775319 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2775320 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2775321 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2775322 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2775323 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2775324 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2775325 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2775326 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2775327 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2775328 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2775329 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2775330 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2775331 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2775332 who are open to doing something on the production side
2775333 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2775334 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2775335 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2775336 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
2775337 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2775338 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2775339 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2775340 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2775341 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2775342 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2775343 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2775344 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2775345 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2775346 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2775347 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2775348 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2775349 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2775350 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2775351 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2775352 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2775353 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2775354 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2775355 cest le plus beau jour de ma vie jai r alis un r ve denfant

2775358 l p e est depuis dans lombre du sabre et du fleuret mais jesp re que ce titre va attirer lattention sur nous il y a une flop e de jeunes qui poussent derri re
2775359 no not really but now i have to just sit and wait back at the athletes village
2775360 i just said oh my god oh my god over and over
2775361 im an ex nurse so i knew what could go wrong
2775362 they told me i would die before my kidneys gave out
2775363 i didnt think about it i just got on with life
2775364 like when i pulled the needle out and the blood went everywhere
2775365 ngai tahu met our needs in terms of quantity for future growth a central location and a good mix of corporate tenants
2775366 the new premises support our growth aspirations for our queenstown office and are a positive addition to the central business district
2775367 good working conditions are key in attracting good quality professional staff to the area
2775368 an all weather public piazza beside horne creek will create a thoroughfare of outdoor seating plantings and verandas between camp ballarat and stanley sts
2775369 were not looking for another bar but a cafe that can deal with morning noon and evening parts
2775370 we havent tried to create a glass precinct its all sympathetic to the existing buildings
2775371 we think theyve done a fantastic job on the site and look forward to continuing the relationship
2775372 on completion the building is anticipated to be equivalent to a four star rating
2775373 the main point is that although there are fears that new zealand may be entering a recession it is not all doom and gloom particularly if we look at the relatively strong performances of companies such as pgg wrightson nz farming systems uruguay and cavotec msl holdings
2775374 the south island has some companies particularly in the primary sector that are continuing to buck the downward trend of the market
2775375 where people have been for want of a better term breeding for a business
2775376 people have got to think twice before they hop into their car and be thinking ice ice ice extreme care should be taken especially at intersections and in shaded areas
2775377 unless we do something differently we will not be able to live within the funding
2775378 when i look back it is clear that my employment by general motors in the us in the 1960s was the defining event of my working life
2775379 i enjoyed the opportunity as a director to get away from the university scene and to obtain a better understanding of new zealand industry and commerce
2775380 this will not only have a huge impact on the level of care available but will also affect the ability of the academic sector to train new doctors
2775381 we hope there is a ground swell and the site creates some interest it is almost a criminal waste to see a victorian era tunnel sitting there disused the response has been encouraging and the majority of respondents think its a brilliant idea
2775382 we were astonished when i later heard they were 600 000 to 850 000
2775383 we would have to consider the practicalities and cost would be a driver its a wonderful asset but in its current form the tunnel is only being used for services the potential exists for it to be used in other ways which is wonderful for the city but as i say it comes down to practicality and further investigation would be needed
2775384 we walked 100m and no further with a gas monitor and it certainly was active it indicated it was not good idea to stay in there for too long underfoot the floor was very wet and boggy
2775385 in its current form its not a place one would want to go in running shoes
2775386 probably the big issue is the development of green standards
2775387 weve experienced that developers across new zealand want leading edge and future proof buildings that are also environmentally conscious
2775388 the codes and standards are in a state of transition and difficult for people to understand and sometimes its difficult for consent authorities to keep up
2775389 a developer will say i want to do a green development and its wide open for opportunities
2775390 the government wants wind power theyve set a target of 90 of our electricity from renewable sources by 2025 and we have 60 from hydro and some geothermal already
2775391 it puts the challenge to wind to make up the difference
2775392 however theres resistance on a local level and i dwelt on the visual landscape noise and ecological impacts in my presentation
2775393 sustainability is something were all affected by and as a socially responsible company we want to work with clients to devise sustainable solutions
2775394 it lives what it preaches and the lessons weve learned are applicable anywhere

2775457 they were holed up in their snow cave mr holden was obviously in pain but we literally dragged him out to the helicopter and he was quite happy
2775458 he had only been given some paracetamol by his companion so it was quite surprising

2775470 i was just asleep and it was a huge explosion and i thought it was thunderstorm
2775471 it was absolutely a huge explosion actually a number of explosions
2775472 theyre evacuating the area so i think theyre worried about another explosion
2775473 maybe theyre worried something on site is going to blow and if it is it may be bigger than what was there already so theyre being extra careful
2775474 other than this one individual we have not transported anyone else its people we have treated for minor cuts and bruises we have notified all the area hospitals so they are on standby they are aware that they could be having an influx of patients and many people will choose to go to the hospital on their own
2775475 its a pretty large fire looks like a seven alarm fire and its still burning

2775524 the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason to such a man the world tends to become definite finite obvious common objects rouse no questions and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected as soon as we begin to philosophize we find that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given

2775550 promoted racial ethnic and other subnational cultural identities and groupings
2775551 the ontological development of the unity of true knowledge and the powerful body along with the absolute construction of singular and collective immanence
2775552 conditioned by nature so as to live and act in a given way
2775553 every individual has sovereign right to do all that he can in other words the rights of an individual extend to the utmost limits of his power as it has been conditioned now it is the sovereign law and right of nature that each individual should endeavor to preserve itself as it is
2775554 every natural thing has by nature as much right as it has power to exist and operate
2775555 if they are to enjoy as a whole the rights which naturally belong to them as individuals
2775556 no one transfers his natural right so absolutely that he has no further voice in affairs he only hands it over to the majority of society whereof he is a unit thus all men remain as they were in a state of nature equals
2775557 in a free state everyone is permitted to think what he wishes and to say what he thinks
2775558 men have never surrendered their right and transferred their power to others so completely that they ceased to be feared by the very rulers who received their right and power and although deprived of their natural right became less dangerous to the state as citizens than its external enemies
2775559 consulting the public good and acting according to the dictates of reason
2775560 to defend the possession of the lands they inhabit and cultivate to protect themselves to repel all violence and to live according to the general judgment of all
2775561 the conjunctural agreement of complex elements that defines the specific character or complexion of an individual spinoza emphasizes the latin term ingenium is found on a larger scale in the collective forms of human existence couples masses nations all have a specific ingenium that makes themn what they are and no other
2775562 whatever so disposes the human body that it can be affected in a great many ways or renders it capable of affecting external bodies in a great many ways is useful to man the more it renders the body capable of being affected in a great many ways or of affecting other bodies the more useful it is on the other hand what renders the body less capable of these things is harmful
2775563 the real disturbers of the peace are those who in a free state seek to curtail the liberty of judgment which they are unable to tyrannize over
2775564 all collectivities into individual elements and making an individual the incarnation of universal human nature
2775565 since it is not the motive for obedience which makes a man a subject but the will to obey
2775566 obedience is less a matter of the outward action than of the minds inner activity so that the man who wholeheartedly decides to obey all the commands of another is most completely under his rule and in consequence he who rules in the hearts of the subjects holds sovereignty as much as possible
2775567 i sometimes felt like i must have made a mistake and should not have come to america in 1964 for my ph d i must have done something terrible to have ended up like this as i sat in jail i had to conclude that no matter how smart you are no matter how hard you work a chinese person an asian person like me will never be accepted we always will be foreigners

2775615 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2775616 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2775617 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2775618 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2775619 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2775620 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2775621 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2775622 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2775623 i have always said that i am very happy at chelsea

2775629 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
2775630 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
2775631 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
2775632 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
2775633 it concerns not only georgia it concerns the u s and its values we are a freedom loving country which is being attacked
2775634 we ask our friends including the u s to be mediators and try persuading russia to stop this military aggression and incursion into georgia
2775635 it is the third genocide of the ossetian people from the side of georgia and saakashvili is the main murderer
2775636 irrespective of the development of situation in south ossetia we wont stop moving to the border with georgia today they launch a military aggression against south ossetia and tomorrow it could be abkhazia it cannot go on like that
2775637 we are extremely concerned with the latest developments and we think that it is very regrettable that there has been loss of lives the most urgent thing at the moment is to calm the situation down
2775638 we left our town because the situation there is worse than anything ive seen in 18 years of conflict houses are being hit by rockets and heavy artillery aircraft are bombing the roads
2775639 over 1 000 civilians have been killed as the result of an attack by georgia on the capital of its breakaway republic of south ossetia the north ossetian nationalities minister said friday according to the south ossetian information and press committee the number of fatalities is estimated according to preliminary information at over 1 000
2775640 incidentally just so that this point isnt lost in the deliberately confusing reportage
2775641 one of the most indefensible things the bush administration has done in the last few years

2775664 clinton began to grow angry according to a participants notes
2775665 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself she snapped and hung up
2775666 the backstabbing and conflicting strategies that produced an epic meltdown
2775667 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2775668 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2775669 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2775670 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2775671 i dont mean to be an asshole but changes to important statements and other critical campaign communications simply have to go through howard
2775672 howard is the person who is ultimately responsibility for making sure that we deliver our messages the right way and i hope everyone will support and respect him in that role
2775673 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable after this campaign is over there will be plenty of time to access blame or claim credit
2775674 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
2775675 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
2775676 assuming after iowa and new hampshire the presidential nominating contest narrows to two competitive candidates who remain locked in a highly contested election through 5 february the focus of the campaign will shift to the delegate count
2775677 when the house is on fire its better to have a psychotic fireman than no fireman at all
2775678 the internal discord over whether to attack obama led some of her own staff to spin reporters to try to downplay the significance of her criticisms the result for clinton was the worst of both worlds the conflicting message exacerbated her reputation for negativity without affording her whatever benefits a sustained attack might have yielded
2775679 in the days leading up to ohio and texas the campaign kept arguing over whether to air the 3 a m ad with the deadline looming
2775680 on feb 25 a pair of clinton advisers began sending a series of increasingly urgent memos which were given to me by a recipient sympathetic to solis doyle as a way of illustrating that strategic mistakes continued even after her dismissal announced feb 10 the first memo from philippe reines and andrew shapiro worried that clintons anticipated wins in texas and ohio on march 4 would not meaningfully narrow obamas delegate lead a fact sure to sap momentum once the initial excitement of victory passed
2775681 they proposed that clinton from a position of strength immediately after her wins challenge obama to accept michigan and florida revotes such a move preempts obamas reiteration on march 5 that they are still up 100 plus delegates and that we cant win they noted the press will love the rematch like rocky ii
2775682 flights have in fact begun today and georgian forces are redeploying
2775683 we are supporting the georgian military units that are in iraq in their redeployment to georgia so that they can support requirements there during the current security situation
2775684 we had already been shuffling forces around in wassit province before the recent events so despite the loss of the georgian units although unexpected we can and are accommodating the changes

2775705 arrrr weve stripped out all the protection so you can now put a copy of this on yer hard disk and make easy backups
2775706 when you heard me mention to governor richardson the obama campaign attack against senator mccain when it comes to the russia georgia crisis i want to now read you comments from the mccain campaign against senator obama the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis though at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt really raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them ill put it to you i didnt really get an answer out of governor richardson but ill put it to you is that really an appropriate response to a crisis this severe
2775707 well you know senator mccain first went to georgia back in 1997
2775708 i think during these kinds of uncertain times you want somebody with senator mccains record of bringing real leadership real reform to washington
2775709 so when it comes to the georgia crisis i think this is another good reason why the american voters are going to choose senator mccains leadership not just political rhetoric you know senator obama condemned the violence and thats a good thing but we need to go beyond condemning the violence and actually offer solutions
2775710 so you dont think that senator obama is echoing the kremlin and has views that are bizarrely in sync with moscow is it fair to say you dont share that
2775711 i agree with what you asked governor richardson i think it was wrong for senator obama to try to focus on a mccain adviser rather than actually listening to what mccain had to say about the policy rather than recognizing mccains years and years of experience when comes to international affairs you know this is a very serious international crisis i think the administration has correctly sent word to moscow this is not acceptable georgia is a stalwart ally of ours as you noted theyve sent troops to iraq theyre applying for membership to nato nato has indicated that they would like them to become a member theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world theres a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue no t trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2775712 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2775713 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior

2775743 i wanted to make it my main focus so i could concentrate on doing quality work and i find now that many of my bird jobs consist of fixing other companies mistakes
2775744 the low profile of the system meant that it wouldnt interfere with the buildings aesthetics
2775745 plus the electric charge leaves more of a longer lasting psychological effect on the birds than other types of deterrents theyre less likely to return
2775746 we let the glue dry overnight then the next day we used screws on the flat edges of the roof for the track
2775747 ive had really good luck with the hard wired units
2775748 a pest management firm referred us to a five story building in palm beach county on the island
2775749 the buildings residents were beginning to complain of mites stemming from a major starling problem
2775750 they didnt want us to use net at first because they were worried about aesthetics
2775751 but we put up a sample for them and they realized they couldnt see it from the street the sample made the sale
2775752 when we were done with the installation they were complaining that they didnt think we did anything because they couldnt see it

2775755 however i believe that there is a wide range of diseases currently carried by pest birds that pose a serious and more immediate threat to human health
2775756 birds like rooftops and parapet walls because they provide a good lookout spot for food and predators

2775772 the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines saakashvili need only back away from this plan for moscow to ditch the two provinces revolt against tbilisi as long as he sticks to his guns south ossetia and abkhazia will wage separatist wars

2775895 youre going to miss the slow times and quiet days denise your anonymity stealth and small circle of friends plodding along at your own pace working in spurts and wondering where your next break will come from even your uncertainties doubts and fears will be missed it just works like that once massive dreams start coming true youll manage just fine

2775917 its easy now to pretend that the surge and its success was inevitable
2775918 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of the
2775919 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2775920 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2775921 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2775922 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2775923 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2775924 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2775925 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2775926 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2775927 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2775928 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2775929 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2775930 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2775931 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2775932 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2775933 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2775934 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2775935 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2775936 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2775937 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2775938 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2775939 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2775940 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2775941 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2775942 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2775943 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2775944 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2775945 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2775946 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2775947 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2775948 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2775949 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2775950 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2775951 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2775952 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2775953 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2775954 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2775955 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2775956 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2775957 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2775958 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2775959 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2775960 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2775961 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2775962 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2775963 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2775964 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2775965 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2775966 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2775967 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2775968 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2775969 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2775970 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2775971 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2775972 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2775973 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2775974 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2775975 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2775976 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2775977 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2775978 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2775979 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2775980 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2775981 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2775982 people have been ringing us in great distress the mood among them is dismal as they are looking at massive pay cuts all sorts of human tragedies are waiting to happen
2775983 there had been no previous public announcement from anybody even council leader bob bibby hasnt said a word the way it was done has created the damage the cruel blow was sending out the letters on a saturday when people were away from their work and unable to talk to colleagues
2775984 one lady who lives on her own got the letter looked at it and left it unopened until she returned to work on monday
2775985 i believe that a staff member at a council depot in bradley fold collapsed after suffering a panic attack and that an ambulance was called all the welfare issues associated with such an announcement have not been addressed
2775986 the letter which dropped through my door stated that my pay is to be cut from 17 000 to 12 000
2775987 all of my colleagues that i have been in contact with have had a pay cut ranging from 2 000 to 7 000 and none of us earns more than 18 000 and we are all women so i would like to know who the 42 per cent are that have had an increase it is certainly not us is it their managers
2775988 in the present climate to give staff this kind of pay cut is disgraceful fuel bills are expected to increase by 35 per cent and food and petrol bills are also rising so why are the council reducing the workers wages by up to 40 per cent
2775989 some council workers have stayed the same and some have had cuts of up to 40 per cent i suspect there will be a mass exodus from bury council and envisage the same from unison if we dont fight this disgraceful turn of events
2775990 as a result of job evaluation 70 per cent of the workforce will either benefit or be paid the same as a result of the proposals
2775991 bury is the first council in greater manchester to announce its actual pay scales it is distressing that some people will be financially disadvantaged but we are legally bound to address the disparity of salaries
2775992 70 per cent of the workforce will either benefit or be paid the same as a result of the proposals
2775993 just pay up your subs to support virtually everybody else theres a good chap
2775994 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2775995 the ability to get things done here is really staggering in los angeles it would take endless discussions to build any structure here they decide to do it and kaboom it happens
2775996 shanghais deputy mayor told me that as his city became more polluted the government simply moved thousands of small manufacturers out of shanghai to clean up the air at this time when democracies like india and america seem incapable of making hard decisions i cannot help but feel a tinge of jealousy at chinas ability to be serious about its problems and actually do things that are tough and require taking things away from people
2775997 from what ive been told from the hotel the public security bureau showed up at midnight and told them our specific event had to be canceled for safety reasons without going into any specifics
2775998 when i arrived at 8 a m there were public security officials in the press conference room we had booked
2775999 nu ne g ndim cum vor evolua fotbali tii care au venit de la dinamo n acest meci vor juca fotbali tii care sunt n form i care merit s evolueze cred c juc torii veni i de la dinamo sunt profesioni ti i i doresc s dovedeasc faptul c au valoare n meciul sta ei vor juca pentru otopeni nu le interzic s fie suporterii clubului de unde au venit aici nsa vreau ca n acest meci s fie cu noi pot conta pe fotbali tii veni i de la dinamo

2776005 what is the worst outcome that could come from this decision
2776006 city turns into human hell many people still trapped under rubble
2776007 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2776008 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2776009 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children
2776010 we are not going to undertake any actions which are going to lead to escalation of the situation in this region
2776011 now some people would be worried about this display of strength now some people might note that the inclusion of martial artists is somewhat threatening now some people might feel funny about how we are weak and they are strong
2776012 we found that there was underpayment of prevailing wages and supplements
2776013 we have set a standard now and there are no excuses for not getting back to that level again
2776014 i guess it has given us confidence there is a bit of belief there and we have put the line in the sand now
2776015 i guess we have to make sure regardless of what got us to perform that week we have to make sure we get to that point again
2776016 its a hell of a challenge over here but its something the guys get excited about the challenge of facing this pack over here they are a hell of a good tight five and loose forwards is going to be big for us
2776017 you have to get parity up front the springboks they get on top of you over here and they are a bloody hard thing to stop
2776018 then again whos going to burn what you can archive to hdd arrays

2776035 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
2776036 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
2776037 we demand freedom and democracy for citizens of both countries today and not tomorrow
2776038 we shall accordingly continue to pile on pressure until a settlement is reached that is based on our demands
2776039 we want a total isolation of mugabe and his cronies

2776052 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2776053 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2776054 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2776055 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2776056 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2776057 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2776058 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2776059 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2776060 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2776061 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2776062 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2776063 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2776064 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2776065 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2776066 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities

2776069 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2776070 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2776071 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2776072 decisions about these products ought to be evaluated through a more rigorous scientific process than debated in legislatures
2776073 the assertion is somehow were going to ban some material thats going to keep food fresh and safe thats a terrible thing to say and its not true
2776074 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2776075 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2776076 in fact banks that have shares traded on the stock market are public companies they are officially permitted by the securities law to buy back shares
2776077 the stock market now is governed by investor sentiment which is quite sensitive to any news however small how well the market fares depends partially on this news

2776099 i had started doing country been listening to country i found it a little boring vocally but i liked the writing
2776100 it was more challenging vocally but that wasnt really me either
2776101 i came back and on this album it takes the country writing the stories and the rock vibe but keeps that soul edge to it
2776102 my music isnt really that country its just country enough it can be played on pop and country stations alike

2776214 danny atar and kaddoura mousa two relatively unknown people have made great strides on the road to peace and could go much further if their governments would only stop interfering
2776215 in the movie both katrina kaif and akshay kumar have entertained us the like shahrukh khan and deepika padukone did in
2776216 pritams music is mind blowing too its going to be a big musical hit of the year

2776220 when prime minister manmohan singh won confidence vote in parliament news channels called him sinngh is king it feels good that movie makers are coming up with the innovative ideas and titles
2776221 aamir on the other hand knows his limitations and tries to select better scripts rather than the ones which allow did you like the film was the theatre full
2776222 the piece can be dismissed as a conspiracy theory of my cynical mind

2776244 awak mesti balik untuk tunaikan janji awak nak buat majlis yang awak cakapkan di dalam salah satu surat awak
2776245 this reunion is a good way to get the word out
2776246 since we started fundraising in early spring weve hit about 1 percent of what we need
2776247 the girls used to all meet in the basement of the old school and pierce each others ears
2776248 i still picture her as the girl i used to sit for
2776249 i remember all of us having to climb out a window when we got locked in a bedroom years ago
2776250 seeing all the younger graduates does make me feel a little old
2776251 but i have seen people i hadnt seen in years like one young man who used to be a boy scout in my troop
2776252 at a regular one class reunion you dont connect with those who graduated before or after you
2776253 and bacon academy has always been the center of life in colchester the school is the heart of town
2776254 i decided to forget that i hit the ball in the water sorenstam said
2776255 i enjoyed seeing the fans making the wave and applauding when i went up to the green it felt really good
2776256 i never thought i could win the tournament said yang who accepted the trophy and a hug from sorenstam
2776257 the leader was four shots ahead of me so i thought id just go out and have fun im very happy
2776258 before the tournament i wanted annika to win it shes my favorite player
2776259 naturally it was special to walk out there today sorenstam said
2776260 i knew this was my last tournament in sweden im enormously thankful for the fans support this week
2776261 we are examining our curriculum and how we could best change it to help our students reach proficiency
2776262 we dont want to just make proficiency we want to make goal
2776263 it may need to be tweaked in some areas to help students
2776264 nagging complaints about some generic drugs are casting doubt on one of medicines most widely held assumptions that generics are just as good as brand name versions only cheaper
2776265 cette situation absurde d montre que ce sont les pouvoirs publics qui asservissent les sans papiers ceux l m me qui nous accusent dincitation l meute sont ceux qui favorisent lappel dair nous navons pas de le on recevoir deux
2776266 ce nouvel pisode illustre labsurdit de la politique migratoire du gouvernement qui criminalise des trangers int gr s qui gagnent dignement leur vie dans des secteurs o ils sont indispensables
2776267 even if youve never done any sports before you can start now
2776268 whats the worst that can happen you fail try something else
2776269 its to raise money and raise awareness to the gifts and talents of people with disabilities and what they have to offer their community
2776270 it tastes excellent not unlike venison only a different flavour
2776271 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2776272 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2776273 ten years ago there was a lot of drugs here now theres barely nothing
2776274 ive seen a steady use and sale of it the last six or seven years
2776275 its sales of medium quantities of course were always seeing the use of it
2776276 weve looked at different ways to do something like this
2776277 i think its the right way to go because for the first time it involves the community to this point there was a perception that any substance problem is the polices problem or a schools problem its not its a community problem
2776278 its got all the elements in it just on a smaller scale
2776279 it puts the whole community together in a coalition to fight this stuff
2776280 and if they see someones setting up they can alert someone else itll give us that extra day or couple of days to start on an operation
2776281 eventually it will work because well influence other kids to join and make smart decisions
2776282 i think kids at this point the scope of use has changed
2776283 a lot of them dont even consider marijuana a drug anymore alcohol has always been a problem
2776284 its smoking and drinking a couple people do coke theres probably like three people that dont do anything
2776285 its not going to work everybodys tried at least one drug
2776286 as far as kids you do the best you can as a parent and then send them out the door and keep your fingers crossed
2776287 youre going to have a group of kids you hate to say that are predestined theyre not going to make good decisions i think any program even if it helps a few of those kids is a good thing
2776288 three years ago there were people and kids running around getting stupid all the time a lot of it has cut back
2776289 i dont think its a matter of the town having this program and trying to make it work
2776290 what it really boils down to is the people in town the program sounds great but anyone who likes the program will support it and everyone who doesnt is going to neglect it and hate it
2776291 you try to grow up your kids the best you can what they do after they do
2776292 most of its done at night when the kids are all in bed i dont like it but theres nothing we can do about it
2776293 as my kids get older i have to let them have more responsibility thats when they have to make a decision
2776294 im hoping that being in a community like this this will make them think twice you have to hope this is going to make a positive difference
2776295 if all the sectors in putnam come together and they start putting all the pieces together then yes it can work
2776296 research shows it can work they can be a leader for other communities and i think theyve got a really great chance at this point
2776297 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2776298 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2776299 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2776300 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2776301 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2776302 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2776303 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2776304 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2776305 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2776306 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2776307 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2776308 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2776309 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2776310 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2776311 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2776312 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2776313 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2776314 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2776315 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2776316 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2776317 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2776318 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2776319 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2776320 the safest possible conditions for children staff and visitors than as a weapon
2776321 i think parents need to realize theyre not zapping kids for not having a hall pass
2776322 the key is conservative use i think we can say if we can break up a fight in the hallway in a traditional way then whats the point of a taser
2776323 probably the majority of my concern is protecting staff and students from something that could happen from outside the school you want to be prepared if youre not its too late
2776324 i think if the guys trained and qualified its definitely a plus you never know anymore common sense is the biggest thing
2776325 some people make me look bad some people make me look disappointed some people make me think about what we have some players should look themselves in the mirror and be embarrassed and they should be better thats all i can say
2776326 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2776327 the main source of support for the u s economy in recent quarters has been the strength of net exports
2776328 but the world economy has fallen off the edge of a cliff
2776329 i think they are all homosexual communists in satans army i espect as well they all live together and bathe together every morning and have the anal sex with one another with the fisting and the guinea pigs
2776330 i can never quite tell if the defeatists are conservative satirists poking fun at the left or simply retards or both retarded satire perhaps
2776331 you two the rev and el comandante make an erudite pair i guess it beats thinking
2776332 its hard for us to understand what the russian plan is
2776333 people can argue back and forth over who shot first
2776334 lets face it this particular resolution was unachievable unreachable and unreasonable
2776335 character is the ability to carry out a good resolution long after the excitement of the moment has passed

2776367 flights have in fact begun today and georgian forces are redeploying

2776369 we had already been shuffling forces around in wassit province before the recent events so despite the loss of the georgian units although unexpected we can and are accommodating the changes

2776380 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2776381 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2776382 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2776383 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2776384 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2776385 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2776386 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2776387 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2776388 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2776389 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2776390 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2776391 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2776392 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease
2776393 its crap no production value just some schmo with a camcorder and kids doing stupid stuff

2776396 you cant offer a first year college undergrad facing huge student loans 25 000 and expect her to really contemplate the risks
2776397 and what will happen later if they have difficulty conceiving a child after theyve donated their eggs to science instead of saving them for themselves
2776398 the idea is that if a woman is paid enough theres a point at which she may not pay attention to the risks
2776399 the consensus has pretty much been to err on the side of caution
2776400 i think its outrageous that anyone would tell a woman she cant make her own decision
2776401 embryonic stem cell research is where weve made the most headway
2776402 we shouldnt just jump out on another limb without very good reason
2776403 i dont see how they would expect any woman to do it without getting paid for it
2776404 one of my men was killed on the spot when the taliban attacked us while four went missing the rest of us laid down our arms and were captured
2776405 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2776406 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2776407 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
2776408 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
2776409 ive had two bikes stolen so i stopped buying bikes because they kept stealing them

2776437 kami berdua datang ke sini untuk memberikan kekuatan dan dorongan moral buat dia biar dia tahu banyak orang care sama dia
2776438 dia akui kesalahan yang telah dilakukan apa yang dilakukan akan dia pertanggungjawabkan
2776439 let me start by saying that i am neither city or spurs but i do know a little about what is happening with corluka due to a business interest
2776440 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
2776441 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
2776442 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
2776443 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
2776444 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
2776445 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
2776446 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
2776447 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
2776448 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
2776449 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
2776450 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
2776451 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
2776452 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
2776453 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
2776454 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
2776455 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
2776456 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
2776457 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
2776458 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
2776459 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
2776460 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
2776461 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
2776462 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
2776463 my guess is that while this curtailed naked short selling in the short run i suspect people found clever and sophisticated ways to work around it through derivatives
2776464 if the sec removes the rule it will give the short sellers the edge in the market they are looking for
2776465 step up and do the right thing for their investors

2776476 seems to have been the last moment in american history when the country might have changed in a fundamental way for the better
2776477 like a rolling stone even more tragic if michael pisaro is right
2776478 a few days ago we received an invitation from arab parliamentarians to travel to arab countries but we were surprised when the egyptian authorities refused to give us permission to leave the gaza strip
2776479 today we wanted to send a message to the egyptian and arab leaderships about the need to end the siege against 1 5 million palestinians
2776480 those who are refusing to lift the siege are actually taking part in the siege against the palestinians
2776481 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2776482 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2776483 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2776484 im not entirely clear on how this works but ill give it a try
2776485 estamos muy satisfechos porque la gente va a votar y es muy importante porque no s lo va profundizar la democracia sino es la primera vez que la ciudadan a hace conocer su percepci n respecto a la gesti n de sus gobernantes
2776486 quedar a convocar a la ciudadan a a que hagan uso de su derecho soberano de decidir lo que se debe hacer en el pa s en pol tica y en labores
2776487 llamamos a todos los bolivianos a que acudan a las urnas y que ejerzan su derecho de ratificar o de revoca a sus autoridades tanto nacionales como departamentales para dejar un antecedente positivo en la historia

2776490 we will go back to the world as it was the day before cox testified that the emergency order was coming
2776491 our strategies remained pretty much the same what did change however was the level of compliance involved before making trades
2776492 before we can make a trade that involves short stock in those affected names we have to verify that the customer has pre borrowed the stock and then get confirmation from the firm that lent the stock this slows us down and eats up quite a bit of manpower that can be better used elsewhere
2776493 hoy la democracia se enriquece porque el ciudadano el votante no tiene que esperar cinco a os para someter a prueba a las principales autoridades del pa s para evaluar su gesti n
2776494 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2776495 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2776496 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2776497 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2776498 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2776499 im not entirely clear on how this works but ill give it a try

2776502 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2776503 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2776504 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2776505 it took leadership commitment to recognize that there is a distinct possibility that just because we have done it this way for 120 years doesnt mean that we continue to do it this way for the next 120 years there may be some alternatives to the way innovation and invention occurs
2776506 it is an interesting question because intelligence is at the heart of what we want to do which is how do you find archimedes as he sits in the tub and if we really knew exactly what the answer to that question was i probably wouldnt send the challenge out to 120 000 people i would just send it to archimedes as he was getting into the tub we are using brute force large numbers to substitute for his eureka moment if you just take the story at face value and i realize that is impossible to do but if you could reproduce the sitting in the bathtub part how could i ever build that into my r amp d function but if i go out to the large numbers of individuals in the crowd somebody is going to sit in their bathtub at the right point in time
2776507 t here are some things the crowd should never do the crowd cant tell you what your key r amp d objectives and strategies should be you could run a business in which you posted your current strategy and ask for input on it i am not arguing that when you look at an innocentive like system the crowd is good at solving problems but they are not necessarily good at asking questions asking questions is tied to things that are about your business strategy your product evolution and feedback from your customers
2776508 oh this is trivial and i can solve this using my own knowledge
2776509 we need to leverage this community not just to play off one another but actually in order to collaborate
2776510 only one of us could make it over the wall
2776511 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2776512 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2776513 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2776514 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2776515 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2776516 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2776517 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2776518 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2776519 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2776520 i should have known that people would feel that way
2776521 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2776522 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2776523 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2776524 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2776525 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
2776526 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
2776527 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
2776528 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
2776529 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2776530 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2776531 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2776532 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2776533 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2776534 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2776535 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2776536 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2776537 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2776538 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2776539 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
2776540 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2776541 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2776542 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2776543 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2776544 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2776545 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2776546 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2776547 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2776548 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2776549 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2776550 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2776551 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label
2776552 i just worked on ciaras album me and kanye did it again we did another hook like two days ago
2776553 i got two records with t pain that are retarded
2776554 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2776555 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2776556 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2776557 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2776558 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2776559 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2776560 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2776561 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2776562 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2776563 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2776564 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2776565 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2776566 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2776567 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2776568 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2776569 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2776570 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2776571 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2776572 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2776573 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2776574 despite having the second highest population in the world of which women constitute 50 percent the average representation of women in parliament is a dismal low of just 8 8 per cent
2776575 women in the country are discriminated against and are insecure and through this front we want to ensure that the issues of priority concerning half the countrys population come to the forefront in indias national agenda
2776576 if mothers ruled the world there would be no goddamn wars in the first place
2776577 wikileaks is developing an uncensorable wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis our primary interest is in exposing oppressive regimes in asia the former soviet bloc sub saharan africa and the middle east but we also expect to be of assistance to those in the west who wish to reveal unethical behavior in their own governments and corporations we aim for maximum political impact our interface is identical to wikipedia and usable by all types of people we have received over 1 2 million documents so far from dissident communities and anonymous sources
2776578 wikileaks looks like wikipedia anybody can post to it anybody can edit it no technical knowledge is required whistleblowers can post documents anonymously and untraceably users can publicly discuss documents and analyze their credibility and veracity users can discuss the latest material read and write explanatory articles on leaks along with background material and context the political relevance of documents and their veracity will be revealed by a cast of thousands
2776579 a corrupt or unethical corporation is a menace to all inside and outside it
2776580 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2776581 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2776582 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2776585 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2776586 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2776587 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2776588 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2776589 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2776590 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2776591 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2776592 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2776593 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2776594 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2776595 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2776596 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2776597 it means a lot you want to get off to a good start
2776598 but its really for fitness and the last game before the start of the season
2776599 writing novels to me is basically a kind of manual labor
2776600 most of what i know about writing fiction i learned from running every day
2776601 what did i do to make her think like that
2776602 cuando el hombre se aparta de dios no es dios quien le persigue sino los dolos
2776603 gratitud al se or que me ha concedido este descanso
2776604 dedic ndome a la oraci n a la lectura y a la meditaci n sin la premura de las cotidianas urgencias pastorales que ciertamente no he olvidado sino por as decir he filtrado mediante un sano desapego que ayuda a restablecer las justas proporciones reconocer que el se or es dios y nosotros somos solamente sus humildes colaboradores por el servicio de la iglesia y por el bien de la humanidad
2776605 disiparse en un vano perseguir ilusiones de placer pero de esta forma el esp ritu no descansa el coraz n no encuentra ni alegr a ni paz sino que termina por estar m s cansado y triste que antes me he referido a los j venes porque son los m s sedientos de vida y de experiencias nuevas y por ello quienes corren m s peligro
2776606 la reflexi n vale para todos la persona humana se regenera verdaderamente y solamente en la relaci n con dios y dios se encuentra aprendiendo a escuchar su voz en el interior y en el silencio
2776607 han causado muchas v ctimas inocentes y obligado a un gran n mero de civiles a dejar las propias casas
2776608 es mi vivo deseo que terminen inmediatamente las acciones militares y que no se den en nombre de la com n herencia cristiana ulteriores enfrentamientos y actos violentos que puedan degenerar en un conflicto de mayores magnitudes
2776609 el camino de la negociaci n y del dialogo respetuoso y constructivo evitando ulteriores sufrimientos a tan queridas poblaciones
2776610 la comunidad internacional y a los pa ses m s influyentes en la actual situaci n a realizar todo esfuerzo para sostener y promover iniciativas destinas a alcanzar una soluci n pac fica y duradera en favor de una convivencia abierta y respetuosa
2776611 junto a nuestros hermanos ortodoxos rezamos intensamente por estas intenciones y nos encomendamos confiados a la intercesi n de la sant sima virgen mar a madre de jes s y de todos los cristianos
2776612 la protecci n legal y constitucional para una definici n del matrimonio como la uni n de un hombre y una mujer y la exclusi n de cualquier otra forma
2776613 cualquier acci n o pol tica gubernamental que promueva el aborto la investigaci n con c lulas estaminales embrionarias la clonaci n humana la eutanasia el suicidio asistido y otras ofensas en contra de la vida
2776614 que son funcionarios p blicos que sean fieles a la fe que dicen profesar actuando valiente y p blicamente en defensa de la vida

2776774 oh look at you with it in your hair you dirty girl
2776775 ive been sitting here cant get you off my mind
2776776 oh chef can we have a food fight later please
2776777 without a serious understanding of the currents in my own nation and the way we impact the world there will be a hollowness to that spirituality
2776778 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2776779 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2776780 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2776781 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2776782 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2776783 girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich
2776784 not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2776785 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2776786 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2776787 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2776788 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2776789 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2776790 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2776791 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2776792 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2776793 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2776794 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2776795 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2776796 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2776797 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2776798 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2776799 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2776800 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2776801 the olympics are supposed to bring people together to peacefully blend and im looking forward to that and stepping on the track and wearing my colors and representing my country
2776802 nous avons choisi jackie parce quil est cest la star chinoise la plus connue linternational et aussi parce quil a beaucoup fait pour les jeux olympiques
2776803 were starting at 6 and going until the last person has a chance to speak
2776804 our primary interest is customer service and we want our management teams who attend commission meetings to be open to the public
2776805 some runners they always miss practice because its so early
2776806 i kind of missed some practice this week but you have to do it if you want to be faster you have to wake up and follow coach
2776807 its so early and im kind of lazy when its that early
2776808 during the day i have to do all sorts of stuff well have school soon i also work why would i want to wake up early when even the sun is almost down
2776809 we dont have that many athletes showing up because parents cant drop them off at that time and a lot of runners dont drive
2776810 and some of them just dont come to practice when its that early
2776811 we arent really that familiar with the gw area to be running in the dark and i think parents would like their kids to be at home at that time studying or eating dinner
2776812 we the department of public works and the guam public school system have worked day and night to ensure that the schools are ready for the opening on aug 12
2776813 in spite of those efforts however we have a number of schools that will not be ready for opening on aug 12
2776814 its just sad that it took all this time for them to take action and work on the infractions that the schools had and for this to happen for any school to not open on time is just preposterous its just ridiculous
2776815 its sad that they wait for it to happen now
2776816 we continue to appeal to the public at large to please provide assistance to the guam public school system by turning in your applications if you have a four year degree and you have a certificate or you have experience in teaching
2776817 injuries he suffered when his convoy vehicle hit an improvised explosive device while serving in sangatesh afghanistan
2776818 we extend our sympathies and prayers to his family friends and loved ones
2776819 anthony will rest in the hearts and minds of a grateful people who are humbled by his ultimate sacrifice
2776820 i have ordered all government agencies to fly all flags at half staff in honor of petty officer 2nd class anthony carbullido
2776821 he was a very funny guy always talking he was fun to be around
2776822 we took him and his wife around and had a good time
2776823 he was over there so we can have the way of life we always believed in
2776824 he was the kind of kid that always made the ultimate challenge and he made this ultimate challenge so we can have freedom anywhere in the world
2776825 ive seen past pictures and articles of troops who have died in combat and it scared me because my son is over there
2776826 its hard to believe that this is happening to us
2776827 guam needed a boutique where women can go and find something just for them
2776828 because were in the business of intimacy the name fit
2776829 about 70 percent of women wear the wrong bra size
2776830 thats the key to succeed when people dont monitor their expenses thats how a lot of businesses fail
2776831 it is very important for the kids get a nutritious breakfast in the morning
2776832 parents are responsible for their childs mind being ready to learn instead of having them feeling starved in the morning we need to make sure they are focused wide awake and stomachs ready to learn
2776833 it is very important for everyone to have a nutritious breakfast in order to function properly
2776834 having the children eat nutritious foods in the morning will enable their minds to be equipped with the maximum cognitive ability
2776835 kids who dont eat breakfast are less able to learn at school and get less iron in their diets
2776836 it is best for your child to go to bed at 8 or 9 p m with 9 being the absolute latest
2776837 parents need to make sure their kids wake up on time so they will be able to allot time for breakfast and getting ready during instruction we want to avoid the children being restless and that information being taught is learned and absorbed
2776838 sleep is an individual thing and some kids need more than others
2776839 i am honored to be a part of the history and legend of one of hockeys original six i hope keys to the city inspires some awesome fights on the ice

2776983 in that the aafd board of directors next meeting is set for september 4 2008 i am acting to immediately to suspend cuppys accredited contract status pending action of the aafd board i am causing this action to be published on the aafd website and to appropriate media all listings of cuppys coffee will forthwith be removed from the aafd website and we are instructing cuppys management to remove all references to the aafd from its website and franchise marketing literature
2776984 our purpose remains to inspire fair contracts and collaborative relationships and we are open to negotiating and mediating effective relief for all cuppys franchisees in a manner that will effect restitution from injuries and will allow cuppys coffee to achieve the corporate goals set by new management upon its acquisition of the company
2776985 the path to a successful resolution of the cuppys quagmire is through communication negotiation collaboration and if necessary mediation the path to certain destruction is to ignore the problem and face an inevitable and costly litigative path

2777017 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
2777018 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
2777019 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
2777020 we had to work no matter how hot it was no matter how much it rained from 5 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon sometimes we could only afford rice porridge

2777022 taiwanese women want to get married when they are much older and they are also very opinionated

2777032 we did all we could in a few moments to bring them together we could see some mistakes based on that but those routines are 100 percent ready physically to be done
2777033 weve overcome so many obstacles but we came out here today and showed the world and every team out here that we can come back strong

2777039 bisphenol a does not pose a risk to the general population including adults teenagers and children
2777040 if you continue to use polycarbonate baby bottles it is recommended that parents and caregivers do not put boiling water in them
2777041 these bottles can be sterilized according to instructions on infant formula labels and can be cleaned in the dishwasher they should be left to cool to room temperature before adding the infant formula
2777042 canned foods and into food in contact with pc table ware or storage receptacles
2777043 it is unlikely that humans including infants and young children are at risk from possible bpa exposure
2777044 exposure levels to bpa including exposure to infants and children are below those that may cause health effects
2777045 bisphenol a does not pose a risk to the general population including adults teenagers and children
2777046 would need to consume several hundred cans of food per day to reach the tolerable level established by health canada a tolerable daily intake is how much of a substance can be taken in on a daily basis over a lifetime without appreciable health risk
2777047 if opponents drive bpa out of the food supply consumers will pay some bpa free plastic bottles sell for 10 each more than twice the price of bottles with bpa baby bottles made of glass can break potentially causing injury replacing bpa in the lining of cans would mean retooling all that packaging and its not clear that there are safe alternatives
2777048 the amount of a controversial chemical bisphenol a bpa found in baby bottles is tiny and cannot harm human health the european unions top food safety body said on wednesday reacting to recent health concerns

2777089 yeah four shots of cod liver oil want another one
2777090 okay heres how it works youve got to eat the whole thing you cant throw up or you wont get the money
2777091 see those worms still wriggling around ill bet you 10 a worm if you eat them
2777092 no way everybody knows what theyre getting into everybody has a good time if somebody walks by and doesnt enjoy it hey its a free country just keep on walking man
2777093 spurlocks wisecracks make the statistic laden information easily digestible and possibly useful as a classroom text
2777094 according to studies conducted by the american cancer society more than 20 percent of all cancer deaths in women and 14 percent in men ar linked directly to being overweight another 33 percent of cancer deaths are linked to poor diet and physical inactivity thats a lot of people dying needlessly
2777095 people can die of cancer at 70 because they no longer die of malaria at 12
2777096 big gdp equals long life expectancy small gdp equals early death
2777097 a mcdonalds diet near 2 000 calories per day can include a double cheeseburger and fries for dinner although doing so would involve sacrificing both high calorie drinks and the trademark of supersizing his meal whenever offered spurlock intentionally avoided any physical activity during his mcdonalds diet almost to the point of absurdity
2777098 spurlock deliberately ate 5 000 calories per day more than twice whats recommended
2777099 spurlock intentionally avoided any physical activity during his mcdonalds diet almost to the point of absurdity
2777100 the smoking rate has declined faster among wealthier than among less affluent groups
2777101 fat is deadly obesity related illnesses will kill around 400 000 americans this year almost the same as smoking
2777102 and if you add in the lives saved by the protective effects of mild overweight the number is closer to 25 000
2777103 morgan spurlock watch said the figure was wrong but in fact it was right and the site was off by a factor of whatever in estimating deaths from obesity
2777104 since todays kids are maturing at earlier ages than kids of twenty or thirty years ago theyre naturally going to be heavier at earlier ages
2777105 there is no room for chicken in a healthy diet
2777106 i think that violence and nonviolence are not moral principles theyre tactics
2777107 if someone is killing on a regular basis thousands of animals and if that person can only be stopped in one way by the use of violence then it is certainly a morally justifiable solution
2777108 i think we do need to embrace direct action and violent tactics as part of our movement i dont think we ought to be criticizing someone whether were criticizing them because theyre writing letters or whether we criticize them because theyre burning down fur stores or vivisection labs i think we need to include everybody in that circle
2777109 the police are protecting the circus they are protecting the meat and dairy industry they are protecting the vivisection industry and i equate them in my own mind on a moral and ethical level with the no different than say guards in a nazi concentration camp
2777110 i dont have any doubt in my mind that there will come a time when we will see violence against animal rights abusers
2777111 according to the latest national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes total caloric intake by adults increased from 1 969 calories in 1978 to 2 200 in 1990
2777112 if eating 5000 calories of mcdonalds every day is extremely bad then eating mcdonalds once in a while must be somewhat bad
2777113 i exercised and ate less and lost 20 pounds that 400 pound man who whines about his genetic disorder could just do what i did for 10 times as long
2777114 on april 1 he began eating all his meals four or five per day at mcdonalds weaver ate upwards of 3 000 calories per day and after two weeks had lost eight pounds yes lost since he didnt particularly want to lose weight weaver then increased his food intake to about 5 000 calories per day and managed to gain back about two pounds by the end of the month his cholesterol improved his blood pressure dropped a bit and he says he feels just fine how did he do it weaver works out at a gym daily about an hour and fifteen minutes per day split between aerobic exercise and resistance training he was in good shape before he began his mcdiet and remained so throughout anyone who wishes to do so can check the numbers for themselves at his website www truthinfitness org its an impressive testimonial to the importance of staying physically active
2777115 super size me director and star morgan spurlock is being sued for a staggering 40 million by a company which claims hes failed to share the films profits with them despite signing a contract promising a 25 percent share
2777116 we bet on this long shot and it hit and theyre basically trying to keep all the money he is engaging in self interested and wasteful activities and diverting assets into a new company
2777117 i havent had the opportunity to read it but as reported to me the claim is baseless and without merit
2777118 it tastes kinda like meat but more like an industrialized meat flavored substitute
2777119 communes and luddite farms are fine so long as we approach them with the understanding that they are at heart parasitic
2777120 parasitic in that luddite farms do not produce many of the things if you are honest you find useful healthcare is the primary example i use the hippie farmer benefits from the big city doctor using big city surgical equipment and big city training to operate on his child if injured
2777121 a secondary example is national defense compare a self sufficient farm in vermont to a self sufficient farm in nairobi and youll get the idea now if you want to enjoy the lifestyle of a nairobi farmer youll likely have a harsh 30 year existence before you pass to the big pasture in the sky not the bucolic vermont hippie existence
2777122 a commune can support itself with few inputs from the outside but boyd is right absent a wealthy society the people living that way are doomed to a miserable but short life
2777123 britians mad cow epidemic will not may happen sometime soon in the us
2777124 while the above would also hold true for classical musicians and consultants in my experience those two categories of people do not exude the sheer self righteousness and moral superiority that spurlock and his dancing rabbit comrades do nor for that matter do musicians and consultants try to convert others to their lifestyle
2777125 finally if everyone lived on an eco commune how would they make money to buy photovoltaic cells you would have to produce a lot of surplus vegetables to purchase that sort of sophisticated equipment especially since everyone at every other commune grows and cells vegetables too thus depressing the price
2777126 they arent applicable in the macro that is if we all lived this way wed all starve
2777127 again why is this argument not applicable to any hyperbolically large group of homogenous people
2777128 the non hippy computer scientist however pays for the surgery out of his own pocket or pays indirectly via insurance premiums the hippy gets a free ride since the hospital is required to treat him regardless of ability to pay
2777129 communes and luddite farms are fine so long as we approach them with the understanding that they are at heart parasitic they may shun technology markets and commerce but technology markets and commerce make it possible for them to exist they arent applicable in the macro that is if we all lived this way wed all starve
2777130 stoutness once symbolic of plenty and success was increasingly viewed as a sign of excess ill health sloth and a lack of self control regulation of the body through houdini like stunts marathon fasts and bizarre dietary cults was a running theme of late victorian and early twentieth century life
2777131 overweight the key causes are increased consumption of energy dense foods high in saturated fats and sugars and reduced physical activity
2777132 obesity and overweight pose a major risk for chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease hypertension and stroke and certain forms of cancer
2777133 where exactly are these cheaper healthier alternatives you speak of i for one would love to see them
2777134 just please dont assume that theyre gourmet cooks and have hours to prepare every meal ok were talking about something you can grab in a 20 minute lunch break
2777135 127 different ways to eat a serving of fruits and vegetables for less than the price of a 3 ounce candy bar
2777136 researchers found that nearly two thirds of the fruits and vegetables studied were cheapest in their fresh form
2777137 doesnt the government count the potato as a vegetable isnt most of that increase probably due to french fries and potato chips
2777138 i cant imagine the margins on produce are very high even by big box standards so isnt the rest of the store subsidizing the produce section to some extent
2777139 however if were just looking at the goal of getting produce to urban customers assuming for the sake of argument that this needs to be done and its not happening because its not economically attractive enough then we are choosing between having a profits subsidize the produce department or subsidizing produce in some other way i dont know taxing mcdonalds more and giving a tax break to the veggie shop vendor or some similarly spurlockish scheme
2777140 if it doesnt pay wal mart to go into an area then it wont go there or it wont stay
2777141 this is a band with a deep sense of melody as well as a deep sense of songwriting throw some balls in for good measure and you get negative space
2777142 i think our material is able to connect with a lot of people musically and lyrically without being over the top were just pretty honest with our approach were not trying to fool anyone
2777143 its the type of live show that is better when youre in the front row
2777144 no one food item will meet all of the usdas suggestions
2777145 no one food item will meet all of the usdas suggestions
2777146 the usda suggestions are for a whole diet it doesnt work on a food by food basis that would be supid
2777147 you could have a big mac for lunch and real food the rest of the day and still hit the usda dietary recommendations thats the bloody point
2777148 i knew this would happen fast food places are now using supersize me as an excuse to give you less for your money people should just take responsiblility for their own behavior spurlocks an idiot
2777149 the big mac exceeds a percentage requirement thats why we can take just one food item what percentage requirement does the apple violate
2777150 she was hospitalized for eight days during which time she underwent skin grafting liebeck who also underwent debridement treatments sought to settle her claim for 20 000 but mcdonalds refused
2777151 mcdonalds quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees plus or minus five degrees
2777152 a scholar in thermodynamics as applied to human skin burns testified that liquids at 180 degrees will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds
2777153 we need to make informed choices and many people dont do that
2777154 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
2777155 spurlock insists he was trying to eat mcdonalds the way most people do not the way responsible people do
2777156 then you really are as dumb as your picture makes you look
2777157 as far as the dude who only eats big macs i think his caloric consumption is pretty low as i think thats all he eats 2 big macs a day and a coke or whatever
2777158 for a long time for example mcdonalds claimed its fries were vegetarian
2777159 since 1986 when bse was recognized over 180 000 cattle in the uk have developed the disease and approximately one to three million are likely to have been infected with the bse agent most of which were slaughtered for human consumption before developing signs of the disease the origin of the first case of bse is unknown but the epidemic was caused by the recycling of processed waste parts of cattle some of which were infected with the bse agent and given to other cattle in feed control measures have resulted in the consistent decline of the epidemic in the uk since 1992 infected cattle and feed exported from the uk have resulted in smaller epidemics in other european countries where control measures were applied later compelling evidence indicates that bse can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of prion contaminated meat bse infected individuals eventually develop vcjd with an incubation time believed to be on average 10 years as of november 2004 three cases of bse have been reported in north america one had been imported to canada from the uk one was grown in canada and one discovered in the usa but of canadian origin there has been only one case of vcjd reported in the usa but the patient most likely acquired the disease in the united kingdom if current control measures intended to protect public and animal health are well enforced the cattle epidemic should be largely under control and any remaining risk to humans through beef consumption should be very small
2777160 those two big macs satisfy his 1500 calorie a day requirement
2777161 wondering why your teeth are falling out and your kids are retarded
2777162 the u s department of agriculture claims it has found no evidence to support allegations by one of its meat inspectors that mad cow disease safeguards are being violated possibly exposing consumers to the deadly illness but united press international has seen internal agency documents that verify violations have occurred for many months
2777163 although the non compliance reports upi viewed indicated the beef products from the older cows were condemned and did not make it into the food supply some of the documents suggested the products were ready for distribution and could have reached consumers if they had not been caught at the last moment
2777164 any remaining risk to humans through beef consumption very small
2777165 well heres something that not many vegetarians know or care to acknowledge every year millions of animals are killed by wheat and soy bean combines during harvesting season
2777166 so let me get this straight not only are animals ruthlessly being murdered as a direct result of your diet but youre not even using the meat of the animals you kill at least were eating the animals we kill and although we also contribute to the slaughter of animals during grain harvesting keep in mind that were not the ones with a moral qualm about it not just leaving them to rot in a field somewhere that makes you just as morally repugnant than any meat eater any day not only that but youre killing free roaming animals not animals that were raised for feed their bodies get mangled in the combines machinery bones crushed and you have the audacity to point fingers at the meat industry for humanely punching a spike through a cows neck
2777167 sources time magazine july 15 2002 pg 56 steven davis professor of animal science at oregon state university at least one study has shown that simply mowing an alfalfa field caused a 50 reduction in the gray tailed vole population full article least harm principle suggests that humans should eat beef not vegan first published in the proceedings of third congress of the european society for agricultural and food ethics 2001
2777168 millions of animals die every year to provide products used in vegan diets
2777169 davis proposes a ruminant pasture model of food production which would replace all poultry pig and lamb production with beef and dairy products according to his calculations such a model would result in the deaths of 300 million fewer animals annually counting both field animals and cattle than would a total vegan model this difference according to davis is mainly the result of fewer field animals killed in pasture and forage production than in the growing and harvest of grain beans and corn
2777170 maybe someone can tell me why meat eaters are so hostile towards vegetarians
2777171 eating meat is ok choosing not to eat meat is cool too
2777172 hey i dont eat meat because i dont like it
2777173 thanks but no thanks we dont need your kind of activism

2777178 i dont think animals are here for us to use
2777179 i believe people ought to be free to make their own decisions about what they eat what they drink
2777180 that is one of the most rewarding things to emerge from this entire film experience getting to go out and talk to people about the choices we make everyday
2777181 i dont think animals are here for us to use
2777182 the parody film makes the important point that this of course isnt how manufacturers intend for their product to be used
2777183 it would be nice if mcdonalds told us how they intend their product to be used once a week everyday etc
2777184 young individuals have no way to know what is healthy and what is unhealthy food
2777185 young individuals have no way to know what is healthy and what is unhealthy food
2777186 take a look at it drinking beer like many other things is a cultural phenomenon
2777187 after all following the ban of advertising for smoking on television and radio and film everyone stopped smoking right thats how it happened yes
2777188 think ddt tobacco nutrition anything what we dont know now may harm us in the future also what the companies who make the goods we use know and wont tell us may harm us
2777189 you could have corporate for profit government seem to be doing a good job of that already in the us
2777190 regardless since when is it the manufacturers responsibility to craft your diet for you
2777191 poor people have no less a right to or need for the amenities you expect
2777192 the only ads that can be said to encourage behavior consumption of a product as opposed to a brand are those industry sponsored ones like the cheese ads
2777193 and even the most aggressive of marketing campaigns dont recommend you consume one companys food or beverage product to the exclusion of everything else
2777194 they found out what its like to live in a dictatorship
2777195 because you know after the day fidel dies the shipments of american consumer crap will come flooding in

2777210 my guess is that while this curtailed naked short selling in the short run i suspect people found clever and sophisticated ways to work around it through derivatives

2777213 our strategies remained pretty much the same what did change however was the level of compliance involved before making trades
2777214 before we can make a trade that involves short stock in those affected names we have to verify that the customer has pre borrowed the stock and then get confirmation from the firm that lent the stock this slows us down and eats up quite a bit of manpower that can be better used elsewhere

2777219 bushs basic conception of a global war on terror to take but the most obvious example has been poorly thought through badly implemented and has produced many unintended costs that will linger for years if not decades but blanket criticism of bush misses an important reality
2777220 whatever reasons and through whichever path the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream in many cases the next president should follow rather than reverse them
2777221 in the last few years many of these policies have been modified abandoned or reversed this has happened without acknowledgment which is partly what drives critics crazy and its often been done surreptitiously it doesnt reflect a change of heart so much as an admission of failure the old way simply wasnt working

2777225 a basic principle of the auditing profession is to ensure reports are factual but bbts audited reports were clearly not
2777226 investors buy shares according to their value but how can real value be determined when the authenticity of financial reports is compromised
2777227 people should be more cautious in choosing shares for investment now as some shares are likely to slump simply due to investor suspicions about a lack of transparency
2777228 many disasters caused by inaccurate financial reports are believed to involve some of the worlds leading auditors the enron and worldcom cases in the us some seven years ago are examples

2777260 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document amp 183 as outlined in mr suskinds book
2777261 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2777262 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2777263 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2777264 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2777265 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2777266 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2777267 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2777268 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2777269 the only freedom deserving the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it each is the proper guardian of his own health whether bodily or mental and spiritual mankind are greater gainers by sufering each other to live as seems good to themselves than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest

2777273 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2777274 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2777275 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
2777276 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal

2777284 we turned out to be a bit before our time on this one we not saying it is dead forever we will be looking at the market in a year or two and perhaps the current fuel crisis may mean more manufacturers will be looking to develop these kind of vehicles
2777285 this decision does not affect the hydrogen bus project of which 10 vehicles will begin operating by 2010 as planned
2777286 we will continue to monitor the development of the hydrogen vehicle market and review opportunities to support the introduction of hydrogen fuelled vehicles in london once the bus refuelling site is operational

2777295 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2777296 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all i think i gave people too much credit

2777301 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2777302 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2777303 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2777304 every night i have to read a book so that my mind will stop thinking about things that i stress about
2777305 the paperback is very interesting but i find it will never replace a hardcover book it makes a very poor doorstop
2777306 i just wrote a book but dont go out and buy it yet because i dont think its finished yet
2777307 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2777308 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2777309 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2777310 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2777311 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2777312 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2777313 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2777314 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2777315 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about
2777316 theres no way in hell im not supposed to get that route
2777317 i knew what he was running because he was in a tight split i said theres only two things hes running hes running a quick out or a dig he went up 10 yards and pushed off a little bit but you know its preseason
2777318 ill be all right its the first preseason game hopefully by the last preseason game ill be ready to go
2777319 but were learning from them were going to assess it on film and were going to try to get some things straight
2777320 we went out there and executed and did the thing that weve been doing well in practice throughout training camp so im glad we were able to take it and do it in the game
2777321 man hes got a gear that he can hit and it doesnt even look like hes changing gears
2777322 i knew what to do and i did my assignments i just didnt play up to par what i wanted to play
2777323 thats a drop if i dont catch it i didnt tuck the ball fast enough so its just something different in college you get an extra second here you dont get an extra second when youre tucking the ball away
2777324 it was definitely an experience everything would have been pretty good if i hadnt fumbled

2777326 its amazing that we can cross international boundaries and face language barriers but kids the world over love to kick a football
2777327 it was a really moving experience to play with the children here i have kids of a similar age myself and its sad to know that these children dont have parents who can kick a football around with them
2777328 its not just about giving financial assistance but also spending time with the kids and having some fun with them
2777329 the australians and the other soldiers have shown their humanity
2777330 they came here not as warriors but as caring friends the children are the future of afghanistan they just need a chance the generosity of the soldiers and the people of australia are helping the children to have that chance
2777331 this was a heinous attack by al qaeda in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2777332 the terrorists will do anything to hinder progress and incite sectarian violence their desperate attacks on coalition and iraqi security forces only harden the resolve of the bonds built to defeat aqi and special groups criminals
2777333 our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to our soldiers the families and the iraqi people we will hunt down those responsible
2777334 a much tougher approach is needed to guard against what they call unfair or deceptive practices
2777335 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
2777336 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

2777338 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2777339 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2777340 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2777341 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2777342 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more

2777350 oh well the dnc supports gay rights and besides howard deans a friend to gay rights
2777351 didnt you also say at the time that the whole idea of legally sanctioned gay relationships made you feel uncomfortable
2777352 i do not consider her in any way shape or form homophobic
2777353 i wanted equal representation for gay and lesbian americans and i wanted to achieve it in a way that wasnt offensive to the history of the civil rights movement
2777354 direct action to stop war is as their name implies trying to stop the wars in iraq and afghanistan
2777355 with nearly 10 of those currently serving in iraq or afghanistan doing so under stop loss the military has
2777356 troops tours of duty will fall from fifteen months to twelve
2777357 the summer soldier and sunshine patriot will flee from service to our country
2777358 better than nothing but it doesnt address the larger issue
2777359 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2777360 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2777364 we are here tonight because the democratic voters have made their choice and so have i
2777365 john edwards also embarrassed himself in that debate noting he was against gay marriage and i do not support it leading us to shout back at the screen gee john we werent aware you were being inundated with proposals
2777366 to say that he slept with her but he wasnt in love with her thats not very chivalrous hes trying to distance himself from her i dont feel my questions have been answered with regard to edwards it was a half assed confession
2777367 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2777368 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2777369 come on we can have a better country we can change this around
2777370 well if i were president the home mortgage crisis wouldnt have happened and the oil prices wouldnt be what they are
2777371 dont vote for eugene debbs youre throwing your vote away
2777372 you got two choices you stay home and not vote or if you want your vote to mean something and you want to be with the winner you vote for one of the two major party candidates otherwise you are wasting your vote
2777373 were those voters in the 19th century who spun off from the whigs and the democrats and didnt try to spin the difference between these two parties on slavery waste their vote
2777374 ive done surveys and polls all over the country heres my conclusion 15 of the republicans will vote for the republican nominee if the republican nominee was leon trotsky and 15 of the democrats would vote for the democratic nominee if the nominee was ayn rand
2777375 its exactly what karl rove wants us to do is to initiate impeachment
2777376 i think i got to go to the airport so i can get home
2777377 better to vote for someone you believe in and lose than someone you dont believe in and win

2777380 as nice as he was i just couldnt bring myself to put myself through spending another minute with him
2777381 i want that beer and therefore it would be immoral of me to not go get it
2777382 this election is about sen barack obama not that senator mccain is not an important figure but senator obama is either going to win or lose because americans are going to decide that he can sit in the oval office and that hes able to do it and clearly a myriad of polls are showing that americans are skeptical
2777383 we have six percent recall and we are too lazy to test ourselves

2777389 we live in a time when the bible has come under a lot of criticism and attack as not being reliable or authoritative
2777390 archaeology allows us to see the geography and historicity of the bible is correct many times weve been able to find a name or a city on a dig associated with a biblical event and were able to say to the critics theyre not myths the bible is accurate it also helps build your faith
2777391 its hard to give exact dates when you get beyond the early bronze age because the styles begin to run together
2777392 pottery is how you determine dating for an archaeological site because pottery only changed every few hundred years with style design and shape
2777393 si no quieres tirar por tierra todo el esfuerzo y sacrificio que has tenido durante todos estos a os sera mejor que mantengas la boca cerrada
2777394 its just an utter tragedy its as simple as that theres nothing to hang it on its just a crazy man
2777395 how do you live with that how do you live with any of it the mind just doesnt want to comprehend any of it really its just so random and incredible

2777407 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2777408 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2777409 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2777410 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2777411 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2777412 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2777413 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2777414 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2777420 if property values are going down why did my assessment go up
2777421 if you cant park your vehicle in your own parking lot thats just wrong
2777422 there are going to be people who are going to be inconvenienced but were very lucky it is not as bad as it could have been
2777423 its nice to see the overwhelming support for this program each year the response by the students and the community reminds those deployed that we have not forgotten about them what a sweet way to say thanks
2777424 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction
2777425 we blew whistles around 7 20 a m when we confirmed the escape

2777427 the wicket flattened out it was quite slow and took bounce out of the equation its still a very good wicket
2777428 we knew we didnt want them to get away from us its a very quick scoring ground at the oval with the square being so large but we didnt want de villiers to get away and the new ball comes a bit harder
2777429 we set defending fields with the aim of keeping them to a total of about 320 and thats what they got
2777430 we are pleased to have 10 wickets in hand going into the final day if we can win it will be a great ending and a fantastic start for kev as captain

2777445 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2777446 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough
2777447 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster
2777448 i was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack but are we going to attack before or after the election
2777449 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran
2777450 the frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table even nuclear first strike
2777451 that is my sense because the democratic leaders in the house are proposing no resistance whatsoever paul said
2777452 we saw this when a supplemental bill came up and the president asked for 107 billion for the war the democrat leadership gave them 162 billion
2777453 it is still totally bewildering to me when i see men and women in the congress that i know and like doing this just to get along
2777454 imagine a huge white glass cube filled with robots all hunkered over computers and drum machines and synthesizers and equalizers everything totally automated huge gears turning machines pulsing the robots locked into the same motion over and over a strange assembly line at the end a tiny speaker facing a huge empty grassy field a blue sky nothing in the sky but a single white cloud perfectly ovoid out of the speaker comes this thats what we imagine when we listen to unitxt
2777455 thats not good news for a lot of reform ideas
2777456 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2777457 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2777458 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2777459 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2777460 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2777461 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2777462 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2777463 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2777464 an epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here stop i am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin stop mail is only form of transportation stop i have made application to commissioner of health of the territories for antitoxin already stop there are about 3000 white natives in the district

2777467 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force

2777469 every nickel counts at this point i think its all going into the gas
2777470 the price has come down but more important what im hearing is the supply side to supermarket retailers is better because tourist consumption is down in maine
2777471 ive never seen anything like it where im able to promote lobsters at a reasonable price
2777472 if the economy stays like this its going to put a lot of guys out of business
2777473 theres probably going to be some people fishing this year who arent going to be around next year the guys that have low debt will survive and the ones that have debt wont
2777474 it puts a real strain on your business youre operating at a very slim margin
2777475 so the lobsterman gets squeezed because hes got the cost going up and hes got a product he has to get rid of because if you do raise the price too high it shuts off the markets
2777476 pretty soon restaurants take it off the menu and say call me when it gets more reasonable
2777477 the average family isnt going out for a lobster dinner this summer with the high cost of fuel and everything else
2777478 thats probably the biggest issue facing everybody and we dont have any control over that
2777479 thats the type of food where if you want it youre going to get it

2777498 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2777499 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2777500 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2777501 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2777502 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2777503 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2777504 gravity always wins we just help to smooth out our landings thats all
2777505 in all my time ive only known three goose that came to grief
2777506 thats not to say youre guaranteed 100 per cent no accidents theres always murphys law you know
2777507 my specialty is flying in the mountains doing some of the windy horrible things that might scare a lot of other people off
2777508 ive just been doing it for so long that its not a big deal for me
2777509 the engine came apart and i ended up in the trees and ended up walking home
2777510 it was really scary especially if it goes poof and everything goes quiet
2777511 that machine had never been within 50 miles of the ocean ever
2777512 people going beyond their capability and pushing the airplane beyond their capability
2777513 weather is one of the biggest things and get homeitis youre in a hurry to get home so you push a little bit
2777514 you want to look like the macho hero so you say aw i can do it somebody else did it so i should be able to thats not always true
2777515 were all asked that but this is my 33rd year of flying i can say no i wont pick you up there ill pick you up over here
2777516 ive been in the business a long time and ive got a lot of friends that arent here anymore trying to be heroes
2777517 it actually pulled out of it without the rotors even turning fast enough
2777518 i feel like as a patriot i should do my bit in contributing to the improvement of russia
2777519 in the u s there has been an explosion of internal russian patriotism they have remained americans but they increasingly associate themselves with russian culture
2777520 if todays russia has putins cold mask for its emblem i dont really like that
2777521 this could have been achieved without losing the human face
2777522 ten years ago russia was being taught how to live today russia can itself teach others how to live
2777523 today when people who speak russian see that their compatriots received the same status and level in the world in hollywood in high society
2777524 it means that it russia is hip it is cool
2777525 i consider myself more russian than american which is surprising to a lot of people

2777528 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2777529 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2777530 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2777531 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2777532 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2777533 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2777534 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2777535 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease

2777560 we went into the game knowing this tragedy had happened and also knew that four years had gone into this
2777561 we came into the tournament playing wonderful usa volleyball some of the greatest this decade this is about the team not individual people
2777562 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2777563 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2777564 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible

2777573 i dont know if my church loves me any more or not
2777574 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2777575 apa yang bisa paman tahu pasti akan paman jawab semua pertanyaanmu
2777576 saya sangat kagum pada keberhasilan paman kalau boleh tahu apa rahasia sukses paman hingga memiliki beragam bisnis yang berbeda tapi rata rata bisa sukses seperti saat ini padahal saya tahu bahwa pendidikan paman tidak cukup tinggi bahasa inggris pun belepotan hebatnya saya lihat sendiri orang orang yang bekerja sama dengan paman rata rata justru berpendidikan jauh di atas paman bagaimana bisa begitu paman saya benar benar ingin tahu dan belajar dari paman
2777577 insting apa maksud paman berkat tuhan kenapa tuhan bisa memilih paman untuk diberkati
2777578 begini pertama tama jujur paman akui bahwa pamanmu ini memang tidak berpendidikan formal tetapi bukan tidak terdidik justru karena pendidikan paman rendah paman memulai segala sesuatu melalui jalur trial and error dan jika dihitung dengan uang pendidikan yang paman tempuh biayanya sungguh sangat besar sama dengan biaya di sekolah formal malahan bisa bisa lebih mahal orang tahunya paman yang sukses hari ini orang mungkin tidak pernah tahu berapa kali paman jatuh bangun mendirikan bisnis ini pengalaman mengajarkan tidak peduli berapa kali kita jatuh pastikan bangun lagi akhirnya paman pun berhasil menguasai know how bisnis dengan baik dan setelah paman berhasil menanamkan fondasi dan mulai merangkak naik juga tidak lantas berpuas diri ingat semakin tinggi pijakan kita angin pun semakin kencang dan selalu berubah arah maka di dunia usaha yang terus berubah kita harus pandai pandai belajar membaca arah dan perubahan angin setelah itu barulah mengatur bagaimana manajemen yang baik dan mendelegasikan pekerjaan melalui anak anak muda yang berpendidikan tinggi seperti kamu
2777579 tuhan memberi berkat kepada setiap manusia tergantung kita yang menerima bagaimana mengelola memanfaatkan dan mengembangkan berkat itu dengan kemampuan kita yang luar biasa maka paman selalu percaya berkat tuhan selalu tersedia untuk paman bagaimana puas dengan pelajaran hari ini
2777580 terima kasih paman saya berjanji akan belajar mengelola berkat seperti yang telah paman lakukan tolong jangan bosan mengajari saya ya paman
2777581 one of the most indefensible things the bush administration has done in the last few years
2777582 for behold the lord will come in fire and his chariots like whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire for the lord will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh and those slain by the lord will be many
2777583 heaven will disappear with a roar the host of god will come to destroy sin is a declaration of war
2777584 ill be happy when we have more than just prom songs to jesus sung by some effeminate guy on an acoustic guitar offered as mainstream worship music right now most worship music is still coming from the top down through such things as christian radio and record labels but the trend today in a lot of churches is writing your own music to reflect your culture and community and i pray this trend of music from the bottom up continues
2777585 my response is that we are commanded to love the lost and singing songs about god destroying the world may not be the best way to show his love to the lost and if you dont care about how you come accross to the lost i dont understand how you can say you love the lost
2777586 for indeed jews ask for signs and greeks search for wisdom but we preach christ crucified to jews a stumbling block and to gentiles foolishness
2777587 for i determined to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified
2777588 i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom
2777589 for the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
2777590 the host of god will come to destroy sin is a declaration of war
2777591 on its human side i assume that it was produced and preserved by competent human beings who were at least as intelligent and devout as we are today i assume that they were quite capable of accurately interpreting their own experience in the language of their historical community which we today can understand with due diligence on the divine side i assume that god has been willing and competent to arrange for the bible including its record of jesus to emerge and be preserved in ways that will secure his purposes for it among human beings worldwide those who actually believe in god will not be troubled by this
2777592 this kind of realization coincided with the problems i was encountering the more closely i studied the surviving greek manuscripts of the new testament it is one thing to say that the originals were inspired but the reality is that we dont have the originals so saying they were inspired doesnt help me much unless i can reconstruct the originals moreover the vast majority of christians for the entire history of the church have not had access to the originals making their inspiration something of a moot point not only do we not have the originals we dont have the first copies of the originals we dont even have copies of the copies of the originals or copies of the copies of the copies of the originals what we have are copies made later much later in most instances they are copies made many centuries later and these copies all differ from one another in many thousands of places as we will see later in this book these copies differ from one another in many places that we dont even know how many differences there are possibly it is easiest to put it in comparative terms there are more differences among our manuscripts than there are words in the new testament this became a problem for my view of inspiration for i came to realize that it would have been no more difficult for god to preserve the words of scripture than it would have been for him to inspire them in the first place the bible began to appear to me as a very human book just as human scribes had copied and changed the texts of scripture so too had human authors originally written the texts of scripture this was a human book from beginning to end in all these ways they differed from one another among other things this meant that mark did not say the same thing that luke said because he didnt mean the same thing as luke john is different from matthew not the same paul is different from acts and james is different from paul each author is a human author and needs to be read for what he assuming they were all men has to say not assuming that what he says is the same or comfortable to or consistent with what every other author has to say the bible at the end of the day is a very human book
2777593 such a spirit has no wisdom it puts up laws and rules to avoid thinking grace and wisdom come when one is apart from this sort of religious rigidity
2777594 either the bible is the inerrant word of god or a bunch of garbage that you can simply throw out
2777595 we are now at a point where we can create photoreal characters but it is hugely labor intensive and it is really expensive
2777596 can we do an absolutely totally realistic elvis presley probably not but that is because he is so well known
2777597 but if we had to create a character that nobody had ever seen before that might be possible at this point and in a few years it will be possible to do elvis a lot of people think it is possible now i dont
2777598 given enough time and money anybody can create anything but given a very very restricted budget and very restricted resources its a challenge we had to build studios train people from scratch hire artists develop new techniques we did not make this in the normal way you make an animated feature
2777599 when things are intense and theres a lot at stake i have no trouble focusing but when theyre not intense my brain starts popping off in all sorts of places
2777600 cg renders realism but thats not art for me there is no artist interpretation there its just a technical facility
2777601 there is more crossover cg hand drawn work today computer technology has made jobs like inking scanning and painting much easier
2777602 youre going to find a generation of kids going forward that expect to wear glasses when they go into a movie theater

2777616 the reason why indians strongly demand that they must never be disturbed is because that writing all those rock writings they are there to remind the young people that there was a person with knowledge on this earth for thousands of years before people came from europe
2777617 these paintings are to be found in places such as cliffs overlooking or close to lakes and streams near waterfalls within and around caves on the walls of canyons natural amphitheaters and on boulders near trails generally they are in lonely and secluded places near where indians were in the habit of holding vigil and undergoing training during the period of their puberty ceremonies when they generally acquired their manitous guardian spirits these places were considered mysterious and were the haunts of mysteries from whom they expected power
2777618 were no strangers to love you know the rules and so do i a full commitments what im thinking of you wouldnt get this from any other guy i just wanna tell you how im feeling gotta make you understand never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you never gonna make you cry never gonna say goodbye never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
2777619 hundreds of students staff and community members are expected to again pour into the lgi of guilderland high school this tuesday august 12 2008 meeting at 7pm for the guilderland board of education meeting the last three meetings have garnished intense media coverage as well as hundreds and hundreds of individuals in attendance

2777687 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2777688 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2777689 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2777690 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2777691 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2777692 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2777693 assessing technological risk is a thorny enough problem here on earth even with our experience and our intuition about familiar uncertainties factors and processes but transport the problem into the unearthly venue of outer space where human experience is limited and sound assessment becomes astronomically more challenging a notable and illuminating case in point was the u s decision earlier this year to use a missile to knock out a derelict spy satellite to head off the possibility of its splashing a half ton of toxic hydrazine fuel somewhere on earth that official explanation of the shootdown and it turns out an entirely plausible and credible explanation nonetheless met with a chorus of public criticism and skepticism coming as it did barely a year after china shot down one of its satellites with a missile in what struck many observers as an obvious antisatellite weapon demonstration the u s shootdown was widely but i believe incorrectly seen as a response to that event

2777707 and now o you priests this commandment is for you
2777708 speak to the priests the sons of aaron and say to them no one shall make himself unclean for the dead among his people 2 except for his
2777709 lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
2777710 the priest who is chief among his brothers on whose head the anointing oil is poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments shall not let the hair of his head hang loose nor tear his clothes 11 he shall not go in to any dead bodies nor make himself unclean even for his father or for his mother 12 he shall not go out of the sanctuary lest he profane the sanctuary of his god for the consecration of the anointing oil of his god is on him i am the lord 13 and he shall take a wife in her virginity 14 a widow or a divorced woman or a woman who has been defiled or a prostitute these he shall not marry but he shall take as his wife a virgin of his own people 15 that he may not profane his offspring among his people for i am the lord who sanctifies him
2777711 holiness is readily defined time and time again throughout leviticus which ultimately speaks of gods personality leviticus is gods biography and he is manifestly telling us that christ is not going to marry a
2777712 speak to aaron saying none of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the bread of his god 18 for no one who has a blemish shall draw near a man blind or lame or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long 19 or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand 20 or a hunchback or a dwarf or a man with a defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles 21 no man of the offspring of aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the lords food offerings since he has a blemish he shall not come near to offer the bread of his god 22 he may eat the bread of his god both of the most holy and of the holy things 23 but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar because he has a blemish that he may not profane my sanctuaries for i am the lord who sanctifies them
2777713 speak to aaron and his sons so that they abstain from the holy things of the people of israel which they dedicate to me so that they do not profane my holy name i am the lord
2777714 the church in the power of the spirit a contribution of messianic ecclesiology
2777715 it is not the church that has a mission of salvation to fulfill in the world it is the mission of the son and the spirit through the father which includes the church
2777716 a lay person shall not eat of a holy thing no foreign guest of the priest or hired servant shall eat of a holy thing 11 but if a priest buys a slave as his property for money the slave may eat of it and anyone born in his house may eat of his food 12 if a priests daughter marries a layman she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy things 13 but if a priests daughter is widowed or divorced and has no child and returns to her fathers house as in her youth she may eat of her fathers food yet no lay person shall eat of it 14 and if anyone eats of a holy thing unintentionally he shall add the fifth of its value to it and give the holy thing to the priest 15 they shall not profane the holy things of the people of israel which they contribute to the lord 16 and so cause them to bear iniquity and guilt by eating their holy things for i am the lord who sanctifies them
2777717 i thank you father lord of heaven and earth that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children 26 yes father for such was your gracious will
2777718 speak to aaron and his sons and all the people of israel and say to them when any one of the house of israel or of the sojourners in israel presents a burnt offering as his offering for any of their vows or freewill offerings that they offer to the lord 19 if it is to be accepted for you it shall be a male without blemish of the bulls or the sheep or the goats 20 you shall not offer anything that has a blemish for it will not be acceptable for you 21 and when anyone offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the lord to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock to be accepted it must be perfect there shall be no blemish in it 22 animals blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or an itch or scabs you shall not offer to the lord or give them to the lord as a food offering on the altar 23 you may present a bull or a lamb that has a part too long or too short for a freewill offering but for a vow offering it cannot be accepted 24 any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not offer to the lord you shall not do it within your land 25 neither shall you offer as the bread of your god any such animals gotten from a foreigner since there is a blemish in them because of their mutilation they will not be accepted for you
2777719 when an ox or sheep or goat is born it shall remain seven days with its mother and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as a food offering to the lord
2777720 so you shall keep my commandments and do them i am the lord 32 and you shall not profane my holy name that i may be sanctified among the people of israel i am the lord who sanctifies you 33 who brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am the lord
2777721 i am the lord who brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am the lord
2777722 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you if you dont let it get the best of you

2777727 we have been notified that russia has plans to move elements of its black sea fleet to abkhazia to ochamchira ostensibly to protec t their civilians a couple of cruisers or large scale naval vessels
2777728 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia

2777743 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2777744 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2777745 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2777746 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2777747 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2777748 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2777749 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2777750 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2777751 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2777752 russias president dmitry medvedev said that moscow sent troops into south ossetia to protect its peacekeepers and civilians on a mission to
2777753 russian officials said they werent targeting civilians but russias foreign minister sergey lavrov said that
2777754 its regrettable that russian civilians and troops were killed when georgia tried to assert their legitimate authority in south ossetia
2777755 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster
2777756 i was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack but are we going to attack before or after the election
2777757 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran
2777758 the frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table even nuclear first strike
2777759 that is my sense because the democratic leaders in the house are proposing no resistance whatsoever paul said
2777760 we saw this when a supplemental bill came up and the president asked for 107 billion for the war the democrat leadership gave them 162 billion

2777771 narrative games are barely past the infant stage and critical commentary and analysis about them are even less developed
2777772 everyone is still trying to figure out who everyone else is and in this process communities form themselves we are on the ground floor of this effort to try to figure out how to talk intelligently about video games how to analyze them and develop a critical language to discuss them were not like other disciplines im not even sure i would call us a discipline yet because were all figuring this out together we dont even have the terms yet
2777773 part of our trepidation about what to call it is that there is already a field called game studies and some of us arent comfortable with where thats going or dont feel we quite fit in there

2777779 the chief executive of the council peter mcnaney and gerry lennon of the belfast visitors and convention centre wanted the former lord mayor to sign off on the logo but he categorically refused they were gobsmacked
2777780 instead of giving his seal of approval councillor rodgers stood up and said hed listened to the views of people from the working groups and it was clear they werent happy he said more work needed to be done
2777781 it was very embarrassing news of what had happened spread like wildfire around the council
2777782 three years on and we still dont have any justice for thomas
2777783 we have put our faith in the justice system but it has failed us to date
2777784 what kind of message is this giving to thomas friends and the young people of this new northern ireland
2777785 one man has been charged in relation to the attack on thomas and his friends but this is a very light charge
2777786 the police have worked hard on the investigation and we know they are also unhappy with the pps direction
2777787 the director has agreed to undertake a review of the decision not to prosecute
2777788 the pps has met the family of thomas devlin on a number of occasions over recent months furthermore the pps has written to the family on friday in relation to concerns which they have raised about the decision not to prosecute
2777789 the pps are so cautious in their approach compared to england and this is so frustrating
2777790 the cps will also discuss cases with investigating officers but the pps dont do it and its hard to understand why this is the case
2777791 we have looked at many cases in england including the murder of rhys jones where many people have been charged from murder to assisting offenders and this is the justice that we are seeking
2777792 the cps will charge someone with murder if they are accused of being at the scene but havent pulled the trigger for example why is this joint enterprise policy not used in northern ireland
2777793 the people who murdered my son are still walking the streets and thats why we have formally requested for the pps ruling to be reviewed by an independent qc who has experience of similar cases our request has been noted and we are now just waiting for a response
2777794 three years on and people are still not telling the truth of over thomas murder
2777795 these people have the information that could put my sons killers behind bars but they are still remaining silent
2777796 by remaining silent they are just as culpable as the men who murdered my son
2777797 these people should remember that withholding information is a very serious offence
2777798 we are asking them to search their conscience and come forward because its never to late
2777799 once the mother and son move to liverpool the father may visit him on alternate weekends although this arrangement must be as flexible as possible depending on the travel and accommodation conditions that the father can get on each occasion and with prior notice the childs mother
2777800 the son shall spend the summer holidays with his parents dividing the period in half so that he spends at least 15 consecutive days with his father and a further 15 days with his mother
2777801 exceptionally the child is to spend the whole of the first christmas 2002 to 2003 with his mother since she is intending to move to liverpool with him for the entire holiday period while the first summer holidays 2003 that are due to the father shall be spent in liverpool in the company of the mother as well unless the relationship between the two parents makes this inadvisable in which case they shall be limited to daytime visits until the child reaches four years of age and from then on proceeds normally in accordance with the previous paragraph
2777802 in any event the spouses agree to make the foregoing access and holiday arrangements suitably flexible and modify them in accordance with the employment commitments of the father and mother but in the case of dispute the terms of the above agreement must be observed
2777803 should the son fall ill this shall be sufficient cause to interrupt the access arrangements although in such cases the father shall be permitted to visit the child at the mothers address and the latter must submit medical reports certifying the illness
2777804 s r loves his father he looks forward to seeing him and enjoys the time they spend together provided that time is not too long and s r knows his mother is nearby
2777805 during our first appointment it became clear that s r worried considerably about staying with his father is spain he appeared to enjoy spending time with the father but did not want to spend prolonged periods of time in spain away from his mother he enjoyed his fathers short visits in liverpool but preferred returning to his own house to sleep as opposed to remaining in the guesthouse overnight with his father according to his mother level of worry escalates when they mention spain
2777806 during this session the father repeated much of what the mother had reported earlier namely that s r had become extremely distressed at the thought of spending prolonged periods of time with him in spain he i e the father was confused and troubled about this and made it clear that he wanted to rectify the situation he did express a degree of annoyance at the situation feeling that his relationship with his son was being sidelined by the mother
2777807 we feel s r would benefit from a slow gradual increase in the amount of time spent with his father it is our opinion that this could begin in liverpool as opposed to spain it is our opinion that a visit to spain would only be successful should liverpool visits become more positive and once s r has happily stayed away from his mother overnight
2777808 the grounds of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility established in the present regulation are shaped in the light of the best interests of the child in particular on the criterion of proximity this means that jurisdiction should lie in the first place with the member state of the childs habitual residence except for certain cases of a change in the childs residence or pursuant to an agreement between the holders of parental responsibility

2777827 a has become the habitual residence of the child after the court referred to in paragraph 1 was seised or
2777828 b is the former habitual residence of the child or

2777919 the enactment of new permanent measures such as the extension of the 2001 tax cuts without means to pay for them would be counterproductive conversely measures that pointed to long term fiscal savings would reinforce fiscal stimulus

2777989 in terms of shipbuilding it is sure that bangladesh has future in the area over the past two years two ships have been built here we believe that bangladesh could be the next nation of shipbuilders
2777990 but the current vat system needs to be reformed as the value added tax in bangladesh is actually one kind of excise tax
2777991 i request the government to liberalise the vat system it has to be designed properly so that the businessmen and others have easy access to the system

2778001 all of us have to do our best to expand trade in internal and external arena and ensure political stability at home we hope good sense will prevail over everyone

2778018 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2778019 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2778020 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2778045 the longer it has to leach down they would have to dig a bit deeper but youre going to be talking about a small quantity of liquids

2778077 the paradox of multiculturalism ethnicity race and identity in the philippines
2778078 a mode of study which is engaged and which seeks not the truth but knowledge and understanding as a practical and material means of communicating with and helping to empower subordinate social groups and movements
2778079 part of the general process which creates conventions and institutions through which the meanings that are valued by the community are shared and made active
2778080 through which necessarily though among other means a social order is communicated reproduced experienced and explored
2778081 a socially shared and reciprocal activity already embedded in active relationships within which every move is an activation of what is already shared and reciprocal or may become so
2778082 the attempt to discover the nature of the organization which is the complex of these relationships
2778083 it is a way of seeing a group in and through individual differences that specificity of individuals and of their individual creations which does not deny but is the necessary way of affirming their real social identities in language in conventions in certain characteristic situations experiences interpretations ideas
2778084 the reality of the interpenetration in a final sense the unity of the most individual and the most social forms of actual life
2778085 we learn each element as a precipitate but in the living experience of the time every element was in solution an inseparable part of a complex whole
2778086 practical consciousness of a present kind in a living and interrelating continuity
2778087 for we have really to look in country and city alike at the real social processes of alienation separation externality abstraction experiences of directness connection mutuality sharing which alone can define in the end what the real deformation may be
2778088 a strategy in discourse rather than immediate experience or an organic
2778089 for what is knowable is not only a function of objects of what is there to be known
2778090 the principles of this organization and structure can be seen as directly related to certain social intentions connected to the rule of a particular class
2778091 whole body of practices and expectations our assignments of energy our ordinary understanding of the nature of man and his world
2778092 modes of domination select from and consequently exclude the full range of actual and possible human practice
2778093 an effect of the conditions of operation of the enunciative function
2778094 it is nevertheless true that from the outset cultural studies efforts to recover working class culture and history and to synthesize progressive traditions in western intellectual history had had both overt and implicit political aims
2778095 not reflective but constitutive in the formation of the modern world as constitutive as economic political or social processes which do not operate outside of cultural and ideological conditions
2778096 depend on meaning for their effects and have cultural or ideological conditions of existence
2778097 reducing those forms of intelligibility to their socio economic or class location or social position
2778098 an articulation is thus the form of the connection that can make a unity of two different elements under certain conditions the unity which matters is a linkage between that articulated discourse composed of elements without any necessary belongingness and the social forces with which it can under certain historical conditions but need not necessarily be connected
2778099 within the determining lines of force of material relations and the expropriation of nature material conditions are the necessary but not sufficient condition of all historical practice
2778100 return with a vengeance to the old and quintessential principles of bourgeois political ideology which had been progressively obscured by years of social democracy welfare state and keynesianism
2778101 a punctual and sometimes even ephemeral totalization in which the planes of race gender class ethnicity and sexuality intersect to form an operative structure
2778102 the power of hegemonic forces in the definition of womens role as consumer rather consumption
2778103 a formal deconstructionism which isnt asking questions about the insertion of symbolic processes into societal contexts and their imbrication with power is not interested in the cultural studies problematic
2778104 spontaneous bent of cultural studies is actually conformist at its worst the theoretical self consciousness of satellite television and shopping malls
2778105 there is no space and in fact no need for struggle if all popular culture abstracted from
2778106 the openness of the social as the constitutive ground or negative essence of the existing and the diverse social orders as precarious and ultimately failed attempts to domesticate the field of differences
2778107 all identity is relational there is no essence no structure which underlies the signifier social identity is symbolic and relational not fixed independently of any articulation
2778108 the articulations of subject positions and identities into specific places and spaces on socially constructed territories
2778109 protocol of ludic reading this genealogy or eventalization to mask the rigid divisions of class struggle
2778110 there is no space and in fact no need for struggle if all popular culture abstrcted from high culture and from the historical realities of inequality and domination is already active and critical if television and shopping are alread theaters of subversion
2778111 the use of means of consumption is determined by custom and tradition i construe consumption as the appropriation of any meaningful object in which the key role is played by the relay of social meaning or social import in the mere use of things man as person can only realize himself via moral mediation
2778112 how cultural analysis constitutes its objects societies traditions communities identities in spatial terms and through specific spatial practices of research
2778113 the portrayal and understanding of local global historical encounters co productions dominations and resistances consequently one needs to focus on hybrid cosmopolitan experiences as much as on rooted native ones

2778115 borderland culture areas populated by strong diasporic ethnicities unevenly assimilated
2778116 time lag decries inequalities against the drone of pluralism and multiculturalism
2778117 a new reading of popular practices and of the reappropriation by popular actors of the space of hegemonic sociocultural production
2778118 offers no understanding of the native from the natives point of view no specifiable evidence for his attributions of intention his assertions of subjectivity his declarations of experience
2778119 a theory of codes and of code production grounded in a broader theory of social practice and reconnected to hermeneutics
2778120 life is conducted in discursive conditions not of our own making
2778121 simultaneously to grasp culture in and for itself but also in relationship to its outside its content its context and its space of intervention and of effectivity
2778122 the causally generated presentation of social objects and their explanatory critique in terms of their conditions of being both those which are historically specific and praxis dependent and those which genuinely are not
2778123 what cultural studies must do and has the capacity to do is to articulate insights about the constitutive and political nature of representation itself about its complexities about the effects of language about textuality as a site of life and death
2778124 the materiality of its own construction as a discourse of knowledge
2778125 an environment process and hegemony in which individuals in their private circumstances and their works are embedded as well as overseen at the top by a whole series of methodological attitudes
2778126 the range of meanings and ideas conveyed by the phrases belonging to or in a place being at home in a place
2778127 cultural studies does not require us to repudiate elite cultural forms or simply to acknowledge with bourdieu 1984 that distinctions between elite and popular cultural forms are themselves the products of relations of power
2778128 it would be a form of logocentrism the old vision of speculative rationalism to believe that an intellectual procedure necessarily leads to a particular politics
2778129 australia appears to be in a safe zone of fertility despite fertility levels being below replacement levels there is no fertility crisis
2778130 much of the increase in the fertility rate is likely to reflect the fact that over the last few decades younger women postponed childbearing and many are now having those postponed babies

2778218 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2778219 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2778220 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2778221 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2778222 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2778223 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2778224 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2778225 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease
2778226 i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow will come and go without that happening
2778227 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan

2778283 sorpresa no adesso facciamo i presuntuosi non stata una sorpresa loro di tagliariol matteo stato grande ha avuto una progressione straordinaria tolti i primi punti in finale ha sempre condotto lui ma limportante
2778284 che dopo tanti anni quasi 50 questa disciplina ottiene un oro la scherma non delude mai ed il merito va s alla federazione ma certamente anche ai grandi atleti ed ai grandi tecnici oggi peraltro una giornata abbastanza trionfale per i nostri sport oltre a questo oro abbiamo un argento ed un bronzo andiamo avanti rimaniamo umili ed i risultati si vedranno alla fine emozionato io mi emoziono sempre

2778287 me gustan las canciones intensas a la gente le gustan y si me las piden yo encantada las canto
2778288 s que tienen temas para m no los he escuchado pero s que ellos escriben pensando en m tengo una amistad de largo tiempo con ambos y me conocen perfectamente
2778289 quiero que mis versiones no se parezcan a la original y que no sean una copia mal hecha de algo bien hecho como por cobard a de lila deneken que cant en el reality yo no lo hab a escuchado y cuando lo cant puedo decir que lo hice de mi propiedad
2778290 ya hemos recibido algunas y la que me parece muy buena es lo que son las cosas de ednita nazario
2778291 en breve vamos a sacar un nuevo ep a n no sabemos c mo lo titularemos incluir nuevas melod as que son las que actualmente estamos promocionando excendedor y piezas mismas que han sido muy bien recibidas en los toquines
2778292 el primer ep que hicimos fue la pechocha luego fue a new hope of freestail y en 2007 sacamos en conjunto con muchos amigos musicales un cd de mixes y lados b de algunas de nuestras canciones se llam bambeemix en ese mismo a o dimos a conocer un compilado que se llam records 04 07
2778293 las 20 rolas que hemos grabado hasta ahora son de nuestra inspiraci n la ltima que sacamos fue excendedor de la cual grabaremos el primer video en la historia de la banda de manera independiente con el apoyo de una casa productora de saltillo llamada perromuerto
2778294 hemos tocado en muchos lados de aqu y tambi n de monterrey saltillo y durango en unos d as estaremos tocando en el rockmez palacio fest el 22 de agosto en las instalaciones de la feria luego en torre n en el rock amp luchas en el gimnasio alamedas y el 29 en el barrio antiguo de la sultana del norte despu s nos vamos a la capital del estado para la grabaci n del clip
2778295 consideramos que somos unos chavos muy perseverantes desde que iniciamos el concepto de bamb e nos han tocado vivir algunas situaciones de las que hemos salido adelante tocando porque es lo que nos gusta hacer
2778296 hace cuatros a os comenzamos en la escena musical y no quitaremos el dedo del rengl n queremos seguir haciendo m sica y tirar rock por donde quiera que vayamos
2778297 el disco sigue estando dentro de mi afici n por lo urbano regional aunque esta vez m s light porque he decidido hablar m s sobre el amor y mis experiencias a comparaci n de mi primer material donde me burlaba de m o el segundo el cual ten a muchas connotaciones sexuales
2778298 aunque muchos me conocen como una persona despapayosa este trabajo ha sido sumamente especial y a la vez dif cil pues estoy dando a conocer mi lado m s ntimo
2778299 ich habe mich mit marcelinho unterhalten und er hat sich klar ge u ert es liegt noch kein konkretes angebot vor aber es kann sein dass ich mich in der n chsten woche damit besch ftigen muss

2778301 it leaves you with the impression that the white house is run as a fraternity house with no reverence for hierarchy the office itself or the implications of policy
2778302 everybody calling everybody else nicknames and chatting about going to war as if they were chatting about how to bet on a football game the notion that his schedule is driven by whats on espn the cable sports channel is ridiculous
2778303 this is one of the hardest moments of my career and one of the hardest decisions ive had to take
2778304 i was so looking forward to playing here and being part of this occasion
2778305 ive tried everything to recover and ive had more treatments in 10 days than ive had in my life
2778306 i tried to play in montreal and get some matches but it was so painful i went back to get some more treatment
2778307 i decided to come here and try to practise but it was too painful i havent played at all in the last 10 days
2778308 this kind of injury takes time and unfortunately i didnt have that
2778309 i dont want to get my hopes too high because i only have two weeks to recover its really frustrating we will talk to the doctors again and see what the best thing is to do
2778310 i dont know what the situation is at the moment
2778311 weve had a chat but to be honest i dont know whether its dead or alive
2778312 regarding the signing of players i take things so far and then let other people at the club get on with it
2778313 they know my beliefs and thoughts on what we should and shouldnt do
2778314 im telling you im blown away by his performance tonight one of our guys said it looks like hes hitting him with lunch boxes the guy is a phenomenon ill be honest i didnt think he could come in here with no fights and compete at this level he proved me wrong
2778315 after that first fight against mir i had all the guys come up to me hughes liddell rampage and said this guy is going to be scary in a couple of years hes a monster i dont know what guys are going to want to fight him
2778316 ive been told the club want me but then when i went to talk about a contract they arent interested so ive been left confused
2778317 i spoke to fulham about an extended contract and they werent willing to give me one until i came closer to the end of my current deal
2778318 i have always said that i am very happy at chelsea
2778319 its a great team with great players and a great coach
2778320 everythings going well here and i have two years left on my contract and i will spend them at chelsea
2778321 we havent had any recent contact with real madrid has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right
2778322 they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
2778323 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2778324 wayne does eat and drink more than any of the other lads and some say that might be why he was the only one who was ill
2778325 theo is ready to take on more responsibility he has the support from the fans the club and his team mates
2778326 he is one of the best players in the squad
2778327 i came because the premier league is the strongest in the world and i am playing for one of the strongest teams
2778328 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2778329 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2778330 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2778331 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player
2778332 a partir desse resultado vamos ver quais s o as for as pol ticas e a estrutura de poder que se constituir
2778333 the gap from certain clubs will always be there logically every side must use the resources they are able to generate
2778334 we too have spent money and have the opportunity to offer contracts that many other clubs cannot afford
2778335 there are clubs ahead of us but lets not forget there are many behind us too
2778336 we took him out a little early the other night
2778337 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was getting hard to get loose he was still throwing great
2778338 were trying to not have this thing get to the point where it did last year
2778339 they said more than likely i wouldnt beat it so theres kind of no point to go through with it and that more than likely it would be a waste of time
2778340 even if youre not guilty the evidence is too strong against you to have a chance
2778341 so that the worse that could happen is what happens instead of 10 days it probably wont set me back too much
2778342 real bad joses an unbelievable guy his injury is not an easy one

2778350 i think im going to hire someone in indianapolis to break his leg
2778351 just joking if it happens its not me im not that kind of person i want to compete on the track
2778352 when i was going into turn three i thought i got it like im finally going to win this race
2778353 and all of a sudden im coming out of turn four all of a sudden the car just coughed
2778354 there is only one thing going right for one car only and thats scott dixon
2778355 i was very happy because i would have finished sixth or eighth or 10th and with a second place its very good
2778356 the championship it aint over yet well still continue working hard
2778357 definitely with sonoma and chicago and belle isle tracks that those guys are very good at as well we are going to make sure we dont lose too many points

2778362 muchas veces la fiscal a recibe denuncias inherentes a nuestra competencia tales como las referidas al abuso policial los excesos de algunos cuerpos uniformados del estado y el tema de los servicios p blicos que tambi n nos compete por tanto nos hemos propuesto una labor de difusi n y de mauyor presencia de nuestros defensores en la calle para que la gente realmente cual es el rol de nuestra defensor a
2778363 aunque lo m s importantes en estos casos es la vinculaci n directa de los ciudadanos y ciudadanas en la resoluci n de sus problemas pero s funciona la labor de la defensor a cuando en una mesa de trabajo act a como puente con otras instituciones para lograr problemas de las comunidades
2778364 ellos le pueden predicar a sus pares lo que es el derecho a los derechos humanos e iniciamos en el estado miranda un programa de formaci n directamente a los estudiantes quienes est n en proceso de aprendizaje
2778365 hasta ahora los cuerpos que hemos visitado no hemos observado resistencia pr ximamente estaremos en la polic a de aragua y esta semana presentar como una iniciativa de la defensor a la ley contra la tortura que se estableci en la constituyente y no se hab a legislado en esa materia la hemos venido trabajando con la red de apoyo por la justicia y la paz y esperamos que se llene un vac o aunque no lo es todo porque es necesaria la pr ctica pero mientras m s flancos ataquemos vamos a ir desterrando esa cultura en el seno de las nuevas generaciones de funcionarios
2778366 en los trabajos que hemos realizado en los barrios los vecinos refieren las ventas de licores durante los fines de semana y como los expendios de licor que los llevan los mismos vecinos derivan en fiestas y tambi n por la cantidad de armas creemos se debe avanzar en un plan nacional de desarme sabemos que se han hecho esfuerzos pero no han prosperado
2778367 lo m s importante a nuestro juicio para abordar la inseguridad es avanzar en el desarme de la poblaci n
2778368 la coordinaci n con los entes competentes lo estamos haciendo de manera muy modesta desde la c rcel y ya el presidente llam al vicepresidente para comenzar a gestionar el tema de los indultos
2778369 las criticas contra estas leyes son pol ticas porque hasta ahora no he escuchado ninguna cr tica s lida que pueda hacer pensar que ellas est n re idas con la constituci n sobre la ley de la fan estuve escuchando al vicepresidente de que se trata de una ley mucho m s incluyente estas leyes son una deuda que vienen a darle sentido al andamiaje constitucional en caso de revisi n para hacerlas m s perfectibles para eso est la an puede iniciarse un proceso para explicarlas para conocer el alcance de stas nosotros como defensor a el ministerio p blico y adem s que son perfectibles
2778370 having to leave my fathers deathbed so that some guy with an ice box could shuck his eyes out while they were fresh still makes me sick and furious to this day
2778371 what signal does it send when the government is hauling one of the big accounting firms into the grand jury room over tax fraud while handing that same company millions of dollars in taxpayer funded contracts
2778372 the rewards of a successful marketing of the opis product and the competitive disadvantages which may result from registration far exceed the financial exposure to penalties that may arise
2778373 the h r representative said she admittedly didnt know much about the disease but she was going to do her best to learn rogers said nothing
2778374 she said it as if she was angry with me
2778375 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
2778376 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
2778377 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
2778378 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
2778379 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
2778380 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
2778381 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

2778427 since graduating from utc with my art degree in 2003 my work has focused mainly on structures that were slated for demolition i am attempting to shift gradually from those spaces that no longer exist and their impermanence to those that have up to this moment survived in this series of oil paintings there are still a few structures that were torn down but most of the places have been restored and are still standing perhaps this refers to my own aging process and my personal attempts to continue to improve and sustain myself

2778429 we have two more states that we need to get done new york and massachusetts canada is very important to us very important to us after we get new york and massachusetts done were moving up into canada and opening up places in canada probably toronto first
2778430 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
2778431 a friend of the earth manages to be funny and touching antic and affecting all at the same time though mr boyle sends up tys countercultural excesses with his usual sardonic glee he also manages to make the psychological underpinnings of his fervor palpable and real more important he also manages to make the consequences of tys radicalism the real focus of this novel turning the books four decade long narrative into a long sad funny unnerving account of tys efforts to come to terms with the fallout of his actions w hile mr boys humor is black as ever he demonstrates in telling tys story that satire can coexist with psychological realism comedy with compassion
2778432 a friend of the earth is a profoundly and perhaps intentionally depressing book it presents us with a vision of the earth in the near future a devastated planet the authors tone is not one of compassion nor even of world weary pity there is too much exuberance for that as an image of the difficulty of relating to others and of continuing to be human even in such desperate circumstances as here predicted for us a friend of the earth is a success
2778433 most of the themes that boyle entertains here the consequences of american excess and media hype the vagaries of class the macho males secret fear of women have appeared in his fiction before but here he sets himself the challenge of using his impressive arsenal of literary tricks and tropes in the service of a more earnest exploration the ecological d day he posits is compelling and complex progress boyle tells us is never a clear climb this assured novel gives us haunting images to prove the point
2778434 the prose startles with vivid simile with literary circumlocution the story careens along with the breathless authority of a roller coaster step in and youll be jounced dizzied thrilled and surprised by this thing youve given yourself up to boyle has long been celebrated for his comic genius for his mastery of that side of the classic antinomy he explores here in a friend of the earth he sets himself a new challenge swinging a leg wide to plant a foot solidly on new ground his work is the richer and more affecting for it part antic comedy part ecological intelligencer part heartfelt plaint a friend of the earth is a comic novel on grievous themes a serious exploration of tragic truths it not only marks boyles progress as a literary talent but demonstrates his consistent ability to entertain
2778435 boyle can put his nimble mind to honest work nevertheless with its slack plotting motiveless characters and unfruitful time shifting a friend of the earth is a ragged uninspired effort from this gifted writer although tricked out in fancy prose both global catastrophe and one familys painful struggle remain unaffecting
2778436 edwards is no longer an elected official and he is not running for office now dont expect wall to wall coverage
2778437 el gol fue una muy buena jugada de ellos la hicieron bien nos empataron ni modo ahora ya debemos dejarlo atr s
2778438 lamentablemente nos empatan al final aunque pienso que se jug bien tuvimos llegadas no las pudimos concretar pero hay que tratar de olvidar lo que pas y ya pensar en toluca que es lo que sigue
2778439 pienso que el equipo se plant bien en el terreno de juego lamentablemente no se han estado dando los resultados pero sabemos que se est trabajando muy bien y pronto se van a dar creo que ante toluca se puede dar
2778440 esperemos que en la selecci n le vaya bien al compa ero y que la rompa tambi n all y siga con ese esmero que le vemos cada partido
2778441 me va bien tranquilo porque estoy marcando seguido creo que debo seguir trabajando bien y con la fe en dios que en lo personal salga de aqu para adelante muy bien espero seguir trabajando de buena manera
2778442 a mi viejo pap estaba ah sentado y vieron que le hice algunos cachos ademanes se lo dediqu a l primera vez que me ve jugando en el exterior y me pongo contento as que se lo dediqu a l
2778443 creo que mi pap est muy contento porque es la primera vez que sale del pa s se le hizo el sue o realidad y con un gol m s todav a creo que eso nos debe poner feliz a todos nosotros y debemos seguir de alguna manera y de aqu para adelante marcar muchos goles y para que le den triunfos a la instituci n
2778444 creo que el equipo jug bien por ah no se lleg mucho luego en el segundo tiempo llegaron los goles igual no nos podemos relajar no podemos caer en ese exceso de confianza tenemos que seguir trabajando creo que la mentalidad de nosotros es sa seguir trabajando duro y ojal que de aqu para adelante sea por mucho tiempo
2778445 who knows but that on the lower frequencies i speak for you
2778446 uno siempre quiere jugar de arranque pero bueno la decisi n del t cnico me parece tambi n justa porque el equipo hab a ganado tambi n y hab a hecho bien las cosas
2778447 entonces es dif cil cambiar al equipo pero bueno cuando no tiene la oportunidad trata de no desaprovecharla y por suerte hoy salieron bien las cosas ten a ganas yo creo que todos ten amos ganas y seguir trabajando para m s como hoy
2778448 el equipo en general estuvo bien porque si bien los goles no se dieron en el primer tiempo se dieron en el segundo pero el equipo siempre fue buscando el triunfo trat de sacar esa ventaja del segundo tiempo pero contento porque en general se hizo un lindo trabajo
2778449 s dieron varios golpes por ah pero no pasa nada son cosas del futbol as que nada por suerte estoy bien
2778450 s por suerte se dio un lindo partido pero hay que seguir ya si bien la pr xima fecha no se juega tenemos m s de una semana para seguir trabajando y seguir corrigiendo cosas pero feliz por lo de hoy
2778451 s eso merma un poco tu trabajo porque pues nosotros metimos un gol y ellos hab an fallado la penal pero no pasa nada suceden este tipo de errores a lo mejor el rbitro estaba bien en repetirlo a lo mejor no igual hay que seguir trabajando
2778452 la verdad es que ya lo hab a estudiado sab a que ramoncito morales lo iba a tirar cruzado en el segundo ya dud un poco porque precisamente ya la hab a fallado hacia ese mismo lado la verdad decid volver a ir pero ahora le peg m s fuerte y con m s direcci n desgraciadamente no pude llegar pero no pasa de ah lo importante es que tuvimos mejor funcionamiento y que seguimos mejorando
2778453 no nos vamos satisfechos pero s tranquilos por el funcionamiento del equipo aspir bamos a un poco m s merec amos el triunfo porque propusimos tuvimos m s llegadas que chivas desafortunadamente no se pudo
2778454 anot pero eso no importa me siento contento porque el equipo gan a m nunca me importa qui n meta los goles el equipo gan y sobre todo que se mostr bien los compa eros hicieron un gran partido un gran trabajo y el equipo se muestra cada vez m s s lido
2778455 falta mucho apenas van tres partidos y estamos trabajando muy fuerte porque ac no hemos ganado nada
2778456 siempre va a ser bonito muy padre meter un gol siempre tratar de buscarlo el estar ah pero m s all de eso hay cosas m s arriba otros objetivos m s arriba de qui n meta un gol como es ganar un partido ya sea con un autogol que sea como sea
2778457 ahora estoy contento por eso porque el equipo gan y nunca perdi la concentraci n
2778458 no eso no es cierto risas mis compa eros hicieron un gran trabajo y como te digo aqu en este equipo no hay figuras es un equipo donde todos tratamos de colaborar al mil por ciento
2778459 yo siempre lo voy a pensar y hoy estoy muy contento por el esfuerzo el trabajo y la actitud que muestran mis compa eros cada vez es mejor la verdad me da much sima confianza y much sima seguridad al verlos jugar y trataremos de seguir mejorando
2778460 son partidos que se tienen que trabajar desde el primer minuto tienes que ir picando piedra tienes que ir taladrando porque el rival es muy dif cil y tuvimos la fortuna de encontrar el primer gol
2778461 despu s se pudo manejar mejor el partido pero la base de mis compa eros tambi n muy s lidos a la defensiva nos da much sima confianza el no recibir gol y mantener una concentraci n
2778462 la verdad que no se jug bien no estamos conformes ni con el resultado ni con el funcionamiento no fuimos los de otros partidos as que nos vamos muy tristes y con muchas cosas para mejorar
2778463 realmente no tuvimos la inercia de los partidos anteriores nos cost llegar al arco nos llegaron mucho y en el segundo tiempo no pudimos rebuscar y el rival nos gan bastante bien
2778464 el t cnico dijo que le pareci eso pero seguramente ya m s tranquilos y en la semana hay muchas cosas para corregir para volver a ser el equipo que fuimos los dos partidos anteriores
2778465 no igual con lo que no nos pas bien en cada llegada no fuimos el equipo que ven amos siendo en el segundo tiempo el rival nos hizo el primero no supimos rebuscar y nos cost no mantener la calma y poder dar vuelta al resultado
2778466 qu puedo decir no lo esper bamos para nada este marcador pero la forma de revertir es trabajando y analizando lo que hemos dejado de hacer
2778467 la verdad no lo esper bamos trabajamos toda la semana para tener otro marcador pero bueno a seguir trabajando no hay m s
2778468 son jugadores importantes que aportan bastante pero hay m s jugadores que lo hacen muy bien y nosotros hacemos las cosas para estar mejor

2778485 in the days leading up to ohio and texas the campaign kept arguing over whether to air the 3 a
2778486 they proposed that clinton from a position of strength immediately after her wins challenge obama to accept michigan and florida revotes such a move preempts obamas reiteration on march 5 that they are still up 100 plus delegates and that we cant win they noted the press will love the rematch like rocky ii
2778487 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2778488 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel

2778492 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2778493 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2778494 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2778495 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2778496 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2778497 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2778498 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2778499 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2778645 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
2778646 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
2778647 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
2778648 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2778649 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2778650 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2778651 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2778652 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2778653 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2778654 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2778655 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years

2778670 i recount all this now because it illustrates the perverse nature of fannie and freddie that has made them such a relentless and untouchable political force their unique clout derives from a combination of liberal ideology and private profit the abiding lesson here is what happens when you combine private property with government power you create political monsters that are protected both by journalists on the left and pseudo capitalists on wall street by liberal democrats and country club republicans even now after all the dishonesty and failure fannie and freddie could emerge from this taxpayer rescue more powerful than ever

2778785 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2778786 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2778787 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2778788 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2778789 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2778790 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2778791 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2778792 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2778793 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2778794 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2778795 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2778796 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not

2778809 i thought we could have won it sometimes you win sometimes you lose they came back they hit a great shot give them credit
2778810 if you consider this loss its not that important but its emotionally important it puts a lot of pressure on you in the next game and the following one so were going to have to play great and really step up
2778811 it was great we won the game we really feel good about that but there is still a long way to go
2778812 we cant get too rattled in the beginning with good streaks
2778813 if we get worried it wont help us we have to keep that in mind from here on out
2778814 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere
2778815 it was tough in the beginning but we managed to improve and get the win
2778816 we played very good defense and forced them to lose many balls that was the key to our victory it will help give us confidence
2778817 it was a great game a very important game for us
2778818 it was our defense and the running game those were the keys to the win
2778819 we missed a lot of free throws and we made some easy mistakes that made it easy for spain to control the game were going to try the next game not to give that present
2778820 it was a good start we had a little pressure on us but overall it went pretty well

2778946 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2778947 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2778948 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2778949 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2778950 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2778951 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2778952 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2778953 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2778954 why cant you just feel sexy at home its ridiculous to think you can go to a club where people are drunk dressed hotly and not expect men to be aroused
2778955 i can no longer continue writing my placeblog about the same place
2778956 it rained my helmet communication knocked out i had to call a couple of my own plays i completed maybe two passes so it wasnt the best start
2778957 our expectations are high we cant hold the offense hostage to youth
2778958 we expect our guys to play well does that mean theyre going to go out there and be all pros the first time out no and we expect them to continue to play better in october and december as well
2778959 the no 1 thing we want these guys to do is take care of the football and make smart decisions and manage the game do we anticipate that every throw is going to be perfect and right on the money no but we expect them to if theres a protection adjustment to be made if theres a blitz that occurs we expect them to know how to respond
2778960 my plan all along with brian and matt has been that we have a window to prepare them for the season i really dont get caught up in what ifs and whos out there thats not my thought process im focused on the players that are here those two quarterbacks will be ready to play when their time is called upon and its the responsibility of the coaching staff and the players to get that done
2778961 they always say the next game is the most important game so it will be monday night here at lambeau
2778962 but when you play in a game like the west virginia game third in the nation against fifth in the nation on thursday night theres a lot on the line theres not as much on the line this game
2778963 i just want to execute the offense did i make the right checks did i make the right run calls did i throw the ball to the right guy thats what i want to see when i watch the film the next day but the first time out there preseason game at lambeau against an opponent on a monday night its going to be a good atmosphere its definitely going to be exciting i cant wait to get out there
2778964 its been a long time since i played a game and im excited its what you play the game for the games
2778965 ive spent a lot of time in the playbook and watching aaron and seeing how he runs things ive definitely gotten a lot more comfortable when youre up to the line of scrimmage and your brains not scrambling as much and youre not thinking about everything as much you can kind of react and be a little calmer and make different checks and protection calls its getting a lot more fun its slowing down for me
2778966 the thing is you can try to simulate the game speed in practice but its a notch higher even in preseason and then even a notch higher in the regular season
2778967 theyre going to have to be ready to make quick decisions but slow things down in their own minds as well
2778968 well probably put in the 3 4 defense for monday night put that in for the game monday
2778969 if i need to go a few more snaps i will
2778970 my only concern is the health of the football team
2778971 every decision will really be based on the health because i would like to see them all play
2778972 its important for us to get some momentum to get out there and play some live football you dont want to be going through the preseason and feel like you have work that needs to be done in games three and four but they will clearly be health issues
2778973 it felt real good being back out there with my teammates
2778974 i was a little bit rusty at first after taking two weeks off but im good now and ready to go
2778975 when youre not playing you have to look at the guys on the field watch a lot of film and sort of put yourself in their shoes

2778997 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2778998 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2778999 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2779000 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments

2779003 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2779004 bushs basic conception of a global war on terror to take but the most obvious example has been poorly thought through badly implemented and has produced many unintended costs that will linger for years if not decades but blanket criticism of bush misses an important reality
2779005 whatever reasons and through whichever path the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream in many cases the next president should follow rather than reverse them
2779006 in the last few years many of these policies have been modified abandoned or reversed this has happened without acknowledgment which is partly what drives critics crazy and its often been done surreptitiously it doesnt reflect a change of heart so much as an admission of failure the old way simply wasnt working

2779018 this is an issue which has to be dealt with carefully because while trying to solve this issue we should not do anything which will give solace to one part and create problem in another part of the state we would like to evolve a formula which is acceptable to all the sides

2779090 we have worked too hard with constituents and community leaders on important legislation just to see it die at the hands of political gamesmanship
2779091 the good news is the governors actions wont stop quality legislation from moving forward it will just slow down the process
2779092 democrat leadership insists on raising billions of dollars in taxes and thats an idea republican and moderate democrats wont support
2779093 if the majority party believes they have the support of a super majority they should bring the budget bill to the senate and assembly floors for a vote
2779094 an attack on the secretariat is an attack on the institution
2779095 i was assured no economic blockade shall be allowed and every effort will be made to keep the highway open

2779098 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2779099 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2779100 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2779101 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2779102 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2779103 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2779104 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2779105 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2779106 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2779107 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2779108 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2779109 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2779110 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2779111 the suicide bomber struck after the u s soldiers responded

2779114 we want to make sure that theyre not landing on some site that would make us blanch
2779115 when i let her know that i understood and heard what she was saying i think that was important to her
2779116 as a consequence of my books doing well suddenly its easier to get takeout whenever we feel like it its easier to get a housekeeper to come in one or two days to help do the laundry or help clean up its easier to do a lot of things that frankly the vast majority of american women cant afford but were not that far removed from the situation where this work was falling on her in a very heavy way

2779158 since the burmese military has ignored the call of the internal national community to begin an inclusive political process and unilaterally imposed a constitution designed to consolidate military rule it is imperative to review the international approach towards burma
2779159 a full blown castigation of the burmese generals could have caused considerable discomfort for bangkok which has just assumed the chair of asean which includes burma
2779160 who are they to say im offending community standards when they have none to begin with

2779173 why are the finnish and swedish teams planning a new multinational league
2779174 bo lennartsson f rjestads bks director of development states that the teams are looking into their options due to economic pressure he states that the teams also fear of turning into developmental teams of developmental leagues while the nhl and the newly formed khl function as proper hockey leagues
2779175 kalervo kummola the vice president of iihf and the president of the finnish ice hockey association claims that the plan is doomed and that iihf would ban the member teams from international competitions
2779176 one thing is clear it is speculative whether a nordic league will be formed in the near future however the possibility of this happening is now probably the highest as nhl and khl teams pump more money into luring players the sheer economic pressure is forcing the scandinavian teams to weigh their options a new cross league between the finnish and swedish top teams might get more media attention more big sponsors and a better television contract
2779177 will new sponsors keep supporting the league if no one will see their advertisements
2779178 three california born players have been selected in each of the last two nhl drafts including mitch wahl of long beach 48th overall to calgary max nicastro of thousand oaks 91st overall to detroit and colin long of santa ana 99th to phoenix this past june

2779192 the lord of the rings the return of the king
2779193 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2779194 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2779195 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2779196 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2779197 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2779198 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
2779199 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
2779200 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
2779201 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
2779202 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
2779203 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
2779204 we had to work no matter how hot it was no matter how much it rained from 5 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon sometimes we could only afford rice porridge
2779205 its my destiny to be poor if i had another daughter id ask her to marry a foreigner
2779206 taiwanese women want to get married when they are much older and they are also very opinionated
2779207 no one ever came on our trip without finding their dream bride
2779208 they take hundreds of women at a time to a hotel and line them up for the men
2779209 there wont be anyone left for us marriage shouldnt be about money it should be about love

2779211 who are they kashmiri leaders to decide our fate they are the ones who created the problem
2779212 we are not going to meet them they invited us for a meeting at 11 am but it seems they are not interested after keeping us waiting for more than an hour
2779213 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2779214 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2779215 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2779216 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2779217 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2779218 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2779219 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2779220 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2779221 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2779222 russias president dmitry medvedev said that moscow sent troops into south ossetia to protect its peacekeepers and civilians on a mission to
2779223 russian officials said they werent targeting civilians but russias foreign minister sergey lavrov said that
2779224 its regrettable that russian civilians and troops were killed when georgia tried to assert their legitimate authority in south ossetia
2779225 i came here to boost the moral of our fruit growers as fruit industry has suffered huge losses with the corers of rupees fruit rotting in kashmir
2779226 i appeal people of frontier towns to come out and cross the bloody line of control that have made us hostage in our homeland
2779227 our muzzafarabad cahlo program is intact we are ready with our fruit laden trucks to march towards muzzafarabad on monday and there is massive public support for our move
2779228 presently there seems to be no option other than the alternative route of muzzafarabad to export our fruit and save the fruit industry
2779229 20 percent of the american dining public are socially maladjusted psychopaths
2779230 a new peace formula has been put forth to end the deadlock
2779231 we will compensate the victims of the violence we will compensate the near and dear ones of those who have been killed
2779232 the ouster of azad and abdullah soz and mehbooba mufti from the meeting of the all party delegation shows the unique strength of the people
2779233 the ouster of the congress pdp and nc leaders from the meeting is a clear signal that such communal leaders have no place whatsoever in the secular and tolerant jammu and that they must refrain from vitiating the communal amity and remarkable unity by coming to jammu
2779234 rioters hired from outside the state are perpetrating violence and oppression on the muslims of jammu under a deep conspiracy while communal leader dinesh bharti is openly spewing venom against muslims
2779235 this situation has arisen because of the criminal negligence of the government in new delhi and the events of 1947 are being repeated
2779236 on the same day people from muzaffarabad will head for srinagar with essential supplies and life saving drugs
2779237 people from poonch and other muslim dominated areas of jammu will also march for rawalakot
2779238 anything you can do we certainly appreciate it it does make a difference
2779239 what happens here is going to echo across the country

2779300 membunuh satu orang saja dosanya sudah banyak apalagi lebih dari satu pokoknya saya siap membantu dia untuk tobat
2779301 memang antara ryan dengan fpi tidak ada kaitannya sama sekali tapi karena dia sesama muslim kami terpanggil untuk membimbing dan membina mentalnya kembali ke jalan yang benar

2779305 frechheit 2 50 f r jede karte versand obwohl anders angegeben nie wieder
2779306 4 doppel tickets statt 1x 1 45 porto 4x 2 50 gt
2779307 sie k nnen ihr db ebay ticket nicht umtauschen oder erstatten lassen bitte haben sie aufgrund der besonderen konditionen des angebots verst ndnis daf r
2779308 nach meiner berzeugung kann sich die bahn hierauf aber nicht berufen da es sich bei den tickets praktisch um gutscheine handelt die keine konkrete fahrt zum gegenstand haben
2779309 die bahn verweigert das widerrufsrecht hier also zu unrecht wir werden die bahn daher abmahnen auch die tatsache dass die karten nach dem 31 10 2008 erstattungslos verfallen sollen halte ich rechtlich f r unzul ssig auch deswegen werden wir die bahn abmahnen
2779310 zurzeit ist es bei ebay nur m glich zehn identische artikel gleichzeitig einzustellen
2779311 wir k nnen nachvollziehen dass sich ein bieter rgert wenn er das gleiche ticket sp ter g nstiger erh lt

2779316 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2779317 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2779318 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2779319 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2779320 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2779321 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2779322 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it

2779356 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2779357 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2779358 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2779359 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2779360 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2779361 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
2779362 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2779363 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2779364 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of
2779365 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2779366 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2779367 wasnt a personal trip over there to go to caesars palace and play
2779368 he believes it was the right thing to do and on the spur of the moment he just went

2779375 to find someone you can be yourself around who makes you laugh who challenges you in a good way and where you can just speak off each other
2779376 in late 2003 and 2004 according to box office tracker media by numbers
2779377 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2779378 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2779379 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2779380 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2779381 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2779382 tend to pick up stories from the national enquirer with tongs
2779383 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
2779384 its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this sex may sell but it can really hurt your relationship with readers
2779385 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story
2779386 it was just a matter of were not going to put something on the air until we know that its true
2779387 we were able to prove i think with satisfaction to our bosses that there was money being paid to rielle hunter
2779388 this began to be for us an aspect of something we could report some hard facts
2779389 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying
2779390 but it became a ludicrous situation almost became a conspiracy of silence by the media and edwards meanwhile would not give interviews was not acting like a man who didnt have something to hide
2779391 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
2779392 i was taught when i was a young reporter that its news when we say it is i think thats still true its news when we say it is its just who we is has changed
2779393 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
2779394 my grandfather collected for years to see this church built at the time in 1916 this was a poor mining village but everyone gave something i have been a member of this church all my life i was born into the parish and i never thought i would live to see the day when this church closed
2779395 i think its disgusting we have a strong congregation and an excellent priest we are self sufficient there is no need to close us down
2779396 my dad was buried here me and my sister were married here and our children were baptised here they are splitting up a family by closing this church were all devastated
2779397 i think we have one of the best linebacker corps in the league and it shows
2779398 whether you see it from a backup or on special teams whoever is out there can contribute and thats a strength that was shown tonight
2779399 i was just trying to make some plays and work on my pass rushing
2779400 everyone was on the same page as long as we stay like that throughout the season i feel like we can be a championship team
2779401 they come in and do a great job for us and its always good to have depth we have a lot of depth at linebacker on this team and that showed up tonight
2779402 this is one of the worst moments of my career
2779403 well were out of luck boys there is no fence

2779454 some forward movement and very positive messages relayed to gay and lesbian members
2779455 the core being of gay or lesbian is no longer a sin in and of itself
2779456 a lot of us in affirmation see that as great progress
2779457 slowly coming that direction change in the smallest form does take time but i believe members are starting to understand its not inherently a sin just to be gay
2779458 was a little rough over course of time and many many discussions my family has come to fully accept me for who i am it has basically turned into a non issue with me and my extended family im very very fortunate

2779479 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2779480 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2779481 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2779482 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2779483 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2779484 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2779485 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2779486 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2779487 clark and key have spoken with one voice on this matter the national party has no agenda no plans other than to be in government

2779495 what was happened in united states with lots of races live in a city is that they could live in peace no such conflicts between black white asian or others but what we should concern is the fact that they had their culture unify dont have their own identity and in other cities what happened were the opposite chinese people live in their own community black people live in their hood and white people live in their community too and in these cities people between races mock each other so which for us to choose to be a nation with united people without leaving their cultural identity
2779496 a better multicultural education should be applied today in this globalization era where the people will face more strangers more strange values the strangers will bring more conflicts if they still havent applied the better multicultural education

2779554 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2779555 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

2779558 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2779559 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2779560 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2779561 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2779593 incidentally just so that this point isnt lost in the deliberately confusing reportage
2779594 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2779595 its something akin to martial law in that particular area
2779596 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
2779597 in a way i like it because they shot up my house too
2779598 and in a way i dont like it because a few minutes ago i had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what i was doing and where i was going
2779599 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
2779600 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
2779601 notwithstanding the city code and curfew order the residents of helena west helenahave the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard to ride their bicycles along the streets protest this policy and drive around the city with the full protections of the first fourth and fourteenth amendments
2779602 i invite them to move in on second street and be up all nightwith people shooting at them
2779603 since this began its more quiet and peaceful around here
2779604 i think theyre doing a wonderful job prior to this the kids were dealing drugs right in the middle of the street stopping cars saying hey hey what you got
2779605 you couldnt walk down the streets your little kids couldnt either we were just that scared
2779606 youre not free and youre supposed to be free you cant go outside and walk the streets look the entire area is empty theres nobody out here

2779618 viele menschen die zum ersten mal durch den tunnel fahren wollen sehen wann sie den tiefsten punkt erreicht haben
2779619 wir gehen davon aus dass die t ter mit den fahrzeugen noch in der nacht nach osteuropa gerast sind
2779620 vor einem jahr wog ich noch 72 kilo und trug kleidergr e 42
2779621 ich habe meine ern hrung dauerhaft umgestellt kein weizenmehl kein zucker stattdessen viel gem se fisch und obst und nur noch dunkle schokolade
2779622 ich trug einen lycra schaumstoff anzug der extra f r mich angefertigt wurde und einer gr e 46 entsprach
2779623 es geht darum dass wir frauen eigentlich grunds tzlich denken dass wir nicht d nn genug sind
2779624 kaum eine frau kann sich diesem druck entziehen selbst ich f hlte mich noch mit einer gr e 38 lange zu dick denn gerade im schauspielbusiness sollen frauen nun mal sch n schlank sein
2779625 als ich jung war hatte ich einige freundinnen die an bulimie oder magersucht litten
2779626 wir schaffen uns eine k nstliche welt magazinfotos werden teilweise so lange bearbeitet bis eine frau absolut perfekt aussieht auf solchen bildern erkenne ich mich manchmal selbst nicht wieder
2779627 que color tiene este ossobuco y que brillo muy buena

2779631 meinen sie ich k nnte mit 37 menschenleben auf dem gewissen noch ruhig schlafen
2779632 die russen stehen vor den toren zugdidis die stadt wird evakuiert
2779633 nicht die georgier haben angefangen die russen haben diesen konflikt gewollt ihn provoziert sie haben nur einen anlass gesucht um ber unser land herfallen zu k nnen
2779634 glaubt den russen nicht die behaupten auch sie h tten nicht eine bombe auf georgisches territorium geworfen dabei ist schon die h lfte des landes getroffen
2779635 ich war noch klein aber ich kann mich erinnern wie alle georgier 1993 aus der region vertrieben wurden ber die berge mussten wir fliehen auf uns wurde geschossen wir hatten angst um unser leben
2779636 wer glaubt hier geht es um s dossetien der irrt
2779637 aber mein bruder mein vater meine schwangere schwester sie sind alle noch da
2779638 es ist wahnsinn dazu hat putin doch kein recht wir haben so lange daf r gek mpft dass georgien frei und unabh ngig ist
2779639 da sagte er wir werden alles tun um das zu verhindern jetzt
2779640 warum krieg ist weil die interessen der usa und die russlands bei uns aufeinanderprallen georgien ist geopolitisch enorm wichtig
2779641 die die in abchasien und in s dossetien das sagen haben sind marionetten moskaus die menschen da wollen keinen krieg mit georgien
2779642 es steht die existenz georgiens auf dem spiel ich finde der westen muss uns endlich helfen notfalls auch milit risch sonst l schen putin amp co uns aus
2779643 que color tiene este ossobuco y que brillo muy buena
2779644 wir versuchen nach kr ften hier probleme zu vermeiden und den transport so sicher wie m glich zu machen wir sind aber auf hinweise unser kunden angewiesen
2779645 mir ist aufgefallen dass es in hamburg viele alte geb ude gibt das gef llt mir sehr gut besonders das rathaus finde ich wundersch n zu hause wurden die alten h user im krieg leider alle zerst rt bei den hamburgern f llt mir auf dass sie weniger gestresst sind als meine landsleute in china dort gibt es im berufsleben viel mehr druck hier ist das leben viel entspannter
2779646 ich bin seit januar in hamburg am besten gef llt mir der fischmarkt ich mag die atmosph re die vielen st nde und den kontakt zu den h ndlern ein bisschen erinnert er mich auch an zu hause obwohl die m rkte dort viel gr er sind leider schlie t der fischmarkt zu fr h ich bin n mlich eigentlich langschl fer an hamburg aufgefallen ist mir auch dass die u bahnen hier nicht so voll sind wie bei uns und das ist sehr angenehm
2779647 mein lieblingsplatz in hamburg sind spitalerstra e und m nckebergstra e weil ich hier so gut shoppen kann es gibt viele tolle klamottenl den an hamburg gef llt mir aber auch dass man berall natur findet und der ffentliche verkehr gut geregelt ist es ist allerdings schade dass ich w hrend olympia nicht in china bin aber ich werde viel im tv angucken
2779648 leider st rt der zunehmende mond die abendliche sicht auf die sternschnuppen
2779649 erstes und h chstwahrscheinlich einziges doppel live album mit dvd
2779650 ich wurde berfallen ohne mein hausnotrufger t am handgelenk w re ich vielleicht nicht mit einem blauen auge davongekommen
2779651 er schubste mich in die wohnung ich fiel hin und dann schlug er mit seinem schuh auf mich ein
2779652 und war nicht in der lage eine aussage zu machen
2779653 und da stellte sich heraus dass der schl ssel zu der wohnung genau gegen ber von herrn k passt
2779654 mein vater hat eine sch delprellung und einen gro en schreck wir werden den mann wegen k rperverletzung anzeigen
2779655 zwei mit links zwei mit rechts jetzt kommt der kopf
2779656 st rmer sind dazu da um tore zu schie en
2779657 eine wiedergekehrte krankheit namens angio dem hat mich dazu gezwungen die schwierige entscheidung zu f llen und mich vom tourleben mit den dead kennedys zu verabschieden trotzdem ich werde mich nicht aus der musik zur ckziehen
2779658 aber wir k nnen nicht zu viel auf einmal machen sonst wird er langsamer
2779659 nur mit einem erfahrenen trainer der erkannt hat welches system ich spielen lasse konnte der hsv diese partie gewinnen
2779660 bis dahin hat ingolstadt vieles gut und wir einiges falsch gemacht
2779661 so was habe ich in all den jahren w hrend meiner karriere noch nie erlebt mindestens einen habe ich immer gehalten
2779662 vier von f nf dingern haben die unter die latte gejagt das war schon ziemlich gut
2779663 ja ich glaube es ist gut gelaufen f r mich
2779664 es war ein typisches torwart spiel b lle halten flanken fangen rauslaufen
2779665 nur nach ihren angriffen waren die auer kurz offen ansonsten standen die tief und kompakt hinten drin selbst als sie in berzahl waren
2779666 aufgrund dessen was er in aue gezeigt hat haben wir ihn ja auch geholt
2779667 zu hause reden wir nicht italienisch aber ich liebe die lebensart meine oma macht die beste pasta
2779668 die lasagne meiner mama ist die beste und die maccheroni von meiner tante
2779669 daf r muss ich aber zwei jahre in der liga sein vielleicht am ende meiner karriere
2779670 peter war der einzige den ich kannte als ich nach hamburg gekommen bin wir haben uns bei einem sommer hockey turnier getroffen das war sehr lustig
2779671 aber dass ich jetzt nicht mehr auf italienisch fluchen kann ist schon ziemlich bl d
2779672 dass wir so deutlich gewinnen war nicht zu erwarten zum gl ck haben wir nach der pause das 3 1 gemacht danach wurde es leichter das war ein sehr guter einstand
2779673 unser ziel war ein sieg dass er so hoch ausgefallen ist ist umso sch ner
2779674 vincent kompany wird am montag zur ckfliegen wir haben es ihm mitgeteilt
2779675 wir haben eine klare abmachung getroffen vincent durfte zwei spiele bleiben dann sollte er zur ckkommen wenn wir ihn brauchen am dienstag erwarte ich ihn
2779676 ich werde all meine berredungsk nste einsetzen um hierbleiben zu k nnen
2779677 als wir unsere abmachung trafen hatten wir andere voraussetzungen ich hoffe ich kann meinen trainer berzeugen denn ich m chte dieses turnier zu ende spielen
2779678 sie d rfen gerne zwischen den einzelnen st cken applaudieren damit g nnen sie mir eine kleine erholungspause
2779679 aber als es dann gut lief hat die anspannung nachgelassen
2779680 ich hatte mir extra vorgenommen nicht zu schreien aber der biss tat ziemlich weh
2779681 wir werden diese saison wohl finanziell zu ende spielen k nnen
2779682 dann folgt die analyse wenn die stadt und sponsoren sich nicht bewegen geht es nicht weiter
2779683 wenn man in drei wettbewerben spielen will braucht man auch spieler
2779684 man hat im vorjahr bei n rnberg gesehen was passieren kann obwohl wir sicher st rker besetzt sind als die
2779685 ein breiter kader ist wichtig es w re gut wenn zwei leute kommen
2779686 man kann auch mit wenig mitteln etwas erreichen das hat didi oft gezeigt
2779687 der sieg war wichtig jetzt sind wir im turnier drin
2779688 das war ein geiles gef hl und der sch nste treffer meines lebens
2779689 wenn man gegen profis klar zur ckliegt l t sich halt nichts machen
2779690 its a very complex machine this is a step towards getting ready
2779691 a nightmarish situation that can still be hoped to be averted in time through communication within the scientific community is drawn attention to only a few weeks remain to find out whether the danger is real or nothing but a mirage after this time window is closed it will take years until we know whether or not we are doomed the story line has all the features of a best selling novel the reader is asked to contribute constructively
2779692 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2779693 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2779694 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2779695 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2779696 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2779697 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2779698 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2779699 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2779700 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2779701 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2779702 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2779703 mit elf mann h tten wir das spiel sicherlich nicht verloren
2779704 das war doof von mir dadurch habe ich die mannschaft geschw cht
2779705 aues glasner hat mich getreten da habe ich die hand hochgerissen ihn h chstens an der brust oder an der schulter getroffen
2779706 in england w rde er daf r ein jahr lang von den fans ausgepfiffen werden
2779707 klar ist der schiri kann nach einer solchen affekthandlung rot zeigen
2779708 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2779709 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
2779710 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
2779711 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
2779712 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2779713 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2779714 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2779715 one of the best things about completing a dungeon is getting a nice set of armor that offers visual proof of your prowess while dungeons arent the only way to get armor sets in war you can also earn them through realm versus realm combat invading your enemys land and capturing the king and assorted public quests all of the dungeons in the game on launch day will have their own special sets get ready to start crawling collectors
2779716 some cats are in that middle ground some cats just need a second chance
2779717 one woman i know had a cat that meowed constantly at the door he was a very nice cat but he preferred to be outdoors so he was a good candidate for this program
2779718 these kinds of cats are happier in the barn environment
2779719 they might have been tolerant of people eventually but they would have never been socialized
2779720 wed get too attached to them give them milk while we milked the goats and we could hardly get through the winter with them in the barn by spring wed have them in the house
2779721 we have so many mice they sometimes will walk right up to you they dont care
2779722 we needed to get real feral cats that were already streetwise
2779723 we have tons of mice so they should be fat cats by winter
2779724 its not that the surgeon is not involved with the surgery
2779725 its a tool theyre using to enhance their surgical skills
2779726 2006 and 2007 saw big increases in foreclosure filings of 30 and 40 percent so a 20 percent increase is a hopeful sign
2779727 were not expecting an actual drop in total foreclosures but we do hope to see the rate of increase flatten out
2779728 all real estate is local dont believe the negative stories in the media the housing markets fine where you are
2779729 the positive thing i read is we do still have people looking to expand
2779730 the other thing i read is that in a flat economy people are going to be more conservative about their growth
2779731 its uncertainty maybe people arent sure whats going to happen
2779732 the majority of companies just have longmont facilities they dont have facilities all over the world
2779733 the majority of our companies are 50 employees or less
2779734 obviously thats not good because new products are what keep companies growing
2779735 its a very technical skill set theyre having trouble finding
2779736 in past surveys entry level was part of the weakness because they werent able to find that type of worker but our unemployment rate is going up so thats not a problem theyre having
2779737 the political leaderships attitude toward business as a concern for future operations
2779738 they havent taken a single action that would have an adverse effect on primary employers
2779739 but there is a concern yes and i think it stems from a perception a minority perception
2779740 people want to feel that leadership at some level has an affinity for where you are as a business
2779741 we decided to leverage our expertise which is manufacturing in the renewable energy market
2779742 we feel theres a great demographic out there that will pay an extra quarter for products they use every day consumables if they know their money is going to support renewable energy
2779743 were going to co brand our products with whoevers in here
2779744 thats why were being selective as to who we bring in
2779745 hopefully the whole building and everything manufactured in here will go out with our co brand on it
2779746 at nine months we should be installing the equipment to run this facility off biodiesel to check to see if theres a viable market to see if its something people will support
2779747 the municipalities would build the building and the infrastructure through their economic development programs
2779748 my bakery first started in longmont so its kind of full circle
2779749 i went over to community food share and said id love to do something
2779750 i have an ever stronger appreciation for the levels of diversity of economic opportunity in our community
2779751 a lot of people work hard at two or three jobs and they still cant cover food rent and insurance although our economic engine needs them they cant make ends meet
2779752 our community has a lot of needs despite its affluence
2779753 i dont think it would be appropriate for me to talk about it that would breach the very reason for the executive session
2779754 that wasnt the right thing to do just pencil something in when youre signing it
2779755 i think its the job of council to evaluate the info they give us and make our own decisions
2779756 recently there have been a number of issues when weve differed with staff recommendations
2779757 almost every one of us has competed since were young and we dont want to give it up
2779758 we had one gal who competed when she was in her 80s in barrel racing its amazing the drive you have to keep doing it
2779759 ill tell you he can do it faster than i can tell you about it
2779760 we had one guy from oregon hes gone now who rode bulls in his 70s
2779761 but thats scary he didnt know when to give up
2779762 between the kids in 4 h and us being involved in this rodeo its been 24 years
2779763 our little grandson wants to rope all the time and go with his poppa with the steers
2779764 some of these riders probably started in little britches together when they were kids and if someones horse gets hurt or goes down one of these guys will get off and give their competitor their horse
2779765 this is the holiday in which we give our thanks for the bounty of the united states
2779766 and we give that thanks mainly by eating the bounty of the united states
2779767 now im hosting a japanese girl and im friends with some of the mexicans because i speak the language
2779768 id originally planned on trying for the japanese trip but after the interview i realized i was far more qualified for the mexican one
2779769 id been studying their language longer i know nothing about japanese which would have been a disaster
2779770 the idea of sister cities is insanely crucial at this time period
2779771 i want to go on one of those bicycle trails up here
2779772 i keep thinking its a dream or something i dont know its probably the most disappointing thing thats ever happened to me
2779773 we dont have a lot of guys no question about that
2779774 i just feel bad for him that guy popping his achilles that guy comes every single day but whoever said life is fair its sad because hes really done a nice job working to get back ready to go
2779775 in the best case scenario he could appeal and get both years back
2779776 i wouldnt say it couldnt change but for now well go with nate on the left and ryan on the right
2779777 we suspected something unusual was there actually long before they discovered it
2779778 we just knew that there was something different about that that we were anxious to discover
2779779 it was our hope that there was something interesting that we could salvage up there
2779780 it was just black and we couldnt really even tell what it was
2779781 it makes you think about the artist who put it together
2779782 they called them facelifts and they really didnt know what they wanted except they wanted a change
2779783 it was delightful to find that this was in such good shape and once it was cleaned up it really was unique to the downtown
2779784 we havent seen anything like that in the old buildings that weve worked on and weve done a lot of downtown remodels
2779785 we would have rather earned it on the field but we definitely feel were worthy of representing the state as a team weve felt that way all season
2779786 weve been having a hard time accepting that our season ended in the way that it did but we now get another opportunity we get that second chance
2779787 we havent had a lot of guys to choose from a lot of guys are just gassed when they have to go out there and do it weve been trying to be solid and not give up big plays we were better at that last year but we werent very good at creating big plays last year
2779788 the more pressure we can put on the kicks the better our return game is going to be
2779789 id say this over the last couple of years weve had plenty of chances to get there schematically we just have not been very good at getting there
2779790 they wanted to recruit people with a hard work ethic
2779791 weve been missing that one step each year here since coach hawk has gotten here
2779792 weve been getting better and better i think as time goes on were more and more comfortable with our roles and know exactly what to do
2779793 special teams this year is something were going to pride ourselves on
2779794 weve seen too many plays where one block would have broke a punt return or one step this way would have blocked a kick
2779795 it seems like the majority of it came from the vehicle itself
2779796 its been classified as a smaller spill as far as hazmat goes
2779797 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2779798 theres a reluctance to go forward with pieces of it until you know you have concurrence on what the whole thing should look like
2779799 thats exactly why were talking about phasing because its the prudent thing to do in this market
2779800 it probably is frustrating for panattoni it probably does stall or put on hold some of the things they want to do
2779801 but its important for us to have an agreement on the ultimate design of the project
2779802 im looking for my opportunity to give the chronology and reality of where we are today
2779803 im assuming the council members are going to use the opportunity to voice their opinions as well
2779804 we dont have the ability to compel somebody to build
2779805 our hope is that theyre going to conclude that a sams club is warranted in a short period of time but it doesnt appear that their first phase includes that
2779806 everythings kind of linked to the colo 119 and county line road improvements
2779807 were definitely planning on it being a combination site but the timing for the sams club has not been determined
2779808 da sollten wir uns keine illusionen machen journalistisch gestaltete inhalte allein sind sehr schwer zu refinanzieren
2779809 commerce inhalt und monetarisierung zusammenbringen wir b ndeln so zielgruppen verkn pfen print online auftritt und e commerce wer dann auf die homepage von elle klickt kann vielleicht eine designertasche kaufen oder bei meine familie amp ich tischdekoration und k chenger te bis hin zur bratpfanne
2779810 she asked victoria to come on board and help victoria was thrilled
2779811 but when she talked it through with her husband david he thought she was spreading herself a bit thin and should concentrate on what she was good at running a successful fashion line and looking after the family
2779812 when purchasing main system memory ram be sure that you purchase it in pairs
2779813 what would you do if you received 50 messages or more per week from different senders offering products or services you do not want
2779814 well theyre probably just confused as to why a two year old is out so late
2779815 uh she doesnt have a diaper on how is that possible
2779816 wealthy jewish supporters of zionism like robert maxwell and conrad black and rupert murdoch

2779821 so in the end it all depends on whether youll find
2779822 i know that dreams we hold on to can just fade away and i know that words can be wasted with so much to say mmm direi che pu andare in fondo ero tutto meno che spaventata al liceo forse ero anche troppo sicura ma va bene cos if you turned away they will all fall
2779823 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make

2779825 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2779826 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2779827 adultery is generally a leading indicator of faithlessness to the nation throughout the 20th century small betrayals in marriage generally led to larger betrayals and leaders who broke a large vow to one person found it easy to break relatively small vows to millions
2779828 like most small towns theres a lot of fussing and fighting but we call a truce in the summer to make these races happen
2779829 this is an extremely difficult time for all of us that knew and loved ryan and i would ask that we are given the time and space to grieve in private
2779830 i would urge anyone that knows or saw anything to come forward and assist officers from operation trident in their ongoing efforts to trace witnesses to this cold blooded and reckless act
2779831 du hattest es so eilig dass ich nicht mal zeit hatte mir die str mpfe auszuziehen

2779837 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
2779838 edwards was the weaker half of a vital political team
2779839 his wife elizabeth was always the more progressive member of the family writing notes to cindy sheehan more clearly expressing her opposition to the iraq war staking out stronger positions on hot button issues such as same sex marriage
2779840 after she was diagnosed with cancer elizabeth edwards emerged as a a progressive powerhouse especially on health care issues
2779841 it is no loss at this point that john edwards will miss this months democratic national convention
2779842 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
2779843 we need to get rid of caucuses said melissa whitener a waitress from conneaut pa who traveled to lobby the democratic national committee as it prepared its party platform
2779844 specifically laws should be adapted to the people for whom they are framed to the nature and principle of each government to the climate of each country to the quality of its soil to its situation and extent to the principal occupation of the natives whether husbandmen huntsmen or shepherds they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear to the religion of the inhabitants to their inclinations riches numbers commerce manners and customs in fine they have relations to each other as also to their origin to the intent of the legislator and to the order of things on which they are established in all of which different lights they ought to be considered when we consider legal and social systems in relation to these various factors montesquieu believes we will find that many laws and institutions that had seemed puzzling or even perverse are in fact quite comprehensible
2779845 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
2779846 if you have a green party i want to join
2779847 its good for the public to know how little we know
2779848 the woman in the photos is one of the wives of his band members
2779849 to take a break from the tour it was a reward for them to get away and his way of saying thanks for all their hard work
2779850 its not easy to explain a game like grand theft auto iv to an audience thats not native to this art form
2779851 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2779852 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2779853 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2779854 a lot of non black people will say that the election of barack obama is now proof we dont need affirmative action
2779855 in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
2779856 i have no way of knowing whether i was a beneficiary of affirmative action either in my admission to harvard or my initial election to the review if i was then i certainly am not ashamed of the fact for i would argue that affirmative action is important precisely because those who benefit typically rise to the challenge when given an opportunity
2779857 dreams from my father a story of race and inheritance
2779858 there is not a black america and a and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
2779859 an emphasis on universal as opposed to race specific programs isnt just good policy its also good politics
2779860 position on affirmative action programs is important in determining how they will vote
2779861 obama is missing an enormous opportunity because a lot of those who are skeptical of him could close escrow on him if he could give some very visible explanation of his non raciality
2779862 i am disappointed that flipped and changed his position i think in the past he had been opposed to these kinds of ward connerly referenda or initiatives as divisive and i think hes right
2779863 there is precious little evidence that these ballot initiatives drive up turnout in the presidential election
2779864 i dont think he is missing an opportunity on affirmative action
2779865 when the color of ones skin puts one in a position of being treated unequally
2779866 it racializes the campaign in a sense that obama has been trying to avoid
2779867 needs a very large black turnout in several key states and if he takes a position that suppresses the enthusiasm of potential voters who are supporters of affirmative action then hed be in trouble
2779868 could use it if he wanted to have his own
2779869 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2779870 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2779871 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2779872 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2779873 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2779874 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2779875 we are proud that moody s has upgraded the city and county of san francisco s bond rating
2779876 this rating is a statement about the strong fiscal health of san francisco but we must remain steadfast in our commitment to financial prudence and sound managerial practices in order to continue our terrific progress
2779877 among san franciscos strengths were an above average resident socioeconomic profile a highly diverse and robust revenue base an exceptionally strong balance sheet at close of fiscal year 2006 2007 and a moderate debt burden with relatively rapid direct debt retirement
2779878 educators will now benefit from important training on how to make better use of data in the classroom
2779879 as i said in my state of education address effective schools use data to improve student achievement
2779880 this law which was recommended by my p 16 council will go a long way toward helping to close the achievement gap by enabling teachers and their districts to utilize student data in a meaningful way
2779881 i would also like to thank assembly member solorio for carrying this important legislation
2779882 because of his tireless work and leadership throughout the legislative process educators will benefit from important training on how to make better use of data in the classroom
2779883 pfizers decision to locate their biotherapeutics and bioinnovation center in mission bay is a significant win for san francisco and is a clear indication that mission bay is one of the nation s premier life science centers
2779884 san francisco offers companies like pfizer a world class urban innovation district anchored by the nation s pre eminent biomedical university and unparalleled opportunities for collaboration and access to the very best talent that the united states and the world have to offer
2779885 this move to be next door to u c s f s mission bay campus will position pfizers biotherapeutics and bioinnovation center for success in the aggressive pursuit of the most exciting and innovative science and the recruitment of the very best scientists
2779886 mission bay presents a unique opportunity for our entrepreneurial organization to collaborate with world class biomedical scientists and biotech organizations in a campus type setting which allows researchers to easily mingle exchange ideas and collaborate
2779887 by visiting the local communities we can both provide assistance and at the same time hear the concerns of constituents from across california s largest senate district
2779888 dealing with the complexities of state government can be a difficult experience my mobile office hours provide an opportunity for local residents to talk to experienced staff from my office in person
2779889 this is probably the most people weve ever seen use emergency food assistance
2779890 we re seeing people who were making 70 000 a year coming into a food bank for the first time theyve used their retirement to pay their mortgage and gone through their savings
2779891 it is morally repulsive and intellectually absurd that people die of want in a world of surplus
2779892 i led the charge last february to vote against the 10 cuts in provider rates predicting it would have a negative impact on the program itself and on the providers that service medi cal beneficiaries
2779893 now a month into the cuts my prediction was correct and we are now witnessing the fallout as pharmacies are turning away patients in need and clinics are closing their doors
2779894 we cannot expect health care providers to provide services at a loss yet thats exactly whats happening
2779895 in response those providers are making tough decisions that include not accepting new medi cal beneficiaries and cutting hours
2779896 we are simply asking today that lawmakers put the healthcare needs of children and families ahead of
2779897 as an oral surgeon i am acutely sensitive to the health care needs of our citizens i will continue to oppose efforts to balance the california state budget by jeopardizing health care of those in need
2779898 president musharraf is a man of character and no one can point a finger at him he has a clean track record
2779899 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start
2779900 the numbers are there that is written on the wall it is better that he should say goodbye and leave
2779901 i kissed a girl and i liked it i hope my boyfriend dont mind it
2779902 sounds like the type who makes out with her best friend just to get a dudes attention
2779903 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2779904 i really think it is a vindication for the system
2779905 this case is not a vindication of the military commission system
2779906 nach der pflegezeit wird zwar nachgefragt aber nur zur information
2779907 das interesse schwindet in dem moment in dem die menschen erfahren dass es sich um eine unbezahlte zeit handelt
2779908 man will im betrieb nicht als problemfall dastehen und versucht die pflege irgendwie privat hinzukriegen
2779909 wir haben relativ viele mitarbeiter die den familienservice wegen der kinder nutzen aber wir haben wenig nachfrage bei pflegef llen
2779910 bei dem thema ist man diskret und regelt das lieber privat
2779911 pflege ist bisher kaum ein thema ich vermute das f ngt erst an wenn die belegschaft im durchschnitt lter wird
2779912 es gibt anfragen von gro eltern die zur betreuung ihrer enkelkinder am arbeitsplatz eine auszeit nehmen wollen um der tochter einen guten einstieg ins berufsleben zu erm glichen
2779913 das ist f r meine jungs das spiel ihres lebens
2779914 watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2779915 code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background
2779916 this is beach volleyball you have to play the elements sometimes its howling wind sometimes its rain
2779917 we didnt really care we were just so excited to be here and the people who stayed in the crowd were super loud
2779918 linda and i try to have fun with them at send off as they just left their loved ones and need some cheering up
2779919 we listen to their problems as some go back with heavy hearts
2779920 this is because the troops have a tendency to call us grandma and i love each and every one of them like my very own grandchildren
2779921 you can see it on the faces of the soldiers as they go in and out of the airport either going on leave or to return to their battle space
2779922 linda and i are the geriatric cheerleaders greeting them with pom poms
2779923 we joined the uso and this enables us to be with them on the secure side prior to their leaving
2779924 we are assigned to load our carts with goodies such as food stuffs water toiletries books pillows cell phones and we get a chance to really visit and take our pictures
2779925 i have been in touch with them for over three years and they always meet me at the airport
2779926 whether you are for the war or against the war democrat or republican whatever it doesnt make any difference as these young men are there sacrificing their lives for us they are giving up more than people realize
2779927 one doesnt have to support the war to support our troops they are doing their job and we need to show our support to them and thank them every day of our lives for what they do for us
2779928 i will do it until the last one comes home or i am no longer physically able to
2779929 i will support these troops and keep thanking them forever for their service and sacrifice i am very proud of them and appreciate what they do and there has not been a time when i thought about giving up on them
2779930 so many of my adopted grandkids tell me they feel like movie stars or very special because of the wonderful treatment they have gotten here it is almost unbelievable to them that a total stranger could come up to them and give them a hug and tell them that they are loved
2779931 i just love being around the troops i love to talk and joke with them and laugh laughter is good medicine and i like to send them off with a smile on their faces
2779932 i have had so many memorable experiences and i look through my pictures periodically and go down memory lane just being with them is a memorable experience
2779933 i wish that i could have touched more troops as i know that there are plenty out there that dont have family support and i want them to know that they are loved and appreciated
2779934 i want to thank carman and tinnerman for their love and dedication in supporting us they touch the heart of many men and women who flow in and out of dallas international airport i know i was one of them
2779935 i will never forget how much we owe our troops so many lives lost so many lives interrupted never to be the same again
2779936 i do love them with all my heart i will continue to support them in all their efforts wherever they are and i am proud of their dedication and commitment
2779937 i hope you will soon be home in the arms of your loved ones and i am sending you a great big bunch of hugs
2779938 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2779939 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2779940 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2779941 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2779942 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2779943 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2779944 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2779945 i would completely dissuade anyone from visiting arab iraq which is basically two thirds of the country
2779946 but you never hear about the one third that is safe
2779947 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2779948 its an icon of 20th century aviation and it was a piece of the puzzle
2779949 we had to respect it we didnt want the new terminal to have a looming presence
2779950 even a mule wont bump his head again in the same place
2779951 decided to continue carrying it since it does pay its own way
2779952 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2779953 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2779954 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2779955 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2779956 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2779957 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2779958 the notion that compared with their large and mid cap counterparts small cap active equity managers are more likely to outperform their market segment
2779959 under normal circumstances i would have beaten my kazakh opponent and i also had a look at the fight against nakamura i couldnt see anything that would give her a point
2779960 we ranked in the top seven of our peers among days rated cash on hand
2779961 with the price of gas it doesnt make sense for us to go down the streets and theres nothing down there what were supposed to do we want to be fiscally responsible with the taxpayers dollars
2779962 and if theyre paying a fee based on the amount of garbage theyre generating and then they dont pay a fee for recycling then they would be really really encouraged to recycle because then that service would be free and they would be paying for the garbage that they threw away
2779963 during the tree waste months we will take what is called
2779964 residents are limited to eight cubic yards which is basically two pick up trucks full per monthly collection so we dont want a whole house out there to pick up
2779965 over 750 000 british tourists passed through the airport last year on their way to the main resorts but very few stayed in the area and even fewer know about akkaya
2779966 although dalaman town itself isnt particularly picturesque it offers a slice of authentic turkish life and the surrounding countryside is extremely beautiful and there is a lot to do
2779967 ozdere is a secret the turks have been keeping to themselves the resort has fantastic beaches but is very laid back and the people are incredibly friendly
2779968 without the attention of foreign buyers prices in ozdere are lower than nearby resorts like altinkum and kusadasi it is possible to buy a really well built apartment within 5 minutes walk of the beach for gbp 36 500
2779969 ozdere is an excellent investment opportunity with good potential for capital growth the local rental market is buoyant with good quality apartments in demand for long lets by turkish families during the summer
2779970 half of all web sites are infested with some form of malware according to recent studies including many of the leading search social networking and shopping sites
2779971 a majority of all new malware is released on the same day as the corresponding browser vulnerability is announced illustrating that patching alone is not enough
2779972 ich habe mit meiner mutter und meinem bruder telefoniert nat rlich habe ich angst um sie aber meine familie will auch nicht berreagieren
