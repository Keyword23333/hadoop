4510014 the nation needs scientists and engineers put aside defence for the good of the economy and what we want to do is excite young people to know that science and engineering is a great thing to engage in

4510056 do you have dull wintry skin how about blackheads and clogged pores then youll love i hope the aspirin mask its made from aspirin dissolved in water or witch hazel speeds up the process aspirin contains salicylic acid aka beta hydroxy acid an exfoliant that helps slough off dead skin cells and unplug pores its also used to treat acne and hyperpigmentation when skin looks dull and pores are clogged its time to use the aspirin as a mask or scrub

4510063 we are a party of local control and the senate district 16 republicans have endorsed mark olson and we respect that decision

4510065 how can republicans fault dfl senate candidate al franken for writing jokes they deem antifemale when they have put their official arms around a candidate convicted of assaulting his wife
4510066 while we respect our endorsing process in the republican party some things rise far above process and party in terms of importance
4510067 we see in alison krueger an outstanding alternative candidate who like senator wergin combines excellent conservative credentials with a high degree of personal integrity and character accordingly the senate republican caucus will be throwing its full support behind alison krueger and encouraging republicans in sd 16 to vote for her in the september 9th primary
4510068 i stand firmly with the members of the senate republican caucus who today announced that they will not support mark olson for the open senate seat of betsy wergin
4510069 his endorsement by the party is a matter that is of great concern to me w e must maintain and uphold our beliefs that violence of any kind whether it is in word or in deed should not be rewarded with our partys support of the support of voters in senate district 16

4510228 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4510229 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4510230 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal

4510232 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
4510233 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
4510234 one thing wed like to do next is to treat an animal model which already has considerable quantities of alpha synuclein aggregates to see if hsp104 can actually reverse the process in the rat brain

4510254 i know it seems its a pet peeve of yours that italians are gt equated with lousy soldiers running at the first sight of a tommy but i gt think most of us in here know differently
4510255 mostly because the backbone of the italian army were the alpine troops the absolute elite along with the navy incursors among the italian soldiers
4510256 it is ironic because for a large number of patients with ards it is the treatment rather the syndrome which ends up killing them
4510257 now we apply tidal volumes normalized per ideal body weight of six to eight ml kg down from 12 to 15
4510258 the consequences are of course potentially more dangerous in patients in which the chest wall elastance is more compromised and the lung volume is more reduced
4510259 the immediate clinical implications are that clinicians should not trust the conventional measurements

4510261 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time as dissolved oxygen

4510264 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields into the bay
4510265 scientists and farmers need to continue working together to develop farming methods that minimize the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4510266 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4510267 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4510268 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4510269 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4510270 one of the major problems we have in clinical trials for new melanoma therapies is that we cant identify the people who are going to have a slower disease progression no matter what they receive in a clinical trial
4510271 when new treatments are tested it is necessary to show clinical benefit by comparing patients who receive the new therapy with those who do not although patients might all have the same type of cancers there can be big differences in their survival simply because their cancers behave differently and this may have nothing to do with the treatment if we are able to identify the good players and the bad players up front it becomes a whole lot easier figuring out whether good results are due to the new treatment or not most importantly far fewer patients would be needed for the clinical trials its partly because we cant clinically identify subtypes of patients that we have to do very large and very expensive trials and of course this increases the time it takes to test the clinical benefit of potential new therapies
4510272 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4510273 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4510274 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4510275 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4510276 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4510277 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4510278 the identification of rheb as a gene involved in the pathogenesis of cancer opens new avenues for the development of anti cancer therapies as rheb is an inherently druggable target indeed we are already testing such drugs alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutics in faithful animal models
4510279 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4510280 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4510281 the rate of decline in fev1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4510282 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4510283 although treatment did not abolish the accelerated decline in lung function that occurs with copd it did ameliorate it substantially
4510284 the mechanism responsible for the effect on rate of decline is not clear as all treatments have potentially significant nonbronchodilator effects

4510312 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4510313 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4510314 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4510315 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4510316 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4510317 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4510318 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4510319 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4510320 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4510321 in this difficult consumer environment we have continued to focus on tightly controlling all aspects of our business and our second quarter results show the benefits of our approach

4510391 ini adalah musibah yang diberikan oleh tuhan dan kita tidak pernah tahu kapan musibah itu diberikan sabarlah

4510393 ya ya ya tabah bu ya berdoalah dan minta tolong sama yang di atas semoga tidak terjadi apa apa dengan anak kita
4510394 kita harus cari dimana pak banyak banget mayat mayat yang bergelimpangan belum lagi yang tertimbun oleh tumpukan tumpukan kayu sampah batu dan lain lain
4510395 kita harus cari kemana rumah yang di lamjamee telah tinggal pondasinya saja adekku juga telah meninggal tidak ada yang melihat keberadaan ahmad pagi minggu itu
4510396 dikabarkan baru saja ditemukan jasad seorang anak di kawasan bitai kecamatan jaya baru yang anehnya jasad dan bajunya sama sekali tidak hancur tidak berbau dan dia memegang sebuah mangga yang masih utuh kepada keluarga korban aga bisa mengambil mayatnya di bundaran lambaro aceh besar

4510419 it seems to me that we get scandal after scandal in various areas and yet we keep on getting told that we dont need an anti corruption commission in victoria
4510420 eventually they the government will have to come around to it its not a case of if in victoria but when
4510421 we have had allegations of corruption in the police force we have had allegations of corruption in local government and now we have damning allegations of corruption in the racing industry
4510422 the only people standing in the way of proper investigation in victorian are john brumby and rob hulls
4510423 the fact is they are honest hard working loyal and brave men and women who put their life on the line every day they go to work

4510426 the chance is that the virus is still in the horses body and it will come down with the disease at a later time excrete the virus and people will get sick
4510427 its difficult for horses to catch it from the flying foxes and for horses to pass it on to other horses or to people
4510428 technically there was a breach of the law but we understand he was in a difficult situation so were not looking to prosecute him
4510429 we can make inquiries about negligence allegations but weve got no power to order compensation

4510433 the time is ripe for the iraqi nation and government to take control of their own security
4510434 establishment of security in iraq is prerequisite to economic development and social welfare of iraqi people
4510435 the us unfortunately does whatever it wants in iraq we have to restrict them first and then push them out of iraq
4510436 the aim of the presence of us forces in iraq is to serve the security and stability of iraq not to use iraq as a base to target the interests of our neighbors
4510437 it is in our interest to consult with our neighbors iran and other states so as not to be misunderstood
4510438 the issue of a security pact between iraq and the us irritates the sensitivities of everybody the leaders and the states that are friends of iraq
4510439 the interference in determining the destiny of iraq will be harmful especially for the americans themselves they must not demand from iraq more than is required let the iraqi people choose how to live and what government they want

4510511 india is burning and the upa government is sleeping smugly
4510512 there is virtually a siege within and india is being apart with communal and class conflicts and the centre was busy dishing out figures on its achievements
4510513 every nook and corner of the country is in flames the centre has failed to address itself to a solution to even one of the communally troubled spots with jammu and kashmir standing out as a crying testimony to the failure of the upa government to operationalise political processes to resolve the tangle which was the creation of its own opportunistic approach in the first place
4510514 i believe geopolitics and the absence of moving factors are giving rise to a spate of speculation that destabilizes markets and forces many investors to stay on the sidelines pending fresh developments

4510516 the index has now accumulated losses of 900 points or 10 per cent of its total value since july 25 despite the attractive financial ratios of listed firms
4510517 the ongoing dispute between iran and the west over tehrans nuclear programme and the retreat in regional stock markets may have pushed investors to stay on the sidelines instead of taking advantage of falling prices

4510532 calm your mind to cease its infinite desires and it will allow you to properly perceive the ultimate reality of the universe
4510533 monitor the process of your mind be conscious of each thought but do not attach yourself to these thoughts
4510534 allow a thought to come and flow quietly away like a leaf floating by on a glistening stream of your consciousness
4510535 your thoughts are not who you are they are simply thoughts when we attach our identity to the mind and ego we get lost in the chaos they contain

4510547 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy

4510595 battered women tend to stay in abusive relationships for a number of reasons
4510596 battered woman syndrome describes a pattern of psychological and behavioral symptoms found in women living in battering relationships
4510597 battered womans syndrome is best understood as a subgroup of what the american psychological association defines as post traumatic stress disorder rather than as a form of mental illness
4510598 youve come a long way baby the battered womans syndrome revisited
4510599 the court did not reject defendants defense based on the battered spouse syndrome but ruled that the evidence offered through the counselors testimony was too remote in relationship to the shooting to be probative of the defense
4510600 numerous psychiatrists psychologists and social workers now consider the battered spouse syndrome an accepted basis for identification counseling and treatment if a witness qualifies as an expert and a sufficient foundation is laid evidence of the battered spouse syndrome should be admissible
4510601 but it is not a mental disease in the context of insanity
4510602 evidence of bws not only explains how a battered woman might think react or behave it also places the behavior in an understandable light
4510603 a breaking down of a womans self confidence and self respect to a point where she no longer knows if she is crazy or not
4510604 it is clear that the trial court considered battered womans syndrome as a factor in its custody determination in addition to other corroborating evidence to determine whether defendant was a battered woman the court allowed the expert to testify as to battered womans syndrome and the effects of battering upon the victim and any children involved and to give his opinion that the defendant manifested battered womans syndrome
4510605 task for judges is to determine which parent is most likely to provide the child with a healthy caring nonviolent home
4510606 u nlike her abusive partner most abused women do not repeat the abuse experience in a second relationship
4510607 while experiencing the abuse the womans emotional state is sometimes marked by depression somatic concerns anxiety and passivity these symptoms however are most often linked to the relationship and lessen once she removes herself from the abuse an abused woman also has to overcome feeling inadequate crazy or stupid something akin to brainwashing as a result of having been repeatedly told she was these things while in the relationship
4510608 research has shown that spouse abuse typically does not stem from a relationship problem but arises instead from the mans emotional insecurities low self esteem and from a history of abusive behavior seen in his childhood
4510609 does this statutory provision relegate a wanton and brutal beating by the father of a childs mother to be an act of no significance when determining which parent shall be granted custody we believe not for the illinois act further provides that the court shall determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child
4510610 overall the battlefield care is much better than even in desert storm one its really not what the doctors are doing its soldiers taking care of themselves soldiers taking care of each other the best trained medics weve ever had the most courageous medics weve ever had
4510611 we train them to do very quickly what emts and even paramedics do in the civilian sector they learn fast theyre 18 year old kids and they know theyre going to be using those skills and theyre paying attention because they know that they themselves could be one of the patients dont underestimate what an 18 year old kid who decided to defer college to serve his or her country can learn they can learn a hell of a lot
4510612 getting definitive care on the battlefield at the point of injury i think attests to most of the lifesaving on the battlefield if you stop a bleed soon keep a wound clean at the point of injury its saving hundreds of lives
4510613 a lot of solutions to medical problems arent medical theyre engineering solutions theyre it solutions theyre culturation persuading people not to plant that bomb stuff like that the burn thing is one of them

4510642 only a matter of weeks ago critics were calling for woody allen to step away from the camera and retire gracefully before his run of turkeys recently culminating in the lamentable
4510643 ive said before that a new film from woody allen is something like getting a christmas gift from your eccentric aunt you never know if youll get a crocheted toilet paper cozy or a piece of priceless heirloom jewelry
4510644 like shipwrecked sailors awaiting the return of the hero sent for help comedy deprived moviegoers are desperate for the return of the old woody allen the one who made them laugh
4510645 there are long stretches in it where you dont feel allen is repeating himself a rare feeling among his latter day work
4510646 its been easy to forget that allen was once a keen and perceptive chronicler of the human heart and its mysterious fickle desires

4510659 australia has full employment and that is very good for business because people are earning money and spending it
4510660 if you have an inefficient business dont worry just borrow more
4510661 the endless availability of credit has been the wallpaper that has covered the cracks in many inefficient and badly run businesses
4510662 as long as you had some real estate and as long as those asset prices went up more credit was available
4510663 we have had 12 good years about every eight to 10 years you are supposed to get a weeding out
4510664 thats what is happening now and it is being driven by the attitude of the banks after tricom and opes prime
4510665 that caused the banks to go through and reassess every one of the major clients all of the banks are going through that process

4510687 alleged misrepresentations made by wachovia to thousands of its customers about the liquidity risk
4510688 we continue to work with state regulators and others to bring real relief to investors who were not given the forthright information they needed in the process of purchasing auction rate securities
4510689 this agreement in principle with wachovia if approved by the commission will permit tens of thousands of wachovia investors to get their money back
4510690 we understand that unprecedented market conditions have created difficulties for our clients particularly those holding auction rate securities
4510691 we are pleased to announce a comprehensive solution for the liquidity needs of clients who purchased auction rate securities at wachovia and to resolve this matter with federal and state regulators
4510692 the five settlements together provide relief to thousands of investors who were left holding nearly 35 billion worth of securities they could not sell after the widespread failure of the auction rate securities market this past february
4510693 at the heart of this investigation is the simple goal of returning billions of dollars back into the hands of investors which in turn injects confidence into the entire market
4510694 the industry is now taking responsibility for correcting a problem they helped create and well continue working to make all investors whole

4510770 ever since its inception silo has been designed to be accessible to anyone and everyone who wants to do 3d modeling
4510771 the features and workflow improvements we added to silo 2 0 required a moderate price increase so this is a way to make sure were still keeping that high quality modeling functionality available to all
4510772 our goal is to make early stage digital assets resemble their final on screen forms as closely as possible
4510773 starting with accurate models makes the production process more efficient and provides a higher quality end result for example youd want to know early on whether a prominent brow will shadow a characters eyes thats why autodesk mudbox 2009 has texture painting tools and on target display features these will help artists build and refine better 3d models
4510774 the introduction of autodesk mudbox 2009 sparks a revolution in computer graphics tools bringing about a paradigm shift in how designers and artists do their work
4510775 time is money an autodesk mudbox session begins with its artist friendly intuitive interface this is sculpting at the speed of thought with the greatest of fidelity in a business where new ideas with impossible deadlines are commonplace mudbox never lets me down
4510776 a growing number of post production facilities are embracing autodesk toxik as a companion to autodesk maya

4510778 were already working with autodesk maya and autodesk flame so toxik was a natural choice for our pipeline it gives us the power of a node based compositor necessary for professional high end post production work along with a look and feel thats completely comfortable
4510779 the toxik softwares tight integration with maya and intuitive color correction tools have improved the way i composite toxik lets me focus on finishing shots faster as i no longer have to worry about data management

4510784 monmouth county directed counsel to investigate the history and accuracy of the fema mapping process in june we have also begun a thorough assessment of the engineering standards and assumptions used by the army corps of engineers when they constructed the existing flood control structures our goal in all of this is to protect the lives and property of our residents with or without flood insurance and by doing so eliminate the need for this added expense
4510785 in this effort we are working closely with assemblywoman amy handlin and senator joe kyrillos county engineer joseph ettore and assistant county counsel gil messina and i will be meeting with dr tavit o najarian of najarian associates a civil engineering and environmental consulting firm based in eatontown to review information about the proposed fema maps we will also be meeting with congressman frank pallone who is offering some support for our efforts
4510786 although what congressman pallone is proposing will help it is primarily a short term measure while we welcome such assistance for our monmouth county residents our long term objective is to prevent flooding from ever occurring with the firm belief that it is better to have no flooding and need no insurance then to have your home flooded with insurance in hand
4510787 we have focused on the equally significant threat posed by street level distributors
4510788 we are resolved to the growing problem of the illegal sale of prescription drugs
4510789 these drugs are so readily available they are literally just laying around peoples houses
4510790 the drug activity in the bayshore does target young people the danger with these prescription drugs is that it generally starts as a precursor to other more significant drug use
4510791 the criminals dont recognize borders other activities go along with the narcotics be it theft or burglaries used to support their habits so its a larger problem than just the narcotics
4510792 its very clear that green energy is now front and center in the minds of the business sector

4510939 this is what you must become you must keep your feet grounded so firmly on the earth that its like you have four legs instead of two that way you can stay in the world but you must stop looking at the world through your head you must look through your heart instead that way you will know god
4510940 while we have recently seen some encouraging data to indicate that homelessness is trending downward it is abundantly clear that we have a long way to go before we can live in a country where everyone has a home
4510941 the only way to continue to make progress against the issue of homelessness is to recognize that it is not a political issue but rather a humanitarian one we are hopeful that this first of its kind forum for discussion will assist in getting the issue of homelessness on the radar of both democrats and republicans as there is much work to be done
4510942 this breakfast is another opportunity for us to highlight some of the important work being done not just in denver but in cities around the country to end homelessness
4510943 we are delighted to be co hosting this event in partnership with our friends in minnesota as we know that homelessness transcends party lines it is an issue that impacts all of us and as we know from our work in denver it is an issue that is solvable if we all work together
4510944 both of these events continue an important dialogue about ending homelessness
4510945 homelessness can affect you whether you are living in denver minneapolis st paul duluth anchorage or tallahassee we look forward to co hosting this event in minneapolis talking about what we are doing here in minnesota and learning more about what is going on across the nation

4510954 you would normally expect the mortgage rate to follow the term deposit rate downwards
4510955 its funny earlier this week we heard that one of the reasons banks could not cut mortgage rates was the high returns being paid to savers
4510956 now we are seeing savings rates falling and the banks still arent cutting rates they are running out of excuses
4510957 its classic profiteering the banks think everybody is keeping a close eye on mortgage rates and has forgotten about savings rates and credit cards
4510958 as for raising their credit card rates now you can make your own mind up about that there is simply no excuse
4510959 we take any changes to interest rates very seriously taking into account the total cost of funds competitive pressures and impact on customers these are the factors behind this particular card interest rate change

4510963 i believe george has severe anger management issues georges anger is constant and persistent
4510964 he is unable to control his anger in front of the children george would criticise and pick fights with pam or the nannies
4510965 george faulted me with the incident and yelled at me that i was useless in front of son georgie
4510966 when i asked george if he was serious in blaming me for such an incident he fired me on the spot and sent me to my room to pack my belongings while he stood over me in an intimidating way
4510967 george then realised that since pam was away and he was incapable of handling the three children on his own that he needed me to stay
4510968 i agreed to stay because i was concerned for the kids and i had promised pam i would take good care of the kids in her absence
4510969 it was a very scary incident pam terminated our trip early because of georges drinking and angry rages

4510998 how the body is modified through interactions facilitated by digital technology
4510999 using technology to break out of the frame of the image and thereby empower the body
4511000 perception can no longer be defined in terms of the relationship between images
4511001 the virtual object are seemingly and paradoxically located within the actual space
4511002 if we want to create performances that are interesting for human audiences it is essential to use human bodies on stage because the emotional impact depends largely on resonance between the bodies on stage and the bodies in the audience
4511003 what happens in vr is that the body disappears because it is turned on itself yet as it disappears from the domain of the visual image the body materializes in the domain of form where it experiences itself as absolute sensation or subjectivity
4511004 rather than acting as the object of digital modulation the image here functions as a catalyst for the breakdown of the visual register itself skulls explores the topological freedom of digital modulation and attempts to give the viewer some interface with this visually impenetrable domain

4511012 podemos echar una mano pero los problemas de estas familias no se solucionan en tres meses y la situaci n va a empeorar porque dicen que la crisis puede prolongarse dos o tres a os las familias en esta situaci n van a tenerlo muy dif cil para aguantar tanto
4511013 in this difficult consumer environment we have continued to focus on tightly controlling all aspects of our business and our second quarter results show the benefits of our approach
4511014 norm coleman is desperately running from his record of rock solid support of george bush including for bushs privatization scheme but the 814 000 minnesotans who depend on social security benefits cant afford to gamble on another bush cheney mccain coleman privatization crusade and they cant afford to gamble on norm coleman
4511015 no one in todays debate on the future of social security advocates changing social security for those who are receiving retirement benefits or for those nearing retirement the retirement security youre counting on is intact and will never change under any plan but we want to give our children and grandchildren a better life than we had unfortunately social security on its current course cannot do that
4511016 letting younger workers invest in personal accounts that draw interest like a 401k plan makes sense as an approach to giving them retirement security equal to if not better than our own
4511017 americans should have a say in how their social security money is invested allowing people to invest part in conservative investments like a 401k is an opportunity to do this people could not touch this money until they retire lump sum withdrawals would be prohibited and other protections would ensure retirement security
4511018 colemans check to larson constitutes an unequivocal admission that coleman accepted a years worth of free utilities from larson in clear violation of rule 35 of the standing rules of the senate
4511019 but while the fact that coleman violated senate rules is clear cut answers to several outstanding questions remain less clear including how did senator coleman and larson arrive at the 532
4511020 senator coleman also failed to disclose the free rent that he received in november 2007 from larson when somehow the two of them forgot that a rent payment was due
4511021 the size of the senators bedroom or how poorly it may be decorated has no bearing on the fact that the highly discounted 600 in rent that senator coleman pays doesnt come close to market value for the location which ample publicly available evidence proves
4511022 the rules of economy arent working for hardworking minnesotans right now though they work extremely well for corporate special interests
4511023 if senator colemans embarrassed by this affair he should be
4511024 take the senator at his word look at what he gave you and other reporters
4511025 coleman and larson have had a rather loose arrangement when it comes to the senators monthly 600 rent payments copies of the checks they provided to national journal showed that the checks were often written nine or more days after the first of the month larson didnt cash a check written on march 10 until june 17 after nj questioned coleman and larson about their arrangement
4511026 this is a legitimate question to be asking in light of the fact that he is apparently renting from someone with an interest in his official actions as a senator
4511027 coleman staff confirmed he has access to entire english basement apartment
4511028 a set of stairs beneath the three story row houses front door leads down to his private entrance to the garden level apartment the main carpeted living room with a low approximately 7 foot ceiling is cluttered with desks computers and telephones used by his landlords employees during business hours
4511029 two couches and a tv fill the far end of the living room leroy coleman said the senator may use the couches occasionally sen coleman doesnt have a kitchen but his wet bar lines the back of the living room it includes a small sink cupboard space and an empty wine cooler the mini fridge was well stocked with bottled water and yogurt on the marble counters were granola bars and other snack food and the senators iron and ironing board
4511030 the indictment returned by a federal grand jury in charges that stevens made false statements on his annual senate financial disclosure statements for the years 2001 through 2006 to conceal gifts from veco corp and its chief executive officer bill allen if hes convicted stevens could face an unspecified fine and as much as five years in prison

4511042 ive been a manager for nearly 20 years and in some respect ive had an easy life
4511043 in the past the vultures have never circled around me and put the pressure on thats the case now then i just have to deal with it
4511044 someone has to be the favourite to be first to go i looked on when i was a 40 1 outsider and wondered what its like
4511045 last year i think martin jol was in a fairly similar position
4511046 theres always someone maybe im doing the other 19 managers a favour at the moment
4511047 whats been said hasnt shaken my self belief because ive been at west ham 18 months stayed up and finished 10th even though we had many problems
4511048 like everyone im hoping for better things from this season i understand the criticism and take it on board
4511049 i dont just close my eyes to it but i dont have to accept all of it either
4511050 it seems a bit pre meditated in some respects but i just have to get on with it
4511051 the criticism is part and parcel of the game now the build up starts on thursday and doesnt die down until tuesday
4511052 everyones clamouring for a piece and all managers understand the pressure of the job
4511053 there wont be too many complaining because we know its part and parcel of what we do thats the way it is in the premier league now
4511054 i always seem to be defending myself and the team so id like not to have to do that i want everyone to give us a fair crack
4511055 theres no manager in the country who wants to be in a challenging position then fall away as if we do it on purpose
4511056 its amazing that people keep talking like that this reference to charlton is irritating because theyre a totally different set of circumstances
4511057 charlton came from nowhere and tried to establish themselves in the premier league they did that successfully
4511058 but west ham are different last season the team picked itself because injury meant there was no one left
4511059 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner mike ashley and myself and i am sure he will not be leaving st james park
4511060 it looks like abdoulaye faye is going to stoke and shola ameobi has been given permission to speak to ipswich but thats the end of players going out
4511061 and what we have to do is to make sure we get better players coming in than those who are going out and this will take some doing because they are quality players who are going out
4511062 as far as our signings have been concerned the quantity is low but the quality is very high
4511063 he showed his experience and with fellow central defender steven taylor being so fresh his experience has been important and i think those two are quite good together
4511064 joey has not had a pre season and he is nowhere near ready to play first team football
4511065 a lot of this happened before i came back to the club and we have given him another chance or even the last chance and the rest is up to him
4511066 but he has kept on the straight and narrow since i have been here
4511067 he wont play on sunday and his next target is our first home game with bolton wanderers next weekend
4511068 its a tough target but one we are hoping he will get to

4511075 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
4511076 lets hope that we are the leicester city of the division they came and beat us 4 1 at home they were a team that struggled all season and the perception is that we are going to be little albion struggling and fighting around the bottom of the league
4511077 yet you can win we were perceived as the top of the table big team but the team who are struggling can win on any given day if they get it right
4511078 that day we had a sending off and who is to say there wont be one on saturday i dont know whats going to happen
4511079 all you can do is prepare thoroughly be ready for the game be mindful of how you hope it is going to go give the players scenarios and send them out
4511080 there is no arguing the fact that cesc fabregas is very important to how they are i do believe the strength of arsenal is their team ethos and i dont think anything changes
4511081 fabregas goes out and whether denilson or someone else comes in the ball still moves from a to b to c and they still shift it around the pitch
4511082 csec gives them that extra bit of direction and quality but they will play exactly the same way
4511083 they still have adebayor and van persie up front walcott coming in off the wing and other great players all over the pitch
4511084 playing arsenal on day one is fine for us its on tv its the first game in the premiership its a big occasion the first game of any season is an occasion
4511085 hopefully the recent wembley appearances will have prepared the players mentally for the occasion because thats what the opening day of any season is regardless of the level
4511086 the wembley appearances of the last two seasons means our players should be prepared for the occasion we will go there and give it our best shot
4511087 arsenal are a team full of world class players we know it will be a tough day when were out of possession
4511088 the opening day of any season is a big game for supporters and players we know itll be 80 odd degrees the grass at arsenal will be beautifully manicured there will be a lot of colour a lot of noise and we have to mentally ready for it
4511089 i scored there and got my goal which was unbelievable i cant describe the feeling but im sure the lads will be wanting to do the same i will certainly be wanting to do it again
4511090 it will be a great day out for us hopefully we wont get overawed and get turned over its a big game to start the season
4511091 you dont get any tougher than arsenal away but we will just take it in our stride and hopefully do a good job there is excitement about getting the league started and getting back to playing again
4511092 we have got to be hard working show concentration and play our own game im sure we will be fine
4511093 we are here now we are premier league players and premier league team we have to be hard on ourselves and push ourselves rewards will come if we do

4511190 as with the residential inspectors this was not the outcome we had hoped for but we must move forward with a professionalized staff
4511191 this is a complete sham to cover up management failures
4511192 it is no secret that dcra is a mess this is endemic to what weve seen in other d c agencies and frankly we are concerned as there is no legal reason why these inspectors should be fired
4511193 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4511194 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance

4511210 we oppose the grp milf peace panel memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain because it is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was any appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed many if not all of its provisions violate the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4511211 we further strongly oppose provisions in the moa ad granting the milf through the bangsamoro juridical entity bje exclusive ownership over the bangsamoro homeland and removing this area from the public domain
4511212 it inputs will be collated first it is premature to make an initiative while there is an oral argument in the supreme court we are studying the possibility but we are careful not to get into what the judiciary is doing

4511232 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4511233 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4511234 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this

4511265 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4511266 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq

4511304 we at johnson amp johnson have been making bath time a safe and soothing experience for far too long
4511305 years of pampering have left our newborns helpless feeble and ill equipped for the arduous road ahead
4511306 its time our children got the wake up call thats been coming to them
4511307 a political settlement plan should be implemented first after that the parties may move to discussing the two republics status
4511308 while earlier russian diplomacy simply used the self proclaimed republics as an instrument to pressure tbilisi now it finally has to make some decisions
4511309 holding the olympic games in sochi accepting russia into the wto russias g8 presence and activities of the russian companies on global markets could all be under question
4511310 it is not serious and is just rhetoric prior to the u s presidential elections the only serious point concerns the wto
4511311 of course if the olympic games were going ahead in sochi next year then a boycott could be in first place but we are talking about 2014 and many presidents will have been replaced by then
4511312 if they want to put russia under pressure they should act in a different way as they say in such cases hug to death
4511313 many experts propose numerous measures to make russia withdraw its troops from georgia assuming moscow officials do not want a new cold war however the situation appears that some do want this
4511314 overall we can do nothing to force russia to leave georgia
4511315 theoretically everything is possible but in practice a world war is unlikely some things have changed compared with the first and second world wars
4511316 first the great powers have developed many common long term interests
4511317 today we are on the brink not of a new world war but of a serious complication in relations between russia and the west
4511318 in general the public whipping of georgia is not only connected with south ossetia although georgia provided more than a valid occasion for russia to launch this action with a clear conscience
4511319 we are of course very fond of the abkhaz and ossetians but one should put a broader perspective on it we do not want military political blocs of which we are not members to move to our borders in the post soviet space
4511320 europe does not want war nor does russia georgia does not count it is a puppet playing its local role georgia might have been a trigger and a casus belli if the world was ready for war but that is not so
4511321 world wars happen when the national interests of states are involved the conflict in ossetia pursues local not world goals the u s and europe are not prepared militarily to become embroiled in this mess the u s of course has its own interest to support its satellite georgia but not by jeopardizing its own national interests

4511325 the tournament director will be marsha huard who is also the director of the riverrock tennis and education association
4511326 people should join this tournament because the money that will be raised at the tournament will go back to the riverrock tennis and education assocation to fund their local programs junior programs and additional activities they host for the community like free carnivals and block parties
4511327 of course there will be trophies given out to the winners of the tournament which will make for a great competition

4511329 wenn sich die nato auf ihrem gipfel in bukarest nicht auf dr ngen von frankreich und deutschland von uns abgewandt h tte w ren die russen jetzt nicht einmarschiert
4511330 damit gaben die europ er den russen gr nes licht uns anzugreifen
4511331 wenn sich die anderen nato staaten 1955 genauso verhalten h tten w re die bundesrepublik wegen der deutschen teilung nie in das b ndnis gekommen und schutzlos geblieben gegen die sowjetische bedrohung
4511332 georgien ist ein schl sselland f r den transit ber unser territorium laufen die einzigen pipelines die gas und l an russland vorbei aus dem kaspischen raum nach westen bringen und moskau will die um jeden preis selbst kontrollieren
4511333 wir haben eine winzige luftwaffe die russen hatten immer die lufthoheit
4511334 sonst h tte russland gar nicht so schnell so gewaltige streitkr fte ber die grenze bringen k nnen
4511335 im kreml fasste man das offenbar als handlungserm chtigung auf
4511336 der westen geht in vielem der propaganda des kreml auf den leim
4511337 russlands einfluss auf die ffentliche meinung in europa ist gewaltig der kreml arbeitet mit den alten instrumenten aus sowjetzeiten und kgb methoden
4511338 wenn das alte europa nicht einschreitet wird es selbst verlieren denn ohne georgien wird es noch abh ngiger von russischem l und gas und der kreml wird es gnadenlos in die zange nehmen und seine bedingungen diktieren
4511339 europa ist als n chstes dran in nicht allzu ferner zukunft wird der kreml es behandeln wie uns
4511340 moskau bricht alle vereinbarungen und zieht seine truppen nicht zur ck denn je mehr fl chtlinge sie produzieren je mehr elend sie anrichten umso gr er wird der druck der opfer auf saakaschwili so das kreml kalk l doch die rechnung wird nicht aufgehen

4511342 the restructuring of the auto industry has impacted auto workers
4511343 most vehicles are still assembled in the united states but carmakers need fewer workers to put them together and they are using more imported parts the international carmakers and most suppliers are non union and they pay lower wages and benefits than the detroit three carmakers
4511344 there has been a general dissatisfaction with the term allied health for quite a while because its very vague
4511345 since there are so many new programs and professions entering the field many educators feel that identifying these schools or colleges as learning institutions for health professions is more recognizable
4511346 factoring in only the public sector costs for maternity care delivery and one year of infant related care for those contraceptive clients who would be eligible for medicaid maternity care in their state if they became pregnant
4511347 at the same time the costs of birth have gone up as well
4511348 federal and state budgets are so tight it is important to demonstrate the savings for people who might be skeptical about the benefits that it is fiscally prudent it is not only a good thing to do it makes economic sense it can really help depoliticize an issue
4511349 we are very enthusiastic about the leadership that kelvin lee brings to dbi
4511350 he is not only one of the top young researchers in the field but gained important experience as director of the new york state center for life science enterprise and the institute for biotechnology and life science technologies at cornell before joining ud last year i look forward to working with him to advance dbi as a key driver of our life science initiatives and as a model for additional interdisciplinary research institutes to be developed as part of the universitys strategic plan
4511351 psychologists need to examine the attitudes and behaviors in the wider context of beliefs about environmental and social change
4511352 this was especially true for respondents who described themselves as democrats and those who said they trusted scientists
4511353 but for republicans and those who had little trust in scientists more knowledge did not mean there was more concern

4511361 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4511362 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4511363 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4511364 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4511372 you would normally expect the mortgage rate to follow the term deposit rate downwards
4511373 its funny earlier this week we heard that one of the reasons banks could not cut mortgage rates was the high returns being paid to savers
4511374 now we are seeing savings rates falling and the banks still arent cutting rates they are running out of excuses
4511375 its classic profiteering the banks think everybody is keeping a close eye on mortgage rates and has forgotten about savings rates and credit cards
4511376 as for raising their credit card rates now you can make your own mind up about that there is simply no excuse
4511377 we take any changes to interest rates very seriously taking into account the total cost of funds competitive pressures and impact on customers these are the factors behind this particular card interest rate change

4511381 we have four children and when we go on vacation they always go with us
4511382 i am an old timer these are the kinds of parents who will think nothing of purchasing a pool hummer 300 leather jacket camper boat cellphone and cable tv but when it comes down to day care they will always seek to find the best deal
4511383 what parents today dont realize is that there is a price to pay for these big ticket items the price is working lots of overtime and away from family time and kid time take your kids or dont go on vacation
4511384 the idea of parents needing to get away from their children once in a while reflects a deep rooted attitude that is the basis for a number of marital problems
4511385 if one or both partners refuse to give up their personal needs so that the relationship can grow there are problems
4511386 what a terrible feeling to think someone especially your parents needs their space from you husbands wives and parents want to continue with all their needs and wants regardless of who it hurts if parents spent more time with their kids instead of running off on their getaways maybe they would be aware of their childrens needs and problems

4511454 whether search terms or keywords will yield the information sought is a complicated question involving the interplay at least of the sciences of computer technology statistics and linguistics
4511455 will go a long way towards convincing the court that the method chosen was reasonable and reliable
4511456 requires the utmost care in selecting a methodology that is appropriate for the task
4511457 careful advance planning by persons qualified to design an effective search methodology
4511458 a continuing series of diagnostic tests used to determine the extent of an injury and the appropriateness of treatment
4511459 there is no reason that such a plaintiff could not also recover medical monitoring costs
4511460 when science and medicine are able to identify harm before it becomes manifest and to do so with sufficient clarity our precedents do not foreclose an action in negligence or the remedy of medical monitoring
4511461 we will undoubtedly be called upon to consider how to address negligence claims from use of dangerous substances that have caused harm that only scientific or medical testing can disclose
4511462 the practical effect of this decision is to make almost every west virginian a potential plaintiff in a medical monitoring cause of action
4511463 a n exposed plaintiff can recover related reasonable medical monitoring costs as an element of damages if and when he develops symptoms

4511590 quite apart from the department of energys gnep activities areva is evaluating establishment of a commercial used fuel recycling center in the u s current projections suggest that construction could begin as early as 2013 with receipt of used fuel in 2017
4511591 project specific proposals for the siting construction and operation of a nuclear fuel recycling center an advanced recycling reactor and an advanced fuel cycle research facility
4511592 the success of gnep will be judged on the quality of research it produces not on the number of national laboratories it supports

4511614 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
4511615 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4511616 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4511617 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
4511618 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

4511628 what will god do discard the humanity project the way a potter throws a mis shapen still wet pot back into the primordial clay from which it sprang or continue to work with it courage is the capacity to move ahead in spite of despair
4511629 the depths of all parental resilience are rooted in a courage that continues to invest in life in spite of surprises difficulties and disappointments all because its love of that life is too great to give up
4511630 relationships are sustained by the courage to reach out again forgive once more seek clarity in the midst of confusion and change expectations more than once

4511635 but at the moment were concentrating on trying to gel the team together
4511636 the attitude and application of the lads has been great
4511637 when you come in the early rounds you have got to win a lot of matches to even dream about that but we have to start somewhere
4511638 there is a real positive air about the place we had a great finish to last season and weve had a strong pre season
4511639 the management has got a good squad together and we are expecting our best ever season in the unibond league we are hoping to challenge for promotion
4511640 we had no idea what we could do really when i saw the time for the first ride on the board i thought i must have read it wrong
4511641 we have known for a long time that he is special when it comes to cycling but we did not expect him to progress quite this quickly
4511642 we are so pleased for him and are hopefully going to get to see him tomorrow when he has a rest day
4511643 we havent spoken to him properly yet he came up the track and gave us a hug after he crossed the finish line and we said well done and congratulations
4511644 he was as you would expect totally chuffed this is what he has been aiming for it is the ultimate achievement for an athelete
4511645 hes young and talented and not fazed by the pressure at all hes perfect for the team

4511647 there was a little bit of luck in the double save the first save went straight back to him i could have saved it it could have gone the other way but it was just like two reaction saves it worked out well
4511648 i wanted to play so of course i was disappointed but anybody would be or otherwise they shouldnt play football
4511649 i tried to redeem myself on tuesday and it went okay we just have to see what happens
4511650 but theres only one of us that can play the gaffer chose to go for diego in the first game which is fair enough but he chose me on tuesday so we just have to take it from there
4511651 it was hard work when i was the only keeper on the books
4511652 its completely different now the club has moved forward massively and has some good players in compared to the first season when i was here when we had to get rid of players
4511653 with the old gaffer and stan ternent he had to get rid of players because we never made a play off position or promotion and we had a big wage bill we had to get rid of players and had a squad of about 15
4511654 then when steve cotterill came mark yates the coach was on the bench and that was a squad of about 15 or 16 players as well
4511655 now weve got 23 or 24 and probably a couple more so were definitely working in the right direction
4511656 im always inspired by competition you need somebody to keep you on your toes because otherwise you only go the other way
4511657 as soon as somebody keeps you on your toes you work harder try to get fitter and try to do everything right and so far so good
4511658 were fighting for one place and its going to be a fair competition there so well just see how it goes and let the gaffer make the decision that he needs to do
4511659 thats the main thing this season because its going to be a toughy this year the teams that have come down and the teams that have come up are actually quite big clubs and theyre all aiming for good positions to get promoted
4511660 last season there wasnt really a team that stood out this season is probably going to be similar but i think theres going to be a lot more teams involved at the top
4511661 its going to be a hard game tomorrow ipswich have always been known for being a good footballing side and an attacking side its going to be a good and interesting game
4511662 now 180 college students and 500 community volunteers are ready to publicise aids related knowledge

4511691 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4511692 each of these fenced in areas is about five yards by five yards
4511693 theres a lock on the door how long those arrested will be kept here is not known a sign on the wall reads
4511694 the poor umpire when he saw the replay later spent the rest of his time apologizing to the florida team and anybody else
4511695 we thought we had the technology available to us all our games are televised
4511696 its just another tool were going to give our umpires
4511697 we put that play into our replay system and found they could have had the play resolved in 30 seconds
4511698 theres nothing quite like seeing these kids from every corner of the globe coming together right here in aberdeen
4511699 its so much bigger than baseball its a true reminder that kids are kids no matter where theyre from witnessing the international camaraderie of the cal ripken world series truly gives you goosebumps
4511700 the level of baseball played at the cal ripken world series is the highest there is for 12 year olds
4511701 you actually see doubles triples stolen bases and pickoffs the skills these kids possess and display are absolutely amazing
4511702 all of a sudden four to five strays may show up on an afternoon overcrowding our facilities and driving my staff into a frenzy of rearrangement thats a big stress factor
4511703 you cant underestimate the responsibility we have to keep our regular patients safe
4511704 many strays come in infested with fleas or ticks no matter how busy we are my staff has to take care of this pronto to safeguard our regular patients
4511705 almost all of the males are unneutered and the smell from one unneutered cat can make the whole clinic smell unclean to our clients
4511706 that means more veterinary and tech time used at our clinic since we ask our more inexperienced staff members not to handle these for their own safety we get a lot of pit bulls in after drug raids folks being carted off to jail or psych wards most of those folks dont spend a lot of time training dogs
4511707 some of these dogs get claimed but some of those owners are downright nasty none of our regular clientele is nasty because we get rid of them
4511708 trying to figure out what to do in those cases when were just jammed with our regular work is frustrating and time consuming
4511709 strays tend to have a higher percentage of large untrained or vicious animals
4511710 we really appreciate the opportunity to have a place to hide
4511711 i am unwilling to put my staff my family and myself through the next spring and summer with an added considerable stress of all the county strays
4511712 one clinic is left to do what they can with all the strays
4511713 that is just a nightmare for us its a problem for the county too as several weeks during the year we have to call and say we have absolutely no room
4511714 i was shocked by the number of people who came in and said they had no idea that there were so many strays i guess im so immersed in this that i had no clue that everybody wouldnt be aware since those articles in the paper adoptions have been up
4511715 i am thoroughly convinced that youve done an outstanding job and i guess that too many times we do take people for granted
4511716 to look into the program that we have now make some recommendations back to the county board for what we should do in the future we basically have got an ultimatum at this point in time and that is to say if we dont do something by march were no longer going to even have a single clinic to go to and i think at this point in time were in dire need to come up with some resolutions to this problem
4511717 over the years dr clifford loomis in his time and dr brodd now have repeatedly told their committee that the situation is bad and getting worse that this is such a tough job so poorly compensated so thoroughly unacknowledged that it would someday fail without big changes
4511718 weve all come to assume that the veterinarians should be more involved than anyone else dont we and yet we make this assumption about no other profession
4511719 we dont expect doctors dentists nurses or chiropractors to take the homeless into their offices and keep them do we
4511720 but the stray animal problem is societys problem not one small professions problem
4511721 the feedback we get for this is usually people telling us how much more we should do you know free surgery clinics free extensive medical treatment of strays ive had people come in with suggested schedules of the afternoon a week i should work at this or that shelter for free all of us in the profession have that attitude is at least as much of a factor as the low pay in veterinarians abandoning the program
4511722 we really need help if it is possible to get a county shelter up and running soon great my problems here would be solved if this is not feasible then compensation for these services needs to be such that the other clinics can be recruited back into the program

4511724 r gimen de musharraf ha sido sustituido por un h brido civil militar que carece de voluntad o capacidad para hacer frente a la amenaza que representa el extremismo y la combatividad la realidad es que el gobierno civil y el establishment militar del pa s parecen que han perdido el control de la situaci n
4511725 every day that a woman takes the birth control pill she is saying no to god and she is sinning
4511726 that is cutting her off from the graces and blessings she would be receiving i dont think people realize the damage its doing to them the health of their marriage and the health of their family as long as people are trusting birth control instead of god were going to have problems
4511727 basically birth control interferes with gods plan as stated in humanae vitae
4511728 you have a two month old on one side of the bed a 16 month old on the other and a two and a half year old in another room
4511729 so you take your chance and spend the next few weeks longer if you are breast feeding worrying yourself sick and wondering if you are pregnant again this is married life

4511732 la questione pi urgente oggi limmediato e ordinato ritiro delle forze armate russe e il loro ritorno in russia
4511733 questa decisione dimostra chiaramente tutto quello che abbiamo detto di recente
4511734 il dispiegamento di nuove forze antimissili ha come suo obiettivo la federazione russa
4511735 bullismo e intimidazioni non sono modi accettabili per condurre la politica estera nel 21esimo secolo
4511736 noi vogliamo assolutamente che il piano in sei punti sia implementato molto rapidamente in modo che i soldati russi non stiano pi in georgia fuori da abkahzia e ossezia del sud

4511738 horner has never been selected to an olympic squad he was left off the u s team in 1996 despite being the top ranked rider in the country in 2000 and 2004 usa cycling used automatic and discretionary criteria in addition to olympic qualifying events won in 2000 by antonio cruz and in 2004 by mccartney
4511739 the decision either comes down to politics brownnosing they just dont like me or they are idiots it must be politics because nobody is that stupid
4511740 at some point each of us is someone elses bad guy

4511744 bisognava che colei che aveva portato in grembo il creatore quando era bambino abitasse con lui nei tabernacoli del cielo
4511745 come insegna il concilio vaticano ii ha continuato benedetto xvi maria santissima va sempre collocata nel mistero di cristo e della chiesa in questa prospettiva la madre di ges come in cielo glorificata ormai nel corpo e nellanima limmagine e la primizia della chiesa che dovr avere il suo compimento nellet futura cos sulla terra brilla quale segno di sicura speranza e di consolazione per il popolo di dio in cammino fino a quando verr il giorno del signore cfr 2 pt 3 10 cost lumen gentium 68 dal paradiso la madonna continua a vegliare sempre specialmente nelle ore difficili della prova sui suoi figli che ges stesso le ha affidato prima di morire in croce

4511774 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4511775 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4511776 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4511777 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4511778 the hybrid system that were developing we can apply to any vehicle that we have
4511779 you can still haul your cargo but you can still be environmentally sound too
4511780 it takes hydrogen and oxygen combines it to form water and at the same time produces electricity
4511781 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
4511782 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
4511783 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
4511784 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
4511785 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
4511786 the important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical more easily sourced outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective
4511787 doping by the pool invalidates phelps beijing 2008 olympic swimming gold world records
4511788 music can have influences on the breathing rate e g via emotional effects such an increased arousal which will alter oxygen levels in the blood or relaxing effects so that fewer muscles consume oxygen which also increases oxygen levels
4511789 has reported clear changes in breathing rate on a conference last year with breathing rate being higher during pleasant music
4511790 duration of the effect is not certain from seconds to minutes
4511791 m usic next to the swimming pool less than 2 minutes before the start could indicate performance enhancement because of transient increase of blood oxygen capacity
4511792 a bio chemical feedback mechanism from an external source the external source in the present case music is available to everyone not harmful to the athlete or his peers and carried out under full disclosure hence i do not see how this conflicts with fair play and honesty
4511793 i am not an expert on the world anti doping agency wada
4511794 the journal aims to become a leader and worldwide forum
4511795 the suits are certainly a factor how much of a factor is a subject of debate speedos lzr racer which was developed in cooperation with nasa and is designed to reduce drag has received considerable attention for its laser bonded seams and its ability to increase oxygen intake by 5 percent
4511796 dr koudinov now gets a few minutes of fame with his idiotic conclusion people that listen to music cheat idiot
4511797 the americans we are going to smash them thats what we came here for
4511798 knowing there are many people coming in and out of the building who are poor
4511799 the industry needs tremendous regulation because people have been hurt
4511800 i tried to explain to her that the spiel was full of lies
4511801 for them to run around and say rates would go down is ridiculous
4511802 i think if theyre going to spend millions of dollars to protect their right to gouge they better be telling the truth
4511803 if anyone has any actual evidence that something was said incorrectly we ask that the circulators name be obtained and we will take swift action to investigate and remove the employee if necessary

4511808 ive spent a few weeks getting the money together but i think i might have to look for somewhere else
4511809 i was worried about traffic chaos and didnt think about the shop
4511810 but when i parked at the coronation pub i saw wed been hit by the fire and it was quite a shock
4511811 the shop was cordoned off but from what i saw it looked gutted
4511812 im a bit shocked but you have to make do and do the best you can
4511813 weve just got a bit of damage to the ceiling where the waters come in
4511814 first there was just smoke billowing out and then the flames came all of a sudden the flames just spread the fire brigade were having a job getting through the door so they went through the window upstairs
4511815 when we turned up we found an extensive fire just about through the roof
4511816 we made the turnout up to four pumps plus the hydraulic platform
4511817 at one stage there were eight pumps a hydraulic platform at the incident
4511818 you could see the fire from quite a distance there was a large amount of smoke
4511819 i was driving down the a19 from hartlepool and at the first norton turnoff you could see a plume of smoke it was clear we had a well developed fire
4511820 when the roof went in it was too dangerous to put firefighters into the two shops beneath the restaurant because of the dangers to firefighters when there was no risk of life we had to force an entry at first floor level but we managed to get a good stop on the fire and prevented it spreading to other shops
4511821 the fire was pretty severe it was spectacular to watch but you feel upset for the owner
4511822 are considerably more thoughtful and measured than what weve seen from many of our peers

4511838 i take the note and saturday night live producer lorne michaels gave the note as well to me
4511839 its something we started this year and saw immediately copied by our competitors so we know that it worked a little bit
4511840 but obviously we need to modify it to ensure that we dont turn off any of the audience

4511844 its preseason and you sort of gauge yourself with where youre at

4511852 one method for exposing the inadequacies of the present is to hold it up against the past
4511853 and in the event that the present should be found lacking in comparison to the past this is not nostalgia it is critique

4511856 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4511857 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4511858 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4511859 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4511860 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4511861 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4511862 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4511863 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4511864 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4511865 appear to lack a sense of self considered a prerequisite for understanding the feelings of others

4511881 proof on why it is so important to be a critical thinker and the need to be in a 5 pillars company as a professional network marketer you will want to read this entire criminal case filed in florida asks to see if you may be in a ponzi or pyramid scheme as you read this criminal case 1 would a logical thinking person spend this amount of money on this product or service if there was not a pay plan attached to it 2 does the income stop when the recruiting stops there are thousands of people that have lost over 100 million dollars that would have been avoided if they had asked these two simple questions

4511884 for more than six years the army has been engaged in iraq and afghanistan and in defending the homeland
4511885 what has become clear is a need to expand soldiers abilities to speak critical languages to help us fight global terrorism this pilot program will help the army achieve that goal and meet our officer recruiting goals
4511886 factoring in only the public sector costs for maternity care delivery and one year of infant related care for those contraceptive clients who would be eligible for medicaid maternity care in their state if they became pregnant
4511887 at the same time the costs of birth have gone up as well
4511888 federal and state budgets are so tight it is important to demonstrate the savings for people who might be skeptical about the benefits that it is fiscally prudent it is not only a good thing to do it makes economic sense it can really help depoliticize an issue

4511892 today there are a lot more albums than 40 years ago it bossa nova is not at the top of the charts but it is still a style picked up by people of all ages
4511893 if somebody asks me today where they can hear bossa nova in rio i say nowhere the music is more popular in japan and europe than in brazil
4511894 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4511895 its a pity that when we are still faced with a most complicated situation to work on the united states is further aggravating the situation in relations with russia
4511896 russia is strong and russia has to be reckoned with
4511897 some of these books are so old they can hardly be opened
4511898 truly when the children come we just put the books out on the table
4511899 children could touch and feel and turn the pages and see how things were different
4511900 some of these books might not all be from the special collections library also
4511901 the right to a fair and public trial is a bedrock principle of democracy
4511902 unfortunately in this regard members of the armed services have fewer rights than those granted to criminal defendants in civilian courts
4511903 we believe that at a minimum the armed services should create an easily accessible docket of information listing those charged details regarding the charges against them and the date and time of their trials and pre trials
4511904 id rather move to canada than share the democratic party with those people
4511905 scientific research is advancing quickly and has made evident the need for an appropriate legal framework
4511906 elaborate proposals for optimising the legal structures and forms of organisation and participation
4511907 so far they have followed administrative regulations established by the national institute for excision and implants
4511908 very specific purposes and are not used for any purpose besides the one for which they were collected
4511909 im a supporter of first thinking about stimulating research and letting it be before controlling it
4511910 in the last few years interest in biological research with human material has developed very quickly because of the implications it could have
4511911 we are starting from zero because in mexico there are no precedents in this area
4511912 its obvious that we have to apply the standards on informed consent for the collection of samples norms on confidentiality of the data that emerge from those samples and standards for research on humans in general but there are no specific laws as of yet in colombia

4512124 the world market demand for lithium ion cells is presently at its highest point ever two major suppliers of this cell type had catastrophic fires in their assembly plants within the last year that severely diminished the available quantity to the world market the u s military requires a huge amount of this rechargeable energy source and the demand grows daily lyntronics is concerned as to how we will meet this demand and satisfy our contractual obligations currently there are no domestic producers of these cells and this is a situation which is not desirable a domestic source of lithium ion cells would help ensure that the supply to our military forces will not be jeopardized electro energys entry into this marketplace is timed perfectly we have tested and had the military test their product for use in our batteries and have concluded that their cells are well within specification we have therefore purchased a sizable quantity of cells to meet our ever increasing lithium ion needs

4512131 youd like to say the ball was slipping but i played in the snow last year and probably caught the ball better than i caught the ball all season long ive caught the ball in worse weather than that
4512132 fact of the matter is that i failed to make plays thats something that i personally have to work on i understand how it is youve got to make plays on special teams and right now im not doing that
4512133 i dont know that to tell you the truth i have to take a peek at the film i know that he dropped the ball and you cant do that thats where you have to start and once you do that you have to work to get yourself into position to catch it

4512146 we didnt play like we were the away team tonight only god knows what the next result will be but whatever happens we can head into the match in the positive frame of mind
4512147 we have already achieved our goal of reaching the last four and now we can start thinking about a medal

4512152 that will help in tackling the issues arising from a weakening in external demand
4512153 urban fixed asset investment has maintained a growth level of about 25 percent every month
4512154 domestic demand will certainly have to play the leading role in creating economic growth
4512155 its out of the question that current policy will be further tightened

4512161 in the pre requisites you list the b and o modules but those dont exist seperately on the cpan only as part of perl itself so dont need to be listed in fact listing them can confuse some build tools and if the user has a very old version of cpan pm it might even try to build a new perl for them
4512162 well honestly i think that you need to improve those build tools or otherwise cite some docs saying that it is illegal to list the modules in prereq pm which are part of perl
4512163 oh perls a buggy piece of shit ill use something else

4512166 commodities continue to fall off a cliff and the market likes it
4512167 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4512168 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4512169 the public health implication of these findings can be huge
4512170 considering the burden of diabetes and its multiple long term complications
4512171 by focusing on strategy of profitable growth we have maintained strong growth momentum of our key businesses in the first half of 2008 despite bearish financial market conditions and a challenging operating environment that lowered net profits this underlines the success of our model as an integrated financial corporation cross selling has become a real competitive advantage and are driving healthy growth across all of our businesses

4512175 the soaring prices of oil on the global level during these last six years have reminded us of the importance of safeguarding energy security in our homeland
4512176 were raising the energy supply capacity through accelerated energy diversification the utilisation of non fuel oil alternative energy including new and renewable energy such as micro hydro geothermal and biofuel
4512177 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy
4512178 the whole of society is expected to save whether in private offices or in households
4512179 this is a very significant amount as we can make use of it for the development of our education health infrastructure and even defence

4512189 residents of spruce drive a private road will get together and find a new name for their street
4512190 theres one on the east and one the west side of route 1a
4512191 so now they will be west atlantic avenue and east atlantic avenue the house numbers will remain the same
4512192 each house unit will now have a separate house number on ocean blvd
4512193 the numbers were arranged to match up with the current numbering system the numbers assigned to the breakers will run consecutively with the numbers on east side and will be consistent with the ones across the street the east side uses even numbers so the breakers will be odd and drivers will be able to follow the numbers you would not want to have say number 700 across the street from 401

4512195 barack obamas tax plan delivers broad based tax relief to middle class families and cuts taxes for small businesses and companies that create jobs in america while restoring fairness to our tax code and returning to fiscal responsibility coupled with obamas commitment to invest in key areas like health clean energy innovation and education his tax plan will help restore bottom up economic growth that helps create good jobs in america and empowers all families achieve the american dream obamas comprehensive tax policy plan for america will cut taxes for 95 percent of workers and their families with a tax cut of 500 for workers or 1 000 for working couples provide generous tax cuts for low and middle income seniors homeowners the uninsured and families sending a child to college or looking to save and accumulate wealth eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses cut corporate taxes for firms that invest and create jobs in the united states and provide tax credits to reduce the cost of healthcare and to reward investments in innovation dramatically simplify taxes by consolidating existing tax credits eliminating the need for millions of senior citizens to file tax forms and enabling as many as 40 million middle class americans to do their own taxes in less than five minutes without an accountant under the obama plan middle class families will see their taxes cut and no family making less than 250 000 will see their taxes increase the typical middle class family will receive well over 1 000 in tax relief under the obama plan and will pay tax rates that are 20 lower than they faced under president reagan according to the tax policy center the obama plan provides three times as much tax relief for middle class families as sen john mccains plan families making more than 250 000 will pay either the same or lower tax rates than they paid in the 1990s obama will ask the wealthiest 2 of families to give back a portion of the tax cuts they have received over the past eight years to ensure we are restoring fairness and returning to fiscal responsibility but no family will pay higher tax rates than they would have paid in the 1990s in fact dividend rates would be 39 percent lower than what president bush proposed in his 2001 tax cut obamas plan will cut taxes overall reducing revenues to below the levels that prevailed under ronald reagan less than 18 2 percent of gdp the obama tax plan is a net tax cut his tax relief for middle class families is larger than the revenue raised by his tax changes for families over 250 000 coupled with his commitment to cut unnecessary spending obama will pay for this tax relief while bringing down the budget deficit
4512196 the obama campaign has at long last lifted the veil of mystery that has surrounded the democratic presidential candidates tax increase plans mr obamas two economic advisers jason furman and austan goolsbee have an op ed piece in todays wall street journal and it isnt pretty to begin with they propose bringing back the 39 6 top income tax bracket an increase from the 35 current top rate on top of that hed impose a new payroll tax on those top earners of 2 to 4 bringing their marginal tax rate to as high as 43 6 add to that the top new york city income tax rate of 3 648 and the top new york state income tax rate of 6 85 and the nominal marginal income tax rate mounts to a staggering 54 because mr obama proposes to put the capital gains and dividend tax rate at 20 even for the rich a mere 33 increase over the current 15 rate expect to see plenty of high earners scurrying to find creative ways of structuring their income as capital gains or dividends rather than as earned income meanwhile the most astonishing sentence in the op ed is this one his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000 it amounts to a declaration of war on two income families a marriage penalty of punitive proportions if those two single persons with income just under 200 000 get married mr obama is going to hammer them with a huge tax increase if the second earner who in many cases is the woman is going to have to give 54 of what she earns to the government she might as well stay home with the children mr obama may be able to get away with symbolic slights to women such as not picking senator clinton as vice president but punishing them with confiscatory taxes for participating in the workforce at a high income level moves the slight into the realm of substance
4512197 aniboom is part of a first of its kind endeavor in which animators from all corners of the globe will be invited to collaboratively produce a computer generated animated short film for theatrical release
4512198 we thought something like this which may never happen again was worth documenting just in case something good happened
4512199 when in rome 2007 rolls out collins tells billboard com the trio is fairly convinced that something like last years tour will in fact never happen again
4512200 its a question of whether theres anything musically rather than touring to do
4512201 were all peddling quite slowly at the moment i like that phrase
4512202 you dont want to perceived as trying to flog stuff
4512203 when in rome 2007 via wal mart banks says the company offered a scenario that made sense to genesis for this project
4512204 the feeling is that in the states our records weve put out the various box sets and the live album live over europe 2007 and everything theyve done ok but not perhaps as well as we might have hoped
4512205 were really proud of this dvd and we dont want it to be forgotten about wal mart puts 100 000 of this dvd out there and feels like it can sell that many which i think will be an awful lot better than the last few things weve done you have to look at it that way
4512206 my clients worked in silicon valley during the tech boom
4512207 they are an ideal content partner to local businesses chambers of commerce local journalism outlets tourism services schools universities and cultural offerings they can be a real member of the community a real partner in local advertising marketing and content delivery these are monetized streams a model can be built around this thats really unique completely different from the basic connectivity service that consumers get from the big telco
4512208 think of why you go to your local pizza restaurant over the national chain because they know you because they offer you a targeted local experience and message
4512209 dont ask how you can compete with the telco ask what do i offer that the telco does not how can i compliment the telco
4512210 for a city to say you have to build a free network and oh maybe well use not right to ask a little company to be warren buffett
4512211 my advice to the city is make your city the place where any small emerging business isps included can grow into a much bigger one that will be a much greater source of pride for your city and will attract far more positive press than claiming free wi fi
4512212 businesses in emerging neighborhoods were paying 60 or more per month for cellular or landline service a not for profit organized a group seed funded via social venture monies to offer businesses something better for 29 95 broadband access plus the ability to accept credit debit cards and advertise both online and via the interactive kiosks
4512213 the isp offering connectivity to the services package connected the pieces it completed this success this package wasnt charity it was good business sense and could be offered citywide
4512214 we focused upon how broadband could expand local business success we did so in a way that could serve all communities alike rather than segregating certain people into a lesser offering wireless networks are not charity they are about doing business more effectively
4512215 the city would not have been able to build these relationships as quickly under a government program and an isp might not have the extra cash or time to spare to create the model and build the alliances and startup cash base
4512216 but in order to achieve them the city has to step aside and allow the private sector to go to work
4512217 work to enhance access to the mobile device with a local offering via the local isp create relevancy and generate interest through what is familiar
4512218 russian forces are occupying gori georgian armed forces received an order to leave gori and to fortify positions near mtskheta to defend the capital this is a total onslaught
4512219 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
4512220 is no longer a man that we can deal with
4512221 he must be punished for breaching international law he is responsible for many war crimes
4512222 nobody was listening and this is the result we have finally come to it however russia will of course carry out its peacekeeping mission to its logical end
4512223 it could spend time running parallel to the gulf stream over warm waters which these storms love and it could have the potential to become a major storm
4512224 that time will come one day youll see when we can all be friends

4512237 john mccains character courage record and life experience make him the best candidate of either party to meet todays challenges senator john mccain has a long standing pro life record whats more he has the ability to secure the republican nomination and to prevail against any democrat nominee each of which is strongly pro abortion here is the way we thought about our decision it was made at the intersection of three issues defense of the unborn defense of our nation from the islamic terrorists and electability when these issues are taken into consideration together we believe there is no candidate who is better than john mccain we urge all pro lifers to consider john mccain in precisely this way
4512238 right now mccain is skating on the thinnest of ice at best the election is tied in many polls he is 4 5 points down he has yet to crack 45 percent in any national poll and is behind in key states at worst he is facing a blowout now is not the time to pussyfoot around with a guy like tom ridge mccain is already suspect among social conservatives and picking a pro choicer will have the further effect of cooling whatever ardor he has been able to gin up among them mostly because of the fear of obama social conservatives are largely not for mccain they are against obama a lack of enthusiasm among mccain supporters could spell disaster for him come election day at the moment mccain can expect at least tepid support among faithful catholics those who go to mass at least once a week and who support the teachings of the church on core issues like abortion he needs this group to win the election he is putting them in an untenable position if he decides to pick ridge
4512239 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof

4512241 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
4512242 this whole thing again no pun with lindsay lohan dating samantha
4512243 now nobody was more of a fan of lesbians than my old boss bill clinton
4512244 while senator mccain and i do agree on the merits of the
4512245 once again this brings out senator mccains inability to view situations globally
4512246 so leta is it difficult to live your life so that whenever you need to illustrate a point you have an anecdote from your personal experience
4512247 besides obama had to know who ayers is and what he stands for especially with ayers making this splash on 9 11
4512248 i dont regret setting bombs bill ayers said i feel we didnt do enough mr ayers who spent the 1970s as a fugitive in the weather underground was sitting in the kitchen of his big turn of the 19th century stone house in the hyde park district of chicago
4512249 the funding will go towards supporting projects in the telecommunication mining infrastructure and other key sectors of the pta banks member states
4512250 this funding will support the banks regional business support strategy especially in sectors that require a large amount of funding such as mining telecommunications and infrastructure
4512251 the developmental impact of improving telecommunication networks cannot be underestimated and because we are a development bank it is our intention to continue being very active in this sector
4512252 to date we have committed close to 90 million usd to the telecommunications sector in the sub region
4512253 its our goal to make every phone smart as long as you have a cellular signal you are in the know we make content easy to access when you want it not a fan of sms we can email you your favorite information
4512254 given the enormous benefits we have seen from a lightly regulated internet and software market our government should refrain from imposing burdensome regulation
4512255 john mccain will focus on policies that leave consumers free to access the content they choose free to use the applications and services they choose free to attach devices they choose if they do not harm the network and free to chose among broadband service providers
4512256 while the internet has provided tremendous opportunity for the creators of copyrighted works including music and movies to distribute their works around the world at low cost it has also given rise to a global epidemic of piracy
4512257 john mccain supports efforts to crack down on piracy both on the internet and off
4512258 international agreements and enforcement efforts that ensure fair rewards to intellectual property
4512259 too much protection can stifle the proliferation of important ideas and impair legitimate commerce in new products to the detriment of our entire economy

4512290 yo s que formo parte del gobierno y que vengo de otro sector de otro espacio pol tico y por ah esto me permite disentir en algunas cosas esto es la pluralidad esto es actuar de acuerdo con las convicciones que uno tiene quiero pedir que eval en la posibilidad de un cuarto intermedio para encontrar una soluci n que es la que est esperando la ciudadan a le pido a la presidenta de los argentinos que tiene la posibilidad de enviar un nuevo proyecto que contemple todo lo que se ha dicho que contemple todos los aportes que se han brindado

4512295 con la creaci n del banco central afirma jauretche se completaba la pol tica dirigista de la d cada infame pero aqu est la madre del borrego el banco central aparec a como un banco de estado rector solo que el estado no ten a funci n rectora los liberales eran dirigistas pero para impedir que el pa s se dirigiera a s mismo

4512344 the caspian region is wondering what this means for the future
4512345 a trans caspian gas pipeline can be considered a forever buried chimera
4512346 it became clear for all the participants of these energy games that nothing will go through the caspian sea
4512347 niyazov thought about it and probably decided he didnt want to wake up dead
4512348 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4512349 can somebody explain why georgians decided to attack s ossetia
4512350 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interests
4512351 with current opec production well above the expected demand for opec crude there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories
4512352 customers are basing decisions on significantly lower oil prices and they plan very long term projects that dont switch on or switch off based on the oil price
4512353 i dont really see it having a major impact on our business
4512354 ive had to hunt all over to find the volume of wood i need
4512355 the chainsaws need gas the log splitters need gas and the trucks use diesel fuel so the price is up
4512356 going forward people should not assume this is more than a temporary break in prices
4512357 they should make buying decisions the homes they buy their vehicles they should make those decisions with an eye toward more expensive petroleum in the future probably because there will be a little less of it
4512358 prudent energy management during an era of depleting petroleum resources
4512359 by 2050 the prediction is that 50 per cent of the worlds arable land may be unusable due to over irrigation and over grazing
4512360 in the medium term it is inevitable that energy prices will rise even higher and the industry needs to think of the costs of that and the effect on its carbon footprint
4512361 the demand side is a major concern supplies from opec countries are rising but there is a shortage of buyers the industrial use in china has been cut back
4512362 it seems normal to do things that still strike other parts of the country as awfully different
4512363 the industry is growing too fast i cant help but worry
4512364 as demand increases prices increase and when prices increase companies develop and produce more oil which can slow the peak
4512365 as demand increases prices increase and when prices increase companies develop and produce more oil which can slow the peak were getting better at finding oil and more efficient at drilling it

4512390 it sort of takes the work we do on a weekly basis with the girls and sends a very confusing signal to them
4512391 we talk about media images the differences the reality and how media can create images that arent necessarily realistic
4512392 we try to give them internal strength to respond to those mixed messages and images
4512393 actually what was being portrayed in the opening ceremony swap is an unfortunate thing that happens more than we want to admit in our society
4512394 certainly the words attractive or pretty can do a job on kids self esteem and can make them feel less adequate and really does send a poor message
4512395 we want every woman out there to realize they have potential and we want to portray those women in our advertising
4512396 clearly theres an interest in opening that conversation and finding a way to help girls deal with media images and the confusion ms garfinkel said

4512400 the best way to characterize scott he had quite a sense of humor
4512401 it was very subtle it wasnt overbearing he always could laugh at a tough situation he would make people feel better about a tough deal
4512402 some people that know their stuff theyll talk down to you make you feel like youre very little but not with scott
4512403 he had quite a good rapport with many officers throughout the entire state hes the type of person that when he taught the class officers were at the edge of their seat the entire time
4512404 he just went out and did his job he was one of the better employees ive ever had the opportunity to know its a big loss for the whole law enforcement community
4512405 but hes one that believed in the laws of the land and he felt like people should live them he lived rules and enforced rules but was also obedient to rules he did everything he could to comply with the laws of god and the laws of man

4512410 you are a young man who is fascinated by firearms as evidenced by the nature of the rap music recorded on your mobile phone and sketches you drew of rifles
4512411 you also revealed to someone that you were in possession of other firearms worth 4 000
4512412 it is apparent to every citizen in this country that firearm offences have increased markedly and all too often they are in the hands of young men such as you who seem to think carrying a weapon and terrifying people is somehow acceptable
4512413 the message must go out to others similarly inclined that they will receive prison sentences of significant length

4512422 as a pastor i knew you could learn a lot about a mans character based on how he treats his family barrack is a strong man of christian faith who has been married to his wife michelle for 16 years and he is the proud father of two beautiful daughters he understands the pressure families are under and what it takes to help families thrive throughout his entire career sen obama has stood by families including his own and as president hell stand by yours

4512427 i just want to score one to get me going
4512428 it will be difficult because they are top class defenders but i believe in my own ability and feel i can cause problems
4512429 hopefully i can score and get us something out of the game pace will always be a big threat to defenders i will give it my all and try and be the best player i can be
4512430 i dont really think anytime is good to play them theyve got a few injuries but they still have great players coming in it doesnt matter about their age because they all have great ability even the 17 and 18 year olds

4512479 it seems to me that we get scandal after scandal in various areas and yet we keep on getting told that we dont need an anti corruption commission in victoria

4512481 we have had allegations of corruption in the police force we have had allegations of corruption in local government and now we have damning allegations of corruption in the racing industry

4512489 we can make inquiries about negligence allegations but weve got no power to order compensation
4512490 anyones entitled to challenge anything we do and were very confident that anything we are doing is above industry standards
4512491 in effect theyve sequestered the place as a quarantine station and prevented me from doing any work theyre effectively renting my property
4512492 more young people must be encouraged to take up these roles
4512493 given the youthful indigenous age profile the best way to expand the decision making zone is to target youth leadership and governance initiatives to children at school or through various other youth activities

4512496 the completion of the sewage plants for byron bay and bangalow the extension of the myocum tip the repair of roads and bridges and the planning and funding in place for new projects such as the byron bay library
4512497 i frankly didnt feel the greens were green enough for me theyve concentrated too much on chasing some so called middle ground and thats meant cosying up to the business community and ignoring the grassroots in the community i dont think its the way to go
4512498 in all those years we were ripe for sacking or amalgamation
4512499 just to have survived as a council is a big achievement
4512500 weve shown that greens can be economically responsible weve also realised youve got to take people with you when youre in a minority position its easy to state strong views about how things should be but its different when youve actually got to implement them
4512501 i get on well with jan personally but philosophically were poles apart
4512502 balancing the books is great but they havent done anything while theyre there
4512503 better off overall than had we recommended a freeze in the tariff
4512504 our clear recommendation is that this should be all that is required
4512505 an australian car industry that is greener more responsive to the demands of the market employs more people and exports more

4512507 in the time between mr bracks finalising this report and it being made public today the doha round of trade talks has collapsed
4512508 that changes one of the key assumptions in this report and we think the government should rethink and adopt a phased or staged approach to tariff reductions
4512509 a key part of the rudd governments plan to address the challenges faced in the murray darling basin is making the water market more efficient so water can move to where it brings the most benefits
4512510 some irrigation infrastructure operators impose high termination fees on farmers who elect to sell their water and terminate water delivery rights
4512511 high termination fees prevent farmers from realising the market value of their water entitlements and deter trade in water
4512512 any of these issues of restricting the trade means that there isnt a full trading opportunity across the states
4512513 when they signed up to the national water initiative governments talked about the need for open trade
4512514 things like these fees are an impediment to that trade
4512515 theres third party impact as a result of water trade
4512516 theres impact on those who wish to remain as irrigators and also on the communities that in many cases have been built on irrigated agriculture
4512517 we suspect in nsw there are above 400 infrastructure operators
4512518 that goes down to a handful of farmers on a shared channel they might only have one pump and five farms but they are an infrastructure operator theyve got shared costs between them so if one farmer decides to move out then potentially the costs are all raised to an extent that the other farms are all no longer viable
4512519 it is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so little useless information

4512523 we only have one opportunity as a community to do this correctly and we need to be strategic about where assets are placed we also need to think through all of the amenities all of the challenges and all of the infrastructure needs we will be facing in advance of having to face them
4512524 the mission of the mca foundation is to improve access to quality healthcare in the paso del norte region by building a better healthcare infrastructure providing superior healthcare educational opportunities and attracting retaining researchers and healthcare providers to the region
4512525 the mca foundation will work to master plan and facilitate the development of an integrated campus of medical facilities adjacent to the new and expanding university medical center at thomason and the texas tech university health sciences center paul l
4512526 this cluster of properties including hospitals educational programs research laboratories medical office buildings healthcare related non profit organizations along with a new free standing non profit childrens hospital will build the mca on the same level as some of the finest medical centers in the country
4512527 some of the challenges other medical centers are facing have to do with lack of planning far enough into the future so we want to look forward 20 years 50 years and 100 years so we anticipate as many of our needs as possible
4512528 i would say this is a significant step what follows will be different types of challenges but it was important to think through how we want to grow and how we should grow
4512529 the next challenge will be probably more significant because we then will have to start to tackle some of the issues head on the railroad is a big challenge we have to start thinking through land acquisition we need to recruit businesses and other health care assets to the area
4512530 i support the medical center of the americas additionally i support the growth around the surrounding area i also support encouraging new businesses and restaurants to relocate to the surrounding area including the development of housing for medical students
4512531 a fundamentally different approach to economic development than weve had in the past im very excited about the very significant institutional and business leadership lining up behind this project
4512532 over the long term well have to decide what the vision is and how as a community we support the vision
4512533 one of the most ambitious economic development projects in el pasos history mired in politics and semi moribund for the past couple of years is about to reemerge the project the medical center of the americas would cluster medical assets in the area now dominated by thomason and texas tech
4512534 the project is picking up steam with more details made public at a meeting of the mayors medical cabinet april 12 the city will be asked to help fund a master plan to begin in september and be finished in march 2007 meanwhile tech and thomason proceed with their growth plans
4512535 the hunt family foundation has donated 500 000 to the medical center of the americas foundation the following is a news release regarding the donation
4512536 for the second time since utep signed on as a partner in the proposed medical center in the late 90s the ut system has decided to place a major health related asset on the utep campus instead of the medical center of the americas a site anchored by thomason and texas tech in central el paso but this time the mca has its own momentum
4512537 an exchange of letters two from this week between business leader woody hunt and state sen eliot shapleigh sheds light on some of the issues involved in building a medical center in el paso and that medical centers relationship with utep

4512546 this evenings launch of amc 21 is a great achievement beginning with the ordering of the spacecraft in the spring of 2006 to its launch today the entire mission was completed in 27 months it is also a proud moment for the thales orbital team who partnered to build and deliver an exceptional spacecraft and for the ariane team who has just launched its 30th spacecraft for ses
4512547 we now look forward to bringing amc 21 into service as we will be establishing a new ku band enterprise and broadcast neighborhood in the north american arc at 125 degrees west anchoring the new satellite will be the public broadcasting service and several of their local broadcast affiliates the satellite will also be used for new applications such as maritime mobile broadband
4512548 amc 21 was the result of some unique design requirements established by ses which allowed thales and orbital to partner and play to our mutual strengths for this particular mission
4512549 our relationship with ses has been successful for more than a decade and we are now looking ahead to the fall 2008 launch of ciel 2 for the ses canadian affiliate ciel satellite group
4512550 i would like to thank ses for having the confidence that arianespace would deliver amc 21 safely into orbit amc 21 is the thirtieth satellite that arianespace launched for ses a successful collaboration of more than two dozen years
4512551 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4512552 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4512553 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4512554 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4512555 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4512556 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere

4512563 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4512564 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4512565 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4512566 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4512567 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4512568 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars
4512569 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4512570 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4512571 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4512572 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth

4512593 instead of having one or two sources for information students today have thousands of resources at their fingertips

4512636 we saw that last season not many people thought that reading and birmingham would go down its all media speculation at this stage
4512637 were very pleased that were at home first the big question is how quickly we gel together
4512638 individually we are all good players but that will not win you the game as a team i believe we have a very big chance to beat fulham

4512657 i was a prosecutor before being elected directly to the senate and i thought it was important to keep some continuity
4512658 he doesnt take for granted that the peopkle of the fifth congressional district will rehire him so in addition to working hard for their interests he keeps his law license current just in case he may need to take care of his family

4512680 simple cost shifting by the state to the counties for delivering state mandated services
4512681 the difference could spell property tax increases for new yorks overburdened homeowners and businesses
4512682 lets be clear here they are not cutting aid to counties they are cutting the reimbursements for programs that county governments are required by state statute to deliver we still have to spend taxpayer money to deliver the states programs the difference is that we just have less of the states funding to pay for it
4512683 if we are going to make the hard choices to address the current economic situation then we need to reduce state programs and services not simply shift more costs to property taxpayers
4512684 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4512685 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4512686 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4512687 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4512688 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4512689 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4512690 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4512691 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4512692 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4512693 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4512694 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4512695 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4512696 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4512697 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4512698 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4512699 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4512700 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4512701 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4512702 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4512703 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4512704 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4512705 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4512706 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4512707 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4512708 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4512709 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4512710 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4512711 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
4512712 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4512713 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night how could this happen
4512714 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4512715 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4512716 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4512717 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4512718 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4512719 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4512720 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4512721 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4512722 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4512723 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4512724 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4512725 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4512726 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4512727 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4512728 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4512735 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
4512736 we believe tv content can be positive and responsible and still have good ratings with great content
4512737 i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob johnson and learned the tv game from one of the best in the business

4512751 they ask questions share knowledge and build a community of practice that nasa hopes will lead them to pursue careers in fields critical to nasa and the nation
4512752 why do we see a difference between the objects hitting the ground and the big objects whizzing by
4512753 we finally had a big enough data set that the statistics demanded an answer it could no longer be just a coincidence
4512754 we think the yarkovsky effect is so efficient for meter size objects that it can operate on all regions of the asteroid belt
4512755 odds are an object we might have to deal with would be like an ll chondrite and thanks to our samples in the laboratory we can measure its properties in detail
4512756 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4512757 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4512758 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4512759 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4512760 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4512761 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4512762 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4512763 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4512764 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4512765 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
4512766 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region
4512767 this evenings launch of amc 21 is a great achievement beginning with the ordering of the spacecraft in the spring of 2006 to its launch today the entire mission was completed in 27 months it is also a proud moment for the thales orbital team who partnered to build and deliver an exceptional spacecraft and for the ariane team who has just launched its 30th spacecraft for ses
4512768 we now look forward to bringing amc 21 into service as we will be establishing a new ku band enterprise and broadcast neighborhood in the north american arc at 125 degrees west anchoring the new satellite will be the public broadcasting service and several of their local broadcast affiliates the satellite will also be used for new applications such as maritime mobile broadband
4512769 amc 21 was the result of some unique design requirements established by ses which allowed thales and orbital to partner and play to our mutual strengths for this particular mission
4512770 our relationship with ses has been successful for more than a decade and we are now looking ahead to the fall 2008 launch of ciel 2 for the ses canadian affiliate ciel satellite group
4512771 i would like to thank ses for having the confidence that arianespace would deliver amc 21 safely into orbit amc 21 is the thirtieth satellite that arianespace launched for ses a successful collaboration of more than two dozen years
4512772 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4512773 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4512774 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4512775 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4512776 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time

4512779 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4512780 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4512781 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4512782 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4512783 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4512784 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4512835 parliamentarians it seems have turned over much of their accountability responsibilities to officers of parliament and to the media
4512836 parliament is the one institution that truly should matter to canadians the only one that constitutes the democratic link between citizens and their government and connects citizens from and so it is in parliament we must address the current weaknesses of our common political life

4512839 no i am listening to you because you arent saying anything important and you say that so much its become white noise to me
4512840 ok fine here i think that if we are going to try this again we should learn to let things go starting with everything youve brought up in this conversation if you cant do that or if you are bringing them up because you think they might be a problem in the future then i strongly suggest we reconsider the whole affair based on its obvious impracticality

4512892 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4512908 hit a shot that hit fernandos racket and then went out the umpire didnt see that it hit his racket playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4512909 i make mistakes but i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4512910 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it how much i love the other athletes what theyve sacrificed and you appreciate that and the guys go out and compete their hardest win fair and square lose fair and square thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4512911 if im 100 percent sure about it i will give it
4512912 the umpire did not see the incident clearly and therefore it was a matter between the two players
4512913 and thats where i feel like tennis and golf you call those things on yourself
4512914 so yes maybe i did expect a little more out of the olympics maybe i wouldnt have expected this at the u s open or something but to be honest if the roles were reversed id call it on myself because i know if i ever didnt i came off the court im still the same little kid if i came off the court and my parents saw me do that i wouldnt have the racket they wouldnt let me pick up the racket for weeks theyd punish me for not playing the game the way its supposed to be played
4512915 what we need to do is get this out in the public and get rid of those who arent cooperating

4512936 we expect higher balance borrowers to receive both rate relief and increased liquidity as was desired in the legislation while retaining the overall liquidity of the tba market
4512937 preserves the overall homogeneity of the market while at the same time minimizing the risk of a negative impact on mortgage rates for lower balance loan borrowers or potentially all borrowers
4512938 it bodes well for overall gdp gross domestic product growth in june returning to positive growth after the disappointing 0 1 per cent drop in may
4512939 going forward activity in manufacturing will be helped by rising new orders particularly for aerospace products and the recent depreciation of the canadian dollar
4512940 the bottom line is that even in spite of the lower canadian dollar manufacturing sales are likely to remain weak until at least the spring of 2009 when the u s economy begins to show improvement
4512941 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4512942 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4512943 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4512944 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works

4512963 obviously were pleased that the jury felt she had a meritorious case
4512964 dr lebed gave up after a lot of pain and tears
4512965 nerve injury caused by removal of an implantable hormonal contraceptive
4512966 implanon a brand of contraceptive implant rods insertion and removal are relatively uncomplicated procedures in the hands of medical professionals familiar with the technique however injury to branches of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve during implanon insertion and removal can result in impaired sensibility severe localized pain or the formation of painful neuroma that can be quite devastating to the patient
4512967 in the event that an injury to the nerve is recognized immediate plastic surgical measures should be undertaken to avoid displeasing sequels of nerve injuries therefore the benefit of this generally well tolerated highly effective and relatively cost efficient contraception is guaranteed only in the hands of medical professionals familiar with the technique
4512968 the hardware was correct and everything held the only problem was she didnt need it and it worsened her condition
4512969 the lack of a teaching office in the episcopalian church has resulted in communicating un baptized persons same sex unions and liturgical chaos everywhere
4512970 there are no boundaries and it is all uncontrollable this is not theory but day to day reality
4512971 we came to realize that like the prodigal son in the gospel it is up to us to make the initiative to return to the rock from whence we were hewn
4512972 the need for perusing unity with the see of peter now
4512973 these discussions between the roman catholic church and the anglican communion have been going on for 42 years
4512974 we would like to bring these down to the local level
4512975 they make it clear that they no longer believe there is truth in the anglican communion and the only way they can find truth is reunion with rome
4512976 you have a system thats supposed to strengthen airport security but you dont use the results of the tests to do exactly what youre doing the tests for
4512977 live coverage of a georgian journalist being shot by a russian troop
4512978 she said the only thing she remembers is she went to go lay down to take a nap and the next thing she remembers is a brief flash of her being arrested the next thing she physically remembers is her being in jail
4512979 this is a breakthrough into the market a first pilot plant in england
4512980 we start with one to show the authorities how our technology works if it succeeds well have a lot more
4512981 the first is landfill but there you lose the land and the waste and it pollutes ground water
4512982 the second is incineration but that leaves over fly ash and bottom ash in huge quantities bottom ash is incinerated again and can eventually be used for construction
4512983 our process is a chemical one not burning the waste is reduced to 4 percent of its mass which can then become construction building blocks ninety six percent turns into gas which powers the plant itself
4512984 the price for landfills is subsidized in israel to nis 100 nis 120 per ton in england the price is 120 per ton or six times as much in germany it is 200 and in the us it is 250
4512985 if the government did a correct assessment of cost of land pollution and all the factors then they would come to a real price
4512986 not yet enough governmental interest to make it worthwhile in israel
4512987 let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream
4512988 in a certain city there was a judge who did not fear god and did not respect man
4512989 for a while he was unwilling but afterward he said to himself even though i do not fear god nor respect man yet because this widow bothers me i will give her legal protection otherwise by continually coming she will wear me out
4512990 i tell you that he will bring about justice for them quickly however when the son of man comes will he find the faith on the earth
4512991 when the son of man comes will he find the faith on the earth
4512992 the nhl for 15 years has brought young players from europe first and foremost from russia
4512993 i think that it is time to end this simply put its time to stop robbing us
4512994 but if the theoretical limit is higher you can presume that the real figure that you will be able to reach will also be higher
4512995 theoretical predictions are only the beginning of the long process to realisation of practical solar cells
4512996 have you seen what they use to hike its efficiency titanium i guess thats a very plentiful and cheap mineral so go ahead
4512997 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4512998 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4512999 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4513000 as long as the ownership group is having fun and putting a good product on the ice ill be here for a while

4513004 not only licensing schemes requiring speech to be submitted to an administrative censor for prepublication review but also injunctions against future speech issued by judges
4513005 the injunction is allowing us to review the research that they have and see if there is any validity to their findings and take corrective action if any is even necessary
4513006 who are americans to point out racism abroad when we have our own issues with racism

4513008 hemos intentado que no se dieran cuenta los sudafricanos de nuestra problema pero no ha podido ser porque la piragua era ingobernable y cuando nos han pasado nos ha sido imposible aguantar el ritmo
4513009 ha sido m s dura que el a o pasado ya que el r o llevaba un caudal superior y la calidad de los contrincantes era alt sima
4513010 the unions were warned that they must respond positively to the council and arrange an early ballot but despite promises no date has been set
4513011 therefore the council has written to the unions telling them that the offer has been withdrawn and the council reserves the right unilaterally to implement part or all of the offer as it thinks fit
4513012 consideration is being given to this now and further communications will be issued as decisions are made
4513013 son las que en los ltimos a os han accedido a la compra de una vivienda al ver que les sub a el precio del alquiler y que ahora se han encontrado con que suben los intereses mientras bajan sus ingresos por el paro de uno o de ambos c nyuges y se produce una subida general de todos sus gastos

4513017 muy preocupadas porque se est incrementando la demanda y no se sabe hasta donde se va a poder llegar
4513018 nuestros fondos son de gente que de buena voluntad nos presta ayuda pero la crisis tambi n les llega y se nota que pueden contribuir con menos
4513019 si una familia se queda parada la nica soluci n es el trabajo

4513021 it is a political event but it is also a national event that has an impact on the city of philadelphia i mean im going to work
4513022 too many times we only hear about the negative news of our world that extends to truck drivers who are truly misunderstood for the role they play in moving freight from the factories to our homes
4513023 we see todays truck driver as the brave men and women who make our highways safer and drive our economy they truly are americas unsung heroes and we want to honor them
4513024 the highway hero program is for those who selflessly risk life and limb to come to the aid of fellow motorists or who make the world a better place for all anyone can nominate a truck driver for this high honor
4513025 that way we are not dependent on one part of the market
4513026 really friendly place where everyone knows each other a really important employer for the area
4513027 making cheese is an alchemy as you change liquid into a solid

4513030 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4513031 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4513032 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4513033 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4513034 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4513035 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4513036 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4513037 characteristic of those having an inflated idea of their own importance
4513038 i know youre really busy but can you guest post for me while im on vacation
4513039 well it will be tough because you know i have kids and a job and a business and a life and church but for you i will see if i can carve some time out of my busy day to help you out because its the christian thing to do
4513040 oh my gosh of course ill guest post for you ill ignore my children and not cook dinner and miss getting them to football practice for days because ill lament over what i should write and then whether or not its good enough for your blog
4513041 removing a grounded vessel is a complex process that takes time and hard work

4513112 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet

4513114 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4513115 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4513116 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4513117 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4513136 oregonians are suffering from the unintended consequences of this new law
4513137 in 2009 we will work to repeal this costly ethanol mandate that is failing to work for oregon
4513138 everyone recognizes the potential of biofuels as a renewable energy source but the mandated use of corn based ethanol is causing more problems than it is solving
4513139 our proposal offers oregonians relief from this mandate it also allows the legislature to seek and promote more efficient sources of energy to power our state
4513140 sometimes these new initiatives though well intentioned need to be better vetted in the legislative process

4513153 it is abhorrent to our concept of personal freedom that the process of civil contempt can be used to jail a person indefinitely possibly for life even though he or she refuses to comply with the courts order c ontinued imprisonment may reach a point where it becomes more punitive than coercive and thereby defeats the purpose of the commitment
4513154 because the state courts have repeatedly found that mr chadwick has the present ability to comply with the july 1994 state court order we cannot disturb the state courts decision that there is no federal constitutional bar to mr chadwicks indefinite confinement for civil contempt so long as he retains the ability to comply with the order requiring him to pay over the money at issue
4513155 my god if he had stolen 2 million he would have been out a couple of years ago
4513156 a dozen pleas to the county courts nine to state appeals courts nine to the pennsylvania supreme court six to the nearby federal court four to the third circuit court of appeals and two to the u s supreme court
4513157 the civil law tradition an introduction to the legal systems of western europe and latin america
4513158 another fundamental difference between the civil law and common law traditions occurs in enforcement proceedings civil law jurisdictions have nothing comparable to the common law notion of civil contempt of court i n the common law a person can be compelled to act or to refrain from acting by the threat of imprisonment or fine for contempt of court that is for refusing to obey a court order addressed to him or her as a person the civil law by way of contrast knows no civil contempt of court and tends to operate solely in rem this means that regardless of the type of claim one has against another person the only way one can collect the claim is by obtaining a money judgment
4513159 in all criminal prosecution the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed and to have the assistance of counsel
4513160 no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation
4513161 no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws
4513162 when the responsibilities of lawmaker prosecutor judge jury and disciplinarian are thrust upon a judge he is obviously incapable of holding the scales of justice perfectly fair and true and reflecting impartially on the guilt or innocence of the accused he truly becomes the judge of his own cause
4513163 no person shall be imprisoned for debt in any civil action or mesne or final process unless in cases of fraud
4513164 it would be no overstatement to say that the offense with the most ill defined and elastic contours in our law is now punished by the harshest procedures known to that law
4513165 on the other hand our success was largely contributed by the increase in the votes from the indian community followed by the chinese and the malays
4513166 apple inc is working on a software fix for its new iphone 3g to remedy dropped phone calls that some users are experiencing according to people familiar with the matter
4513167 glitches are common for new entrants in the mobile phone business one of the most technically challenging categories of products for which to write reliable software code but the effectiveness and speed with which apple comes up with a solution for the dropped calls could affect the long term success of the iphone an important growth market for the company apple introduced the iphone 3g which offers faster internet access speeds than the original version of the device on july 11
4513168 its not about whether you have problems or dont have them said ken dulaney a mobile analyst at research firm gartner inc

4513175 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4513176 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4513177 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4513178 a looming energy disaster with lives hanging in the balance currently eight million homes rely on heating oil during the winter months and last winters prices forced too many citizens to choose between heat food and medicine
4513179 teachers dont know what to expect for our schools or how to plan for our students
4513180 thats why lawmakers need to put the partisan bickering asside and pass a common sense budget that raises revenue to protect education
4513181 as a parent and a republican its time for my letislator to listen to me about schools not the republican leaders in sacramento
4513182 call your legislator and tell them to suppport the compromise budget today

4513226 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4513227 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4513228 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4513229 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air

4513239 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq
4513240 of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4513241 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4513242 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint
4513243 in his statement to the house of commons on 22 july the prime minister set out the intent to make a fundamental change to the uk mission in iraq in the first months of 2009
4513244 as ever this will be based on conditions on the ground the plans of our coalition partners and the military contribution requested of us by the government of iraq under a long term bilateral relationship
4513245 as a key coalition partner the us is intimately involved with the development of our future plans
4513246 and as american general david petraeus stressed in his recent interview with the times the us is fully supportive of the uks current position on iraq and of our proposals for iraqs future
4513247 british troops and their families must be fed up of the series of nods and winks on withdrawal which often turn out to have no substance
4513248 our forces lives are on the line and it is about time that the government gave them some definite decisions rather than vague hopes
4513249 even if this latest hint turns out to be true the timescale seems far too slow our troops should be home from iraq by christmas at the very latest
4513250 i had the opportunity to sell a few players but they wouldnt go
4513251 pedro was way up on the list of players i wanted to sell
4513252 the ones i could have sold had good opportunities to move to good clubs and they didnt want to move
4513253 theyre probably in the comfort zone here and theyre quite happy not to be in the team but to just do their little bit and plod along
4513254 but with pedro its a move he fancied when it was put to him and its a move we had to do financially so we move on
4513255 european football this season is definitely going to be a good experience for me

4513265 its important to us to clearly reflect how the city is using taxpayer resources and our finance department does a wonderful job of that in the annual reports
4513266 its important in the sense that it says we do a pretty good job of accurately portraying the financial status of the city

4513349 i have this recollection of somebody asking me for lawyers in new york and i remember naming three or four and he must have been one of them
4513350 it was either her who called or somebody on her behalf
4513351 i remember getting a call from pam and her telling me that she was representing him
4513352 i may have sent him over there but on the other hand i may not have i dont have an accurate recollection
4513353 i have a brief recollection of giving someone some cash my assumption is i loaned some small amount of money to the both of them
4513354 ms hunter called me i represent her and only her as i would any client
4513355 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations

4513357 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4513358 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well

4513362 my feet are not in the same position they have been in for the first 30 years of my life so it is kind of putting them in a new position and they are not comfortable with it they are sore i think i will be all right

4513372 the chinese economy isnt going to suddenly grind to a halt when the olympic flame is snuffed out
4513373 in fact i believe the olympics are chinas springboard to even more impressive growth with the nation of 1 3 billion at center stage look for the world to fall even more in love with the opportunity
4513374 still not convinced then ask yourself this simple question would global giants like yum brands mcdonalds and nike among countless others invest so heavily in a country whose growth could potentially dry up overnight absolutely not
4513375 in fact roughly 450 companies recently told the american chamber of commerce in beijing that china was among their top three global investment priorities many regard china as their top priority and you can bet the conclusions were based on mountains of favorable data
4513376 as incomes started to rise the chinese consumer started well buying first it was refrigerators then televisions then air conditioners and now its cars so the next logical purchase in the natural progression is real estate
4513377 to play the imminent boom go with the century 21 of china e house its chinas largest real estate agency services firm with 1 800 professionals in more than 20 cities
4513378 most important to us however is that its grossly undervalued in october shares traded for an eye popping price to earnings ratio of 91 today e house trades for less than 19 times historical earnings and roughly nine times forward earnings
4513379 thats a steal considering earnings should rise by 50 or more for the next five years indeed not too many opportunities come along to buy growth this cheaply
4513380 e house has been battling the misperception of getting lumped together with the withering u s real estate market
4513381 however a recent proposal by the chinese government to levy a new tax based on property values rather than just on transactions as it does now is the real culprit behind the decline
4513382 while the chinese government wants to cool excessive speculation there is no way that it will do anything to deepen the slide of its stock market im not the only person who feels that way the ceo of e house is buying back shares on the open market
4513383 and get this e house has a peg price earnings to growth ratio of only 0 32 any peg below 1 0 means that you are getting a ton of profits for peanuts
4513384 we are going to use this opportunity to average down and lower our cost basis in one of our holdings e house china holdings ltd
4513385 e house is chinas largest real estate company its been an extremely volatile stock since going public just about a year ago
4513386 it hit a high of 36 45 on 10 31 07 and has been as low as 9 40 the company is supposed to earn 0 82 per share this year and 1 11 per share next year they are growing extremely fast and the stock is cheap
4513387 we are switching our strategy in this stock from a buy and hold to strategic trading we will use the volatility to our advantage if the stock runs up very fast in a short amount of time we will keep a tighter stop underneath it

4513394 it can be a challenge for college students to manage their finances when they first head off to school says steve katz director of consumer education for transunions truecredit
4513395 while flexing their independence some flex their wallets too thats why its so important for parents to sit down with their kids well before the school year begins to map out a spending plan parents and students should determine how much they will have to spend each month how it should be allocated and should discuss what happens if they run short on money

4513434 the bill does not provide where the tracks will be built but i would think they would be built somewhere near the two greyhound tracks
4513435 that way people will have two more conveniently located tracks not to go to
4513436 i had an experience with a yorkshire terrier that was given bacon every morning for breakfast
4513437 anything greasy fatty or salty is not good the dog would end up skipping meals waiting on the bacon

4513464 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4513465 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4513468 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4513469 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4513470 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4513471 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4513472 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4513473 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4513474 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4513475 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4513476 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4513477 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4513478 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4513479 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4513480 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4513481 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush

4513485 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives

4513487 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4513488 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4513489 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4513490 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4513491 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4513492 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4513493 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4513494 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4513495 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4513496 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4513497 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4513498 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4513499 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4513500 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4513501 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4513502 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4513503 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4513504 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4513505 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4513506 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4513507 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4513508 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4513509 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4513510 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4513511 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4513512 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4513513 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4513514 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4513515 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4513516 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4513517 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4513518 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4513519 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4513520 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4513521 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4513522 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4513523 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4513524 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4513525 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4513526 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4513527 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4513528 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4513529 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4513530 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4513531 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4513532 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4513533 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4513534 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4513535 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4513536 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4513537 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4513538 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4513539 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4513540 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4513541 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4513542 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4513543 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4513544 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4513545 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4513546 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4513547 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4513548 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4513549 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4513550 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4513551 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4513552 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4513553 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4513554 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4513555 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4513556 take on the complexity of managing security and fraud protection
4513557 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4513558 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4513559 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4513560 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4513561 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4513562 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4513563 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4513564 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4513565 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4513566 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4513567 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4513568 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4513569 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4513570 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4513571 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4513572 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4513573 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4513574 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4513575 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4513576 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4513577 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4513578 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4513579 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4513580 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4513581 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4513582 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4513583 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4513584 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4513585 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4513586 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4513587 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4513588 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4513589 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4513590 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4513591 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4513592 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4513593 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4513594 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4513595 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4513596 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4513597 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4513598 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4513599 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4513600 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4513601 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4513602 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4513603 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4513604 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4513605 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4513606 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4513607 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4513608 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4513609 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4513610 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4513611 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4513612 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4513613 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4513614 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4513615 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4513616 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4513617 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4513618 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4513619 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4513620 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4513621 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4513622 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4513623 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4513624 just so you all know we did set a record
4513625 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4513626 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4513627 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4513628 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4513629 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4513630 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4513631 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4513632 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4513633 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4513634 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4513635 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4513636 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4513637 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4513638 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4513639 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4513640 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4513641 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4513642 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4513643 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4513644 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4513645 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4513646 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4513647 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4513648 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4513649 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4513650 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4513651 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion

4513659 great food is important because nobody can focus for fifteen hours on cold boxed lunches

4513664 well actually strap a heart rate monitor onto somebody and say go do your job for eight hours and then well come back and well follow the trace of their heart rate and we can say you know what this job requires exactly this level of fitness and this job requires exactly this oxygen consumption to be able to do it but we know how to prepare them for it and how to measure that theyre actually there
4513665 even the guys who do have sort of sedentary day to day jobs we dont evaluate only what they do in their daily job but what they could be called to do in an emergency
4513666 even your sailor who is sitting looking at a periscope all day or doing something like that if theres a fire on the ship hes a firefighter if theres a man overboard he has to rescue him as well
4513667 if this is not handled properly of course there could be an issue around retention
4513668 and thats why our goal is to develop this culture in which it just makes sense for people to want to stay to want to be fit and to want to improve themselves
4513669 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4513670 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

4513674 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4513675 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4513676 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4513677 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4513678 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4513679 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4513680 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned

4513684 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4513685 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4513686 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4513687 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4513688 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4513689 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4513690 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4513691 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4513692 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4513727 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year

4513763 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

4513831 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
4513832 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners

4513834 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
4513835 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby

4513887 moreover the cars engine actively cleans the air argonnes testing shows that the hydrogen 7s 12 cylinder engine actually shows emissions levels that for certain components are cleaner than the ambient air that comes into the cars engine
4513888 a gross polluter is easy to measure but the cleaner the car the harder it is to test
4513889 most labs test at the sulev level argonnes vehicle testing facilities are unique in that they are able to detect even trace levels of emissions in this case it was near zero emissions
4513890 argonnes advanced powertrain research facility was found to be the only public test facility in north america capable of testing hydrogen vehicles at these low emissions levels

4514439 despu s de esta firma todas las unidades rusas deben marcharse de georgia
4514440 la soberan a de georgia sobre abjasia y osetia del sur es inapelable
4514441 he pasado toda la noche en gori la ciudad est patrullada por las fuerzas de ocupaci n rusas la situaci n es de calma
4514442 los rusos prometieron que hoy permitir n el paso de ayuda humanitaria
4514443 si alguien contin a atacando a nuestros ciudadanos nuestras fuerzas de paz por supuesto responderemos justamente del mismo modo en que hemos respondido no debe haber ninguna duda al respecto
4514444 desafortunadamente despu s de lo que ha ocurrido es improbable que los osetios y los abjazos sean capaces de vivir en un estado junto con los georgianos
4514445 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4514446 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4514447 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4514448 in fact lesley wasnt even aware that skip had been arrested hayden found haydens dad is free

4514452 you must not lose faith in humanity humanity is an ocean if a few drops of the ocean are dirty the ocean does not become dirty
4514453 the difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the worlds problem
4514454 la differenza tra ci che facciamo e ci che siamo capaci di fare sarebbe sufficiente a risolvere la maggior parte dei problemi del mondo
4514455 you must be the change you want to see in the world
4514456 as human beings our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world that is the myth of the atomic age as in being able to remake ourselves
4514457 the weak can never forgive forgiveness is the attribute of the strong
4514458 an eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind
4514459 i claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal i own however that i have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps
4514460 i look only to the good qualities of men not being faultless myself i wont presume to probe into the faults of others
4514461 man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellow men
4514462 happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony
4514463 you know why a guns better than a wife you can put a silencer on a gun
4514464 the english club have presented us with an offer but we have rejected the chance to negotiate
4514465 mallorca is not interested in the departure of these players at this moment
4514466 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4514467 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4514468 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4514469 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4514470 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4514471 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4514472 managing the team thats my job and if i felt at any time that was in jeopardy then that is when i would consider it leaving
4514473 weve got a ground to play in right now its a great stadium and when the supporters are behind us its a great place
4514474 we do need a new one but if we havent got it well still have a team so thats not really too big an issue for us at the moment

4514478 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4514479 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq

4514499 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4514500 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4514501 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4514502 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population

4514513 growing influence of blogs on health news and policy debates
4514514 ive been a manager for nearly 20 years and in some respect ive had an easy life
4514515 in the past the vultures have never circled around me and put the pressure on thats the case now then i just have to deal with it
4514516 someone has to be the favourite to be first to go i looked on when i was a 40 1 outsider and wondered what its like
4514517 last year i think martin jol was in a fairly similar position
4514518 theres always someone maybe im doing the other 19 managers a favour at the moment
4514519 whats been said hasnt shaken my self belief because ive been at west ham 18 months stayed up and finished 10th even though we had many problems
4514520 like everyone im hoping for better things from this season i understand the criticism and take it on board
4514521 i dont just close my eyes to it but i dont have to accept all of it either
4514522 it seems a bit pre meditated in some respects but i just have to get on with it
4514523 the criticism is part and parcel of the game now the build up starts on thursday and doesnt die down until tuesday
4514524 everyones clamouring for a piece and all managers understand the pressure of the job
4514525 there wont be too many complaining because we know its part and parcel of what we do thats the way it is in the premier league now
4514526 i always seem to be defending myself and the team so id like not to have to do that i want everyone to give us a fair crack
4514527 theres no manager in the country who wants to be in a challenging position then fall away as if we do it on purpose
4514528 its amazing that people keep talking like that this reference to charlton is irritating because theyre a totally different set of circumstances
4514529 charlton came from nowhere and tried to establish themselves in the premier league they did that successfully
4514530 well ive heard everything is bigger in texas but i meant his other gold medal
4514531 bj hey you never know i use to say i liked girls too dont know what i was
4514532 wow the real superman he is hot especially when in the pool just a little pity that he loves girls
4514533 the many obstacles we needed to hurdle to get our deliveries accepted by the exchange
4514534 we have the chance to make history as the first team to claim olympic gold for brazil
4514535 tomorrow is an extremely important day it is the first final we know well have to run a lot and to seek to balance the match in the face of the rivals physical strength
4514536 we might get to 110 how quickly we get there would depend on the demand outlook
4514537 if next weeks u s inventory data shows an increase in stocks we could go lower
4514538 by putting up interceptors poland is placing itself at risk in terms of priority such targets are the first to be destroyed
4514539 the fairy tales that they are aimed at rogue states dont work anymore
4514540 because poland must be strong on its own and with its allies
4514541 we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement which is also good for the czech republic and nato
4514542 it would have happened even without the events in georgia
4514543 on the contrary looking into the future this system is an additional element of guaranteeing security
4514544 when i went to the film commission it was quite a sad organisation an organisation with low morale and now its definitely not that
4514545 the organisation has transformed its bigger got more resources has an excellent relationship with government and in the wake of lord of the rings its managed to create a holistic industry which is pretty connected through all levels
4514546 this week we cover a truck load of windows mobile news the 1src editorial foleo revisited and sprite terminator
4514547 i 25 will be closed for just a short period of time but its necessary to ensure a safe event for attendees

4514551 remember ladies no scratching no spitting no biting three two one swish
4514552 why not recycle its like passing good energy on not only are you saving the planet but you get a new wardrobe
4514553 swishing parties are particularly significant in the current economic climate why spend 100 on a new pair of shoes when you can come to a swishing party and get them for free and the best thing is you can have some glasses of wine nibbles and make new friends to like you love fashion
4514554 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4514555 michelle obama told 60 min she let barack run f prez only if he promised to quit smoking and she asked the country to notify her if we catch him this really is a new generation of leadership hillary clinton never wanted to know
4514556 eu tenho uma rela o pessoal com o presidente lula que s vezes incomodava alguns parceiros meus de partido e jamais deixei de t la uma rela o de amigo convivi com ele no congresso jamais deixei de ter com ele essa rela o antes dele ser presidente da rep blica antes de eu sequer pensar em ser governador do estado mas jamais deixei de fazer a minhas cr ticas pontuais acho que o governo gasta mal acho que o governo no campo da seguran a p blica poderia estar investindo mais
4514557 ao mesmo tempo eu reconhe o tamb m que por exemplo na rea econ mica o governo tem m rito tem virtudes eu n o acho que porque algu m de outro partido que s tenha defeitos e tampouco acho que por ser do meu partido s tenha virtudes eu acho que a liberdade que tenho com o presidente e a minha responsabilidade como governador de minas gerais me obriga a reconhecer os avan os as boas parcerias que tenho tido com o governo federal com as v rias reas mas tamb m me obriga de forma muito clara a dizer o que penso em rela o aos equ vocos do governo
4514558 eu acho que o governo federal n o assumiu na dimens o que deveria assumir as suas responsabilidades na quest o da seguran a p blica e cito apenas dois exemplos os recursos do fundo penitenci rio e do fundo nacional de seguran a t m sido constantemente contingenciados pelo governo federal eu acho que aquilo que aprovado pelo congresso nacional numa a o ou numa rea de tanta prioridade com a seguran a p blica n o deveria ser sujeito a qualquer tipo de contingenciamento
4514559 nasser 4 rockets that have a range of 25 kilometers and pose a threat to ashdod
4514560 the cease fire that was negotiated through egypt was very specific that the hamas movement and the other terrorist groups cant use it as a period to import more weapons more explosives more rockets into the gaza strip
4514561 mas bastou sa rem pesquisas mostrando geraldo alckmin na frente para que o ex presidente da rep blica se esquecesse de suas palavras
4514562 pessoas com responsabilidade p blica n o podem ficar toda hora comparecendo em campanha o serra vir quando ele quiser
4514563 estrategicamente me pareceu conveniente a alian a entre psdb e dem n o tendo havido condi o de formar essa alian a estou com o meu partido
4514564 bom que kassab se prepare porque muitos tucanos v o abrir o bico bater asas e voar n o creio que o governador jos serra ser desleal com o kassab nem com os democratas pois serra continua sendo leal mantendo se assim ser sem d vida presidente da rep blica com o apoio dos democratas
4514565 mais uma vez e s vou parar quando a m dia criar um
4514566 they have basically reduced a proud man to someone who doesnt want to hold his head up any more
4514567 theyve got someone who has been in charge of a police station for nine years who is in a position of trust
4514568 how can they treat someone in such a position of trust like a criminal more than you would treat criminals themselves
4514569 we are ever grateful from the bottom of our hearts
4514570 we really want to say how thankful we are to people who have come forward and offered us support
4514571 nearly every day someone is coming forward with a meal and flowers for us
4514572 foram muitos tiros e os policiais reagiram os criminosos fugiram para as matas que cercam as favelas encontramos rastros de sangue no caminho o que indica que algu m do bando foi ferido

4514580 we have a big job on our hands between now and this time in august and july next year
4514581 it is a tight finish but i think the state government and the council are used to working to
4514582 there is a lot of work to be done and we are now going from the conceptual design to the actual design being done
4514583 everything that we have in a conceptual design now has to go down to a detailed design to ensure that what we have here is a first class facility for the v8 supercars race
4514584 the consultants the government is working with are now working through that design phase and as soon as the council the state government and v8 supercars themselves are satisfied with that design phase we will be getting that work carried out as soon as we can
4514585 it will depend on the detailed engineering report that we get but certainly the track is enormously important
4514586 we are confident that we can complete the physical work by about easter next year because the track itself has to set for a three month period
4514587 the key aspects of course also include the bridge across the river and the pit building
4514588 i have no doubt having visited hamilton and looking at how they do it
4514589 they use temporary structures and we are putting in permanent structures but at the end of the day we are going to make sure we are ready for the race to occur
4514590 i can assure you we are ringing all bells and making sure we do our best in making sure this is a very successful first race in townsville
4514591 i am certainly sure that the sports mp judy spence will announce that shortly
4514592 we are keen to get it going as soon as we can but we need to get the design right to ensure that the construction can then go ahead
4514593 thank you and the big bump to go with it
4514594 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4514595 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4514596 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4514597 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4514598 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4514599 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4514600 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4514601 i knew i would i found you neala your safe now
4514602 i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous engraver
4514603 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon
4514604 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong playdate
4514605 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4514606 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4514607 i got some great clothes from alexander wang and i miss samantha ronson cuz shes out of town have a wonderful day everyone
4514608 two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was alcoholics anonymous she was into peace for a while
4514609 the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam
4514610 being married is not something thats even in our minds
4514611 whats important to me is to have a home that is peaceful and healthy
4514612 meditate and encourage people to stop blaming others to be more responsible for their own well being
4514613 i felt empowerment and rage and despondency even giddiness and self abuse i ran the gamut
4514614 all the hard work paid off all the injuries tears blood rips everything pays off at this very moment
4514615 everything just goes away you can only think of good things now
4514616 we came back and we showed the usa is really strong we deserved the top two medals and we showed the world we can come back no matter what
4514617 im still fighting for that medal count with him he has four so i have a few more to go
4514618 its an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him there on the floor exactly 20 years after he competed
4514619 i honestly didnt know until she finished and the scores came up
4514620 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
4514621 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
4514622 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
4514623 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
4514624 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
4514625 i know a few women who have come out here to do hairdressing but they left to go back to the coast because the pay was bad and theres not much to do
4514626 i think if they improved wages for those types of jobs it might help
4514627 theres definitely a lack of beautiful women blokes are not as picky you take what you can get
4514628 there are a small number of professionals like school teachers and nurses but its more of an open set up its difficult to find a girlfriend in this town and keep her
4514629 we made just 29 000 in comparison to 60 000 last year when we were able to sell full strength until 10pm
4514630 the bar is the main source of income for the event and the camel race is the main source of income for the town
4514631 last year we took 64 000 this year it was down to 42 000
4514632 were 150m away from a licensed pub so people just walk away and go to the pub
4514633 its disappointing everyone has been tarred with the same brush
4514634 people were just sitting around in their tents in groups and drinking instead of coming up to the bar and socialising
4514635 ours was a mid strength event and we had a far bigger crowd than last year and sold more alcohol
4514636 we provide entertainment people come here with their mates to be entertained and regardless of what drinks you serve they are going to have a drink
4514637 there are a lot of aspects to it other than what drinks you serve
4514638 i dont really subscribe to the theory that because the alcohol is mid strength that people will spend less
4514639 there has been some criticism from the organisers of some of these events but at the end of the day this was brought about by the behaviour of young people who for some reason or other cant behave on full strength
4514640 the mount isa district has a lot of assaults drink driving and fatal motor vehicle accidents and im responsible for the safety of people in the mount isa district
4514641 its all about trying to make events safe where people can have a good time without fear of being assaulted
4514642 bloomberg com iraq must act immediately against kurdish cuban says he will pull out all the stops in bid to buy cubs chicago tribune
4514643 simple cost shifting by the state to the counties for delivering state mandated services
4514644 the difference could spell property tax increases for new yorks overburdened homeowners and businesses
4514645 lets be clear here they are not cutting aid to counties they are cutting the reimbursements for programs that county governments are required by state statute to deliver we still have to spend taxpayer money to deliver the states programs the difference is that we just have less of the states funding to pay for it
4514646 if we are going to make the hard choices to address the current economic situation then we need to reduce state programs and services not simply shift more costs to property taxpayers
4514647 irish fest organizers thought trivia might be a nice addition to the irish fest line up they came to a trivia night this past spring at the tracks and were really surprised how many people have a great time with it
4514648 i really like to make it as interactive as possible we use maps quotes photos whatever we can to mix it up and incorporate all sectors of knowledge it is of course a competition but most people really come to have a beer and a good time with friends
4514649 and will be seeking meetings with both ministers to encourage their reconsideration given the size of our market and the current state of our industry now is the time to strengthen not abolish such key programs
4514650 now is the time for the federal government to recommit to its vitally important role in the cultural life of canada and reinforce its programs of direct and indirect investment thanks to federal partnership we have accomplished much in recent decades
4514651 and need to work together to build on our accomplishments and forge a more vibrant and competitive future for our sector
4514652 one area that many users were critical of was vmwares communication on the matter they were initially slow to issue public communications and proactively contact customers to let them know about the issue the thread in the vmware technology network vmtn forums that was started on this issue became the rallying point for many of the users who were experiencing problems as a result of the bug vmware employees did provide some updates to the thread which let users know they were aware of the bug but did not provide much other information until much later in the day another breakdown was that vmwares knowledgebase that had information on the bug and is often the first place users go to when experiencing a problem becamse so overwhelmed by the number of requests that it was unavailable for over 6 hours
4514653 virtualization after all is very much about putting all of ones eggs in one basket and if the basket has been woven by stoned hippies who have missed a few loops then enterprises are going to start thinking twice about something which is an already disconcerting concept
4514654 it all comes down to trust and theres a lot of us out here that just got hung out to dry doesnt matter whether paul maritz is sorry were sorry too
4514655 many of the comments on vmtn just break your spirit a bit until you harden yourself anger frustration are reasonable but anonymous posters and fan boys i have little patience or respect for you though i doubt you care strong feelings are good passion is good but dont hide if you feel strongly about your position and you think its reasonable
4514656 a military mastermind who takes part in hatching a plot to wipe out nazi leaders
4514657 yeah its true it is and i read the script its fantastic but im shooting at the very same time i wont be able to do it im doing a movie with judd apatow at the same time so thats not going to happen but i did read it it is awesome
4514658 the show had been looked at several times in the past for possible production
4514659 it just worked out this time due to the way we select our seasons that we needed a good drama to round things out
4514660 we had a strong presence at auditions and we actually had some decisions to make it allowed us to pick some outstanding actors and actresses
4514661 there are adult themes of death dying and unrequited love
4514662 to put it into movie terms it would be a pg 13
4514663 as far as the language goes we always clean that up
4514664 one of the biggest challenges was getting a cast on bricks leg
4514665 we ended up getting help from someone who works with orthopedic associates who made one for us that could be removed
4514666 also im in the cast and its hard to direct yourself
4514667 the extravagant demands of the flesh will no longer disturb you
4514668 when you lived in the world of corruptible things i revealed my power to you in visions now that you are passing from that life i will show myself to you face to face

4514680 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4514681 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4514682 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4514683 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4514684 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4514685 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4514686 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4514687 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4514688 a republican politician from idaho has endorsed barack obama the last time a republican switched sides was in an
4514689 democrats are furious theyre going on record now saying john edwards will not be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair yeah instead speaking in his place bill clinton you have to put your foot down
4514690 president bush spent the week in china watching the olympics all the while he was taunting former president bill clinton who was not in china by snapping and sending cell phone pictures of womens volleyball players
4514691 a lot of people have said a guy who cant use a computer is the wrong person for the white house last time i checked the president only needs to know how to press one button and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internet congressional quarterly reported this week that john mccain may have copied some facts in a recent speech on the georgian crisis from wikipedia i think it should have been obvious when he referred to the countrys leader as president 404 error file not found
4514692 if you vote for obama your penis is only as big as a tire gauge if you vote for mccain your penis is the size of a mighty oil rig
4514693 the department of homeland security decided to crack down hard on their application process to prevent those convicted of crimes from obtaining a government job
4514694 we would prefer no more reductions but we must keep expenses in line with revenue
4514695 if advertising and circulation revenues continue to decline further payroll reductions may be necessary
4514696 i think this is the most sober ive ever been leaving bowling
4514697 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4514698 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4514699 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
4514700 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4514701 he is a very good player i like him very much but so do all the other coaches in the world
4514702 exactly what is happening with him i dont know at the moment
4514703 it is not my business it is the business for the board to talk about money
4514704 he is a fantastic player who could play in any team in the world but i am happy with my players at chelsea if one or two more players arrive it will be better for us
4514705 we play 60 or 70 games a year so the door is always open for the players here and maybe one or two more in the future
4514706 barack obama plans an energy stimulus payment in his proposal that smells a whole lot like the economic stimulus payments
4514707 you know ive suspected something like this for a while
4514708 its fairly obvious who im voting for and it aint the guy who doesnt pay me to spam blogs all day
4514709 regarding his being a martian i have read nothing to support that but there are strong indications he was is a martian aka a memeber of the guild of intergalactic martians
4514710 i just ran the first 50 metres then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4514711 i have repeatedly won gold medals in the world championships but that was nothing for me
4514712 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4514713 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4514714 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4514715 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4514716 were obviously very excited to have ryan join our team
4514717 long before ryan came to nascar i knew he was talented his success in usac has continued in stock cars and to have someone of his caliber as my teammate makes both the driver part of me and the owner part of me very happy
4514718 all i want to do is win and tony is a proven winner as both a driver and a team owner
4514719 tony is a racer who has seen all sides of this sport he knows what it takes to win and i know that hes going to give me everything i need to be successful
4514720 we share the same goals the same background and the same mindset theres a comfort level at stewart haas racing thats very unique and its why ive made it my new home

4514729 yo creo que todas las miserias que nos rodean en el mundo son un tsunami que se est acercando y que va a devorarnos y con todo el derecho del mundo porque nuestro bienestar est basado y construido en su pobreza y en su explotaci n

4514733 es muy pobre la mentalidad de las personas que proyectan su miseria en aquellos que intentan ayudar como pueden es penoso y habla mucho de su propia forma de ver el mundo

4514740 apart from being one of our most important markets davao city also represents the future of it in the country
4514741 davao will always be a significant market for hp here in the philippines
4514742 we would want to help the local government of davao in strengthening the it infrastructure
4514743 by bringing in the widest it portfolio available today to the city we are already helping it anticipate and address all its needs as a major it hub

4514746 he has the experience and track record of building business through the reseller distribution channel and using new marketing techniques such as those in our fusion program allowing us to continue to achieve our growth goals
4514747 i am excited to be part of the rapidly growing bluestar team and am looking forward to developing bluestars hp business channel i see exciting opportunities ahead in so many areas of this market
4514748 we released two new tools and hp has released one to help administrators discover flaws so that they can mitigate attacks
4514749 we have seen a recent rise in the number of sql injection attacks
4514750 and we wanted to provide some tools and guidance to users so that they could deal with these attacks
4514751 urlscan can filter out all the known versions of the attacks weve seen this year
4514752 dont fool yourself if these attacks were only against say mysql they wouldnt be doing this
4514753 this sql injection attack trend really started when companies began looking at web 2 0 and decided that they had to have things like social networking and blogging on their sites
4514754 a lot of those features were added and didnt go through the normal checks for secure code that kind of tinkering leads to a loss of discipline
4514755 but when faced with the actual choices conservatives present they arent buying
4514756 the idea is for government to shape the choices people have so that the natural human tendency to avoid making a decision works to the individuals and societys advantage
4514757 well we want a strong social security we want to reduce the deficit we want health care for everyone
4514758 our troops have become the enemy we need to change direction in iraq
4514759 we designed imac to deliver the things consumers care about most the excitement of the internet and the simplicity of the mac
4514760 identifying and promoting best practice tools and methods in the field of online safety that also respect free expression
4514761 fosi has been a dedicated leader in promoting online safety and we look forward to contributing to the work they do
4514762 internet safety is a key priority for us as we strive to keep all teens safer online this new membership will further strengthen our efforts and will also allow us to share our expertise with other members
4514763 a few weeks ago we got first word of nasas plan to
4514764 we cant have residents unilaterally put down their own speed bumps because that would create chaos for us across the city
4514765 he has run amtrak like a true champion in my judgment
4514766 computacenters revenue mix is the other way around and we are on budget to produce more profit than it in 2009 on less than 10 per cent of its revenues
4514767 the players are professionals and there is no doubt they are hurt by what happened at macclesfield
4514768 i see jimmy in training every day and i see him working very hard at his game i see him very focused and committed to the team so these things dont really tie up
4514769 i havent had any conversations with him since alistair macintosh made it clear that we dont want to be discussing at the moment new contracts for players who have at least two years left on their current ones
4514770 we would rather concentrate on improving our squad and seeing how that improvement pans out then maybe as the contracts go further into their term there will be time for readjustment
4514771 i dont really understand the arguments because if people are trying to suggest jimmy bullard is unhappy then that is not the case
4514772 he is getting on with his work professionally he perhaps didnt get what he wanted to make him the happiest person but im sure he fully understands the situation
4514773 he is not a player we would want to lose at all but we have to be realistic about things
4514774 i am looking forward to this game we got beat at home to plymouth three seasons ago so it will be a good opportunity to put that straight
4514775 it was my first professional english game and i only started because of injuries to other players we got beat which wasnt nice but it was a great experience and i was happy with the way it went apart from losing
4514776 even if we had won that game no one could have imagined what was going to happen
4514777 i was sure that i would feature in upcoming crucial games after overcoming the injury worries before our first match
4514778 then it was like hell for me because when i tried to sprint i felt a sharp pain in my kneecap
4514779 it looks as if hes got a slight strain in his calf he obviously looks quite doubtful for the weekend
4514780 ryans trained with the second group this week but i didnt risk him for that behind closed doors practice game adam was terrific on tuesday
4514781 if we want to go out and play like we did in the first half at luton im not going to come out and watch the game
4514782 if we give reading chances like we did to luton i can assure you they are the type of team who will plunder you
4514783 there were so many fouls in the game in training yesterday that if i had stopped play every time we would never have finished it they would have been taking free kicks all day
4514784 the annoying thing for me is people are starting to appreciate they have got to stick their foot in now rather than later
4514785 its terrible to say it but maybe the defeat at luton will be a benefit
4514786 its nice to be in the second round and it gives a good feeling to see that we won away from home
4514787 combined with the positive reaction that we have had so far from our performances i hope that will set us up for the game this weekend
4514788 a lot of people are probably looking at this game to see where we are

4514796 every microsoft offering we take to market will have a services aspect for instance when the new version of sql server comes out resellers will be given a services option if they do not have it in house
4514797 what bell is doing supports our goal for this year of driving the category element of our portfolio it will allow resellers to bring additional resources into their business if they lack the skill or if their engineers are deployed elsewhere
4514798 honestly if its going to happen its going to happen and there is nothing you can do about it
4514799 if its going to happen its just going to happen thing

4514801 just about every game thats come out on a sega console in the past and present as well as a ton of extremely rare or strange peripherals
4514802 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other
4514803 when it comes to points it becomes a bit different
4514804 it is like when you go to church on a sunday the priest says everyone has to be respectful and generous but when you come out of the church everyone is not generous and respectful
4514805 we are prepared to do whatever it takes to win a football game but within the respect of the game
4514806 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football
4514807 the beauty in the game is to win within the respect of the rules but we will do whatever it takes to win a football game
4514808 i found him to be very impressive i found him to be a very thoughtful person
4514809 he got off to a very good start with me
4514810 absolutely he is conservative but i believe in the broad mainstream of american jurisprudence
4514811 it is healthy to have different views on the court
4514812 guaranteed to succeed with my system that does 98 99 of the work for you
4514813 ive known him for many years and obviously i know what kind of hockey he likes
4514814 he definitely likes offensive hockey and thats what i like too
4514815 we are very close friends and i always like to play hockey for a guy like that
4514816 my family is very happy that we can join the canucks and enjoy the city and everything around it

4514824 saiful is under police protection and they have a hold on him and they decide what he should or should not do
4514825 no it wasnt a possibility we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state
4514826 our goal was to remain here in pittsburgh those trips to kansas city and las vegas and other cities were just to go have a nice dinner and come back
4514827 we had a lot of support from our fans which was the key for us
4514828 the fans showed that they wanted to keep this team here in pittsburgh forever and thats one of the reasons were standing here today

4514858 for this is the will of god your sanctification that you abstain from sexual immorality that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor not in the passion of lust like the gentiles who do not know god that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter
4514859 lets not be so hard on these poor strugglers isnt christianity based on grace the power of the holy spirit is far more powerful than our flesh even if we sin with our bodies the spirit will prevail in our lives according to gods grace we just have to let go and let god we have to just trust in god and his goodness after all god wants only the best for us and would never allow one of his children to fall lets not diminish the powerful grace of god by making a big deal of this
4514860 but i have this against you that you tolerate that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols i gave her time to repent but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality behold i will throw her onto a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her i will throw into great tribulation unless they repent of her works and i will strike her children dead and all the churches will know that i am he who searches mind and heart and i will give to each of you as your works deserve

4514871 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4514872 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4514873 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4514874 im going to refer you to loma linda university gi a big time childrens hospital near us because its not normal for a baby to vomit like that

4514876 its my opinion that nissan made a huge error by igniting these racist instincts
4514877 we need to apply punishments against these things in order for nissan to keep its interests in the region it must apologize

4514879 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4514880 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4514881 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4514882 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4514883 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4514884 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4514885 who are open to doing something on the production side
4514886 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4514887 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4514888 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4514889 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4514890 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4514891 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4514892 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4514893 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4514894 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4514895 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4514896 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4514897 the most immediate application for brain machine interfaces is in medicine
4514898 games like lazybrains can help kids who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd learn how to concentrate in a fun and friendly environment and as the underlying technology behind lazybrains matures they may become as easy to use as a wii controller
4514899 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
4514900 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
4514901 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign
4514902 how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad
4514903 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
4514904 over 3 billion page views 15 million unique users and over 60 million video streams
4514905 people are starting to see oh we have these different industries that are collecting the same types of information to profile individuals and the devices they use on the network
4514906 internet cellphones cable any way you tap into the network concerns are raised
4514907 a broad approach to protecting peoples online privacy seems both desirable and inevitable
4514908 advertisers and data collectors who record where customers go and what they do want profit at the expense of privacy
4514909 jeg havde to gode r i werder mens jeg har v ret v k er der sket en positiv udvikling og klubben er nu en af de bedste i europa jeg kan hj lpe klubben med min internationale erfaring og gl der mig over mit nye hold
4514910 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4514911 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4514912 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4514913 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4514914 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4514915 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4514916 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4514917 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4514918 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4514919 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4514920 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4514921 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4514922 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
4514923 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
4514924 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
4514925 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
4514926 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
4514927 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
4514928 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
4514929 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
4514930 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it
4514931 they were sick and we told god and god said their time has come
4514932 i see nothing funny in what i read to you
4514933 but if you do then you should enjoy reading this book yourselves now being as its friday youll have all weekend to take your copy home and pickup with the golden thread chapters 5 through 13 and bring me a report on monday of how you perceive the symbolism between the theme and narrative of those chapters it must be typed double spaced and no less than 1000 words
4514934 what kind of a sick o does that in class
4514935 yeah really i mean at least it entertains us and keeps us awake through all that boring marquis this and monsignor that dickens crap
4514936 look at all this homework we got now because of him shit man i had plans this weekend and it didnt include no freakin reading and homework and shit
4514937 its probably just a habit he may not even realize hes doing it maybe you should cut him a break
4514938 you think so well cut this a break little girl
4514939 she needs to take off her rose colored glasses and get herself laid
4514940 shell have to take off more than her glasses to get laid
4514941 if you ask me she and carl need to get together and get it out of their system
4514942 tam kinda had a point about it not being carls fault altogether i mean about the homework thing
4514943 mrs w wouldnt have even known what was goin on if it hadnt been for whoever lost it in there and cackled so damn loud
4514944 because hello its always the one that acts all innocent and stuff thats usually the most guilty id bet she sits in there every afternoon watching and waiting to see if carl is going to do himself and when he does she probably cant wait to run to the little girls room after class so she can die laughing at him only today she couldnt wait that long so she busted out loud
4514945 she did try to convince us it was just a bad habit of his and we shouldnt say anything sounds like shes trying to keep carl from realizing it about himself so the show will go on maybe she likes the show
4514946 i cant imagine that being any kind of a habit habit forming yes habitual maybe but a habit you dont realize you have cut me a break i mean i could see habits like picking your nose or even scratching your balls without realizing it but i dont think masturbation falls into the unknown habit category
4514947 youd have to be in a freakin coma or something not to know what your boys down there thinkin and feelin
4514948 thats it i think you hit the nail on the head cotton
4514949 come on weve all noticed how crazy faced carl gets when hes uh you know shakin things up
4514950 so he looks like hes sort of comatose but with his eyes open like hes havin some kind of out of body experience
4514951 so youre sayin he really doesnt know what hes doin when hes doin it like hes in a trance or something
4514952 he cant just walk around in a trance all the time something has to trigger it what is it that triggers him into doing it
4514953 if nothing is triggering him into a trance then it cant be a trance
4514954 are you saying then that it is more like a habit
4514955 no i dont think the actual physical part of it is habit but whatever goes through his mind that gets him ready for the physical part is the habit
4514956 huh you mean thinking dirty thoughts can become a habit
4514957 at least publicly it all begins in our brain you can choose to have good thoughts over bad thoughts you can think good things and develop good behavior and skills from those good thoughts like a baseball player that sees himself hitting homeruns begins to transfer those thoughts to his batting arm he develops a better grip and swing on the bat and next thing you know hes a star player but if all he ever allows himself to think about is his own physical pleasure in a sexual way then hes nothing but a porn star you see what im saying here
4514958 on the one hand we can choose to be a baseball player or on the other we can be a porn star
4514959 i get it its like this cigarette i smoke because im addicted to them i crave them sometimes but i cant always satisfy that craving because im sitting in class or at moms dinner table or someplace where i cant smoke so i have to occupy my cravings with other things like gum or drink a coke or something i make a conscious effort to keep my habit at bay because i know up here
4514960 that it isnt the time or place for me to smoke one
4514961 and it isnt exactly like youre in a trance when you smoke one because you make a conscious choice to smoke one
4514962 but even though he makes that conscious choice its still triggered by his need for nicotine which could be considered a trance inducing drug
4514963 because dont smokers believe that having a cigarette calms them down during stressful situations or helps relieve tension some smokers seemingly become more reasonable to talk to or say they can think better after theyve had a cigarette if thats the case then it induces a mild trancelike state of mind
4514964 so whats that have to do with having a dirty mind to my knowledge carl doesnt smoke so what brings on his trancelike state
4514965 his focus is on what hes thinking if his mind is in the gutter his thoughts may become so strong that he mentally closes himself off from reality and temporarily forgets that hes sitting there performing a very private act in a very public place
4514966 so he trances himself with his own mind through the use of pornographic images interesting
4514967 from now on please use the restroom before you come to class that little pee pee dance you do in your seat is quite distracting for the other students and myself
4514968 life does not need to mutilate itself in order to be pure
4514969 erudite and impassioned an act of faith and of resistance to the insidious claims of the post christian and post liberal state
4514970 my friend and i were coming down the stairs of the lighting booth to go talk to our teacher who was at the other end of the building
4514971 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4514972 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4514973 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4514974 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4514975 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
4514976 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
4514977 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
4514978 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
4514979 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
4514980 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
4514981 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
4514982 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
4514983 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
4514984 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
4514985 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
4514986 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
4514987 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
4514988 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
4514989 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
4514990 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
4514991 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
4514992 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
4514993 bowing is a very serious practice you should be prepared to bow even in your last moment even though it is impossible to get rid of our self centered desires we have to do it our true nature wants us to
4514994 he is one of the great american leaders whose support of the jewish state is inviolable
4514995 it would be very problematic for israel to give up the west bank from their own standpoint of security the same thing with the golan heights giving up the golan heights makes most of the galilee a sitting target
4514996 i think hes a great man and if john mccain as president picked him to be secretary of state or some other cabinet position i dont think anyone has a problem with that but i dont know that he would be a good fit to be vice president
4514997 hamas wants us dead they will kill us if we return and israel is not letting us in
4514998 if that happens abu mazen abbas bears responsibility for our deaths
4514999 this king loves jews therefore he asked the jews living in bahrain to request jews living in israel to return there are two reasons for it one is lip service or to emphasize his love to the jews there
4515000 i want to tell you there are very few jews in bahrain they all work as traders they are obligated to the king and in the parliament this wise king chose from every group representatives in the parliament even the jews who are a small minority
4515001 the jews felt hostility they were victims of looting including my house in bahrain the majority are shia muslims which were behind most of the looting thats when i decided to come to israel
4515002 they refused they have a lot of money businesses i gave up
4515003 but i think that the people of the parliament dont like the idea that a jew is there and see her as a spy the king who loves the jews promoted her to be an ambassador
4515004 bahrain has reached out for hundreds of years we have got at least 30 churches in a very small country and mosques next to churches and synagogues next to churches they are all living there and i think this is the real arab neighborhood
4515005 if the ceasefire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4515006 we know you are planning to assassinate leaders of the resistance but you do not frighten us
4515007 israel exported failed generals in order to train the georgian armed forces
4515008 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed
4515009 mrs tucker at 12 00 sharp you have to leave your house
4515010 we join the confederaction asociaciones israelitas de venezuela caiv in their denunciation of the raid as an unjustifiable act against the venezuelan jewish community we join them in their call to investigate these acts which create unnecessary tensions between venezuelan jews and the venezuelan government
4515011 troubling that anti semitism continues to be used as a political tool in your country
4515012 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4515013 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4515014 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4515015 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4515016 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4515017 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4515018 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4515019 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4515020 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4515021 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4515022 im glad it didnt end up with either of our blood in the others hands
4515023 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4515024 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4515025 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4515026 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4515027 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4515028 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4515029 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4515030 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4515031 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4515032 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4515033 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4515034 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4515035 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4515036 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4515037 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4515038 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4515039 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4515040 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4515041 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4515042 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4515043 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4515044 rewriting system rom for new settings please do not turn off or reboot your machine
4515045 for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous
4515046 force is always on the side of the governed the governors have nothing to support them but opinion tis therefore on opinion only that government is founded and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments as well as to the most free and most popular
4515047 to protect the minority of the opulent from the majority
4515048 when i see multitudes of entirely naked savages scorn european voluptuousness and endure hunger fire the sword and death to preserve only their independence i feel that it does not behoove slaves to reason about freedom
4515049 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4515050 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4515051 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4515052 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4515053 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4515054 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4515055 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4515056 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4515057 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4515058 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4515059 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4515060 forth is greater than either a tentative first step or a mechanical consolidation by a band on the gravy train it may not be as smooth a mix as the bands classic album a northern soul yet the mix of ashcrofts balladeering and the verves more experimental instincts compares well with urban hymns while sit and wonder alone justifies a second reunion but forth is also so much more this album is probably the most solid foundation this quartet have had in 15 years and it would be a disaster if it wasnt a springboard for several more farewells might be sudden with the verve but we dont want to hear the next goodbye for at least well is five years asking too much
4515061 che significa sentire la mancanza di una persona a cui vuoi bene
4515062 i really like the flow of the course i feel like theres a lot of different type of shots
4515063 in the last couple years especially around this time of year the course up at christiansburg has four or five groups lined up at the tees
4515064 it takes a little while to play and you got to be willing to wait
4515065 the average person probably carries about five discs and some people just bring one
4515066 if you buy five discs youll have 50 invested in the whole sport
4515067 i really like the flow of the course i feel like theres a lot of different type of shots
4515068 you want them to enjoy what theyre playing and say wow i want to come back
4515069 they really enjoy playing but they have a hard time at christiansburg
4515070 mom we want to do this next time we walk
4515071 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4515072 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4515073 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4515074 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4515075 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4515076 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4515077 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4515078 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4515079 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4515080 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4515081 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4515082 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

4515084 i don t think that you are pretty i find you fair and beautiful
4515085 american capitalism represents more than just an universities and colleges publishing houses mass circulation magazines newspapers television and radio stations professional sports teams foundations churches private museums charity organizations and hospitals are organized as corporations ruled by boards of trustees or directors or regents composed overwhelmingly of affluent businesspeople these boards exercise final judgment over all institutional matters
4515086 should we have ever been there or be there now
4515087 if we leave now will everything good thats happened there as a result of our presence fall apart
4515088 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4515089 its a pity that when we are still faced with a most complicated situation to work on the united states is further aggravating the situation in relations with russia
4515090 russia is strong and russia has to be reckoned with
4515091 i love 50s they come to me automatically in the 100 i really have to think about what i am doing but in the 50 i just go for it
4515092 i am a mystery at the moment even to myself
4515093 i never know what i am going to do until i turn around at the end and see the scoreboard
4515094 shes very impressive i am not going to be swimming when i am 40
4515095 hopefully i will be married with kids and they wont be swimming either
4515096 i want to see now how they will conduct themselves in their homes
4515097 si ese chico se lo toma todo al pie de la letra no llegar muy lejos en la vida
4515098 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4515099 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4515100 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4515101 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4515102 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4515103 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but the strategic potential of russia
4515104 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values
4515105 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere
4515106 i dont want to be in a serious relationship with you
4515107 its not the will to win but the will to prepare to win that makes the difference
4515108 the price of victory is high but so are the rewards
4515109 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4515110 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

4515112 cuando kirchner habl en las puertas del congreso us un lenguaje que
4515113 no fue un exabrupto duhalde sabe bien lo que est transmitiendo ya que a nadie se le escapa que este se or no se caracteriza por su ingenuidad
4515114 duhalde pacific al pa s lo normaliz y dio las reglas de juego para que los productores puedan exportar y vender
4515115 kirchner cometi un error hist rico al poner una persona sin experiencia en la presidencia
4515116 i feel like crying when i see my friends going to school
4515117 my job is to collect the empty plastic water bottles that people dump on the ground and sell them to a bottle buyer in our town sometimes i make about 3 500 kyat us 3 per day
4515118 now i can afford to send my little sister to school and at the same time provide enough income so my mother has no serious financial worries my mother has re opened her road side noodles shop but earns just us 1 per day
4515119 we cant think of rebuilding our house yet because money for food and for school is a first priority my mother always told me she wanted me to go to school but couldnt afford the school fees for both my sister and me
4515120 i feel like crying when i see my friends going to school but i have to console myself its my destiny there are a lot of us who cant go to school because we have to help our parents
4515121 my mother said no to my going to yangon to look for work as a housemaid because she was afraid i would be sexually assaulted or trafficked into the sex industry im also afraid of being sold or raped but my mother told me i cannot go there i have to listen to my mothers orders
4515122 californians are paying over 4 50 per gallon for gasoline and deserve a representative who will work to end our nations dependence on oil and fight for alternative energy sources
4515123 andal has consistently voted against fuel efficiency programs and measures to slow global warming his current proposals echo the failed policies of the bush administration that created the situation were in now if elected andal will help the oil industry dismantle the laws that protect californias coastline from oil spills from tankers and offshore drilling while doing nothing to reduce the price of gasoline
4515124 this year californians have a clear choice between a proven leader who has spent his life working to find alternative energy sources and a developer who has habitually opposed clean energy
4515125 hints of scandal and one of the worst voting records on energy in california dean andals doing the pombo mambo
4515126 the national forests of southern california support a globally significant concentration of wildlife and plants and are a popular destination for millions of people seeking relief from the concrete jungle
4515127 yet the forest service ignores these values and treats most of this land as if it were worthy only of development for urban infrastructure or other exploitation
4515128 instead of managing these forests for the public who actually own and use this land the bush administration plans to axe protections for pristine and scenic landscapes sacrificing important wildlife habitat for the benefit of a few corporations
4515129 its sad that this administration continues to think that making big corporations rich is its first responsibility
4515130 the forest service missed an important opportunity to improve the ecological health of southern californias forest ecosystems
4515131 opening up the most pristine areas to off road vehicles and resource exploitation without considering essential habitats and the species that depend on them is a clear violation of federal environmental law
4515132 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4515133 tibet supporters took action at cctv today to broadcast a message of truth about the intensifying military crackdown in tibet and the tibetan peoples undying resolve to regain their freedom
4515134 digital government information is considered at risk with an estimated life span of 44 days for a web site this collection will provide an historical record of value to the american people
4515135 lisaraye is nothing more than a gold digger she wants a cash settlement upwards of several million dollars
4515136 thats what she should be doing she deserves spousal support she hasnt been going on auditions and things so she devoted her time to him and hasnt been working as much its not like shes coming in like rocsi just being on bet
4515137 ghana cant afford to build a gold mine inside one of our last remaining forest reserves
4515138 many threatened species occur in the reserve the forests are also important for communities and livelihoods and for the areas water supply
4515139 large scale gold mining in this ecologically fragile forest reserve could also undermine food security in the area
4515140 my landlord has told me to vacate the house because i indicated to him that there was no way i could raise the foreign currency to buy the fuel coupons houses to rent are difficult to get these days and that means that my four children wife and i might end up living in the open if we fail to secure alternative lodgings
4515141 as it is i am struggling to keep the children in school we barely have enough food and i need to settle a huge bill after my wife stayed for two weeks in hospital where she was operated on for breast cancer god knows where on earth i would raise that kind of money
4515142 we have seen many property owners arrested for charging rent in foreign currency but there is no law that i am aware of that stipulates that a landlord cannot ask for fuel coupons so that way we are able to dodge the law while at the same time getting our rent in a form that enables us to keep our money stable
4515143 because that would leave me with the burden of having to go out onto the streets to sell it again
4515144 fuel coupons are now firmly a form of currency in a country whose people will stop at nothing to ensure that they are protected against a hyperinflationary environment
4515145 like foreign currency the value of the coupons does not change even if kept for a long time and that way service providers realise that they are able keep their money in a stable form
4515146 in other words coupons are a replacement for foreign currency and insistence on their usage by those who offer services or sell products amply indicates the level to which our economy has dollarised
4515147 clever type of barter trade now the norm countrywide in an economy where the local currency is not worth much
4515148 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
4515149 on connaissait les moutons gorg s dans la montagne par des loups
4515150 the total amount of water used annually is 3 5 billion cubic metres cu m of which 93 percent is used in agriculture 6 percent in households and 1 percent by industry the renewed fresh water is 2 5 billion cu m per year the gap between used water and renewed fresh water is 1 billion cu m a year
4515151 about 92 percent of yemens land is arid semi arid and desert
4515152 before 1970 there were no wells 800 metres deep they were manually dug and their depth was only 20 40 metres
4515153 influential figures are digging wells in sanaa city with the ministry of water unable to do anything to stop them the water law is not being implemented
4515154 in 1974 the area irrigated by ground water was 30 000 35 000 hectares but now over 400 000 hectares is irrigated by ground water at that time yemen produced 1 2 million tonnes of cereals but now production has dropped sharply as agriculture is not fed by rain
4515155 very few were built adequately dams are not looked after and most of them have been filled with filth us 22 billion was spent on dams but their capacity is only 80 million cubic metres mcm yemen is a poor country but its resources are wasted
4515156 some are too old to be used these studies were also not accessible to researchers
4515157 we must create public awareness on the problem of water which everybody should understand
4515158 in the sanaa basin 250 mcm of water is used per year but it is fed by 60 mcm a year so there is a shortage as well as acute diminution of sanaa basins water in a few years people will be using only the renewed water rainwater 60 mcm
4515159 how do we want to benefit from desalinating sea water when it will immediately be used to irrigate qat
4515160 the government pays us 3 billion a year for such subsidies diesel represents 80 percent of qat cultivation costs if the subsidies were lifted then no farmer would be able to cultivate qat
4515161 the medfly is a pest that poses a serious threat to california agriculture
4515162 i would like to thank the residents and growers who helped us eradicate these infestations by cooperating with the three quarantines
4515163 unfortunately they just lifted the call and ab 1806 failed passage on a vote of 18 21
4515164 reconsideration was granted but it does not look like we will be able to get the votes to get the bill off the senate floor
4515165 we tried to lobby the members to get the last few votes but unfortunately the fact that the bill went on call gave the opposition more time to lobby members to move into the no column
4515166 this bill was to be the beginning of the delta fishery restoration process and would have provided funds for the states impacted salmon fishery its defeat is a slap in the face to californias commercial and recreational anglers
4515167 we were counting on this bill as a funding mechanism for hundreds of projects needed to recover salmon
4515168 in spite of our successful efforts to move the bill through the assembly and two senate committees in the end we were outgunned by the intense lobbying of the water contractors and the administration the bill is dead for this year
4515169 do we give up absolutely not we come back next year better organized and with all the additional grassroots firepower we can muster we wont give up until we get the funding for mitigation and fish recovery if you are as mad as we are take the action that will help the most get everyone you know to sign onto water4fish org click and send letters to the politicians and give us the powerful proxy ammunition we can use
4515170 the death of tens of thousands of fish including striped bass and other sportfish could have been prevented with some basic planning
4515171 this bill is a strong first step towards preventing further losses to our states fisheries
4515172 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4515173 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4515174 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4515175 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4515176 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4515177 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4515178 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4515179 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

4515183 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4515184 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4515185 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4515186 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4515187 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4515188 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4515189 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4515190 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4515191 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

4515198 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4515201 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4515206 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4515207 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4515208 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4515209 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4515210 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4515211 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4515212 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4515213 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4515214 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4515215 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4515216 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4515217 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4515218 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4515219 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4515220 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4515221 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4515222 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4515223 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4515224 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4515225 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4515226 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4515227 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4515228 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4515229 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4515230 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4515231 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4515232 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4515233 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4515234 cant believe i shaved for this i mean what am i even doing here who cares about bob saget
4515235 i dont know you know i guess a few other people turned it down its always how i look at it
4515236 in which 100 comics riffed on the worlds dirtiest joke that revealed his notoriously filthy sense of humor
4515237 no i really like her shes a really good girlfriend
4515238 you should try that i think thatd be good for you
4515239 and maybe danny gets caught in the kitchen with a pie ap or maybe you could play danny again saget i dont know unless i can play him intoxicated which i dont think theyll go for americas funniest home videos
4515240 btid allows a vehicle to identify another friend if the friend has a btid on board or as an unknown if the vehicle does not have a btid
4515241 essentially what this offers is a quick means for a soldier to quickly talk to his coalition partner should the need arise in the tactical scenario
4515242 should there be anything in its cone of fire the machine gun operator will have a friendly in sector alert
4515243 he gets a blue visual indication if its a friendly and nothing if its clear
4515244 there was a marine joint terminal air controller on the ground with a btid interrogator scanning his target area getting similar responses from any friendly forces that were equipped with btid transponders
4515245 this enabled him to send that friendly force information directly to the cockpit of a strike aircrew that was another application of btid done for the first time in eglin
4515246 whats important here is that the fundamental military utility of btid has been assessed over the past few years but what bold quest plus did is add to the assessment with new applications of the same technology being tested
4515247 you had the canadians doing what maj groh just described the u s marines doing what i just described and all of these other things enhanced the analysis from previous assessments this was not a re do of previous testing
4515248 the biggest thing for us is that we are a much smaller force and what we get to do is work with other forces to develop a capability that is immediately able to be integrated with coalition partners
4515249 if we did this alone it would not work out wed bring something to the battlefield but it might not necessarily work with others here for everybody its a low cost way to make sure these things are integrated for when they come into operations
4515250 from our point of view we obviously collected a lot of information there pretty confident that having collected that much were going to in a few months have some analysis thats of value in both adding to the assessment of these technologies as well as pointing a way forward so i think it was well worth our time and money and effort to do what we did

4515334 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4515335 thrown into confusion and anarchy as a result of a chieftancy tussle between the sitting chief and a disgruntled chief in view of the arrival of daewoo company
4515336 the situation could have escalated to uncontrollable level if not for the quick intervention of the men of the jtf who professionaly restored normalcy and order
4515337 the struggle for now does not exist because a struggle is ideological and there is no ideological bent to the struggle we are seeing
4515338 the first thing to say is that in baghad you know what the war is about dont you it is a religious war between the shiites and the sunnis in rivers state in bayelsa and other parts of the niger delta who is fighting who what is the war about what is the shooting about the kidnap cases that are taking place are against whom when you came into port harcourt you saw it as a graveyard this is not the old port harcourt that we use to have there are three principal economic centres in nigeria lagos abuja and port harcourt we are by ourselves killing our own economic centre in the comity of nations we cannot compete as we should because the nerve centre of our economic activities is beginning to disappear at the same time lagos is beginning to become the hub of oil activities in nigeria because we are on our asking lagos to assume the position of being the oil capital of nigeria and we call it militancy and i call it criminality
4515339 the first aspect of my speech is what most of are here gathered is this country fair to niger delta people have we been fairly treated as we look at the laws i have some of the law that i have indicated them
4515340 the same laws there is another law that is called the exclusive economic zone act it is structured in the same way for which you have to get licenses to be able to exploit natural resources including oil
4515341 let me take you to the most important aspect to me
4515342 the first thing to say is that in baghad you know what the war is about dont you it is a religious war between the shiites and the sunnis
4515343 the way to define criminality is that anybody who breaks the laws of the federal republic of nigeria is a criminal
4515344 the struggle for now because it does not exist because a struggle is ideological and there is no ideological bent to the struggle we are seeing
4515345 we ask ourselves one basic question what are we voted here to do what is our responsibility
4515346 but the truth is that when it militancy started nobody thought it will get to this point
4515347 we must demand from our leaders accountability they must account not for the funds alone they must account for what they have turned our children into they must tell us why the next mans life is not as important as their own life they must when they started it it was just simple local government area matter chairman of council that they were struggling for and to publicly say that we have won an election today those local governments are not even in their hands anymore today they cannot go home today governors are demanding for more security in their convoys today legislators are demanding for more security from their governors today commissioners are demanding for security
4515348 when i was a speaker before i became governor i used to see some of them they tell me these are the people who are into this shooting and when they come they carry young girls they wear these jeans half of their buttocks and they come with jeeps and imagine if n250 000 can buy them jeeps
4515349 then we the governors at that point we have a responsibility
4515350 as a governor i have plans of what i want to do but as i am talking to you i cannot execute those things because i have security threats

4515367 and as a matter of fact in this years budget i think about 1 billion has been set aside on short term basis to put infrastructure to stop gas flaring
4515368 we want to take a different approach this time around to end gas flaring and before the end of this year that in the next few months when they have brought the plan and everything we need to do then i will announce it but gas flaring must stop
4515369 there is no infrastructure in place because you have to put infrastructure in place and harness the gas and transform the gas to power the plants
4515370 by the end of next year we assure the nation i am saying categorically we should be able to generate 6000 megawatts of electricity through the supply of gas
4515371 the national assembly should accelerate the consideration of the bills to amend the police and prisons acts
4515372 there should be an immediate provision and upgrading of facilities in prisons and other detention centres and expansion of legal aid and access to justice programmes and
4515373 if we play like this in the next game we are dead and out
4515374 i think that their attitude is a big problem and thats why they are not playing as one good unit
4515375 the other day he made us go late to training his attitude has been terrible the bad thing is that victor anichebe appears to be emulating him he was on phone while in the dressing room and he knows it is something he cannot do in his club at everton
4515376 since this is a government that believes in the rule of law and due process and since all the three tiers of government have agreed to use part of their share of the excess crude account the federal government and states have to go to their various lawmakers to appropriate the amount before it would be released
4515377 to ensure that the impact of government in this regard is felt in no distant time the chief executives of the zonal distribution companies were given six weeks to complete the installation of the transformers and materials
4515378 the former commission during its 48th ordinary meeting of 16th november 2006 following submission from appointment and promotion committee deliberated on the special promotion and rejected the recommendation
4515379 the acting secretary conveyed the decision of the commission to the igp
4515380 the request by the commission to get copy of the memo of mr presidents approval was not submitted to the commission
4515381 the actions of the former igp were illegal unconstitutional null and void and of no legal effect and the commission has the constitutional mandate to revert the promotion because the officer who granted the promotion has no authority or constitutional mandate
4515382 the reference to mr president is only a cover up to justify the illegal action taken by the former igp as the provision of the constitution precludes the police council from taking any action that is purview to the police service commission
4515383 the problem we have here today is because the former inspector general of police mr sunday ehindero took action in total disregard of police service commission act and the constitution of federal republic of nigeria
4515384 quite a number of the officers promoted are far junior and are unqualified for the new ranks arising from this i wrote to the igp to provide data of all the officers involved the danger involved with the promotion is that if the affected officers retire today the commission will not compute their gratuity based on the illegal ranks it will be on the former ranks
4515385 section 6 2 of police service commission states clearly that the commission shall not be subject to direction control or supervision of any other authority other than the commission even if it was mr president who did it we will reverse it nobody is gunning at anybody we want to put the police in civilised footing
4515386 i am going to be blunt the chairman should have asked you if ribadu will be recalled from nipss
4515387 i will not be part of it i am a retired dig just as the chairman osayande and we know that the police follows procedures if ribadu had become igp over 2 000 police officers would have retired prematurely and that would have been a national disaster
4515388 the premier and the government are now looking at how to respond to climate change but they dont recognise the scale of the problem or the scale and urgency of the response that is needed
4515389 how can you tell people climate change is important and then say were going to have this new black coal equivalent power station and were going to put lots of money into it

4515399 barack is a strong man of christian faith who has been married to his wife michelle for 16 years pastor kirbyjon caldwell says in the tv ad
4515400 and he is the proud father of two beautiful daughters adds pastor suzette caldwell
4515401 throughout his entire career sen obama has stood by families caldwell says
4515402 these smears on john mccains character and faith expose the utter hypocrisy of barack obamas claim to represent a new kind of politics brian rogers a spokesman for the mccain campaign said today
4515403 its disgraceful the american people know that john mccains faith and character were tested and forged in ways few can fathom
4515404 there is a huge information gap that exists today between who barack obama is and who the voting public believes him to be he is not a muslim as you know with all due respect to muslims he is a stout straight up christian and he is very happy and proud about that
4515405 i think its important for us to celebrate the fact that sen
4515406 his marital history has been duly recorded caldwell said of mccain
4515407 many in the christian community have not forgotten what happened with sen mccain marrying his second wife one month after leaving his first wife it has not been forgotten by many in the christian community
4515408 our intention is to issue a positive ad for sen
4515409 but those facts about sen mccain are still in the background
4515410 i would like to go to amman to stand trial however what i fear is that i am convicted in advance

4515671 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

4515681 every night about six pm this guy is standing out on the driveway of bonds house and hes just talking just pretending to do a news report
4515682 he goes on and on about whats going on with bonds what bonds did that day whats going on with his court case what is coming in the mail for bonds what his kids are doing whatever its really creepy and to be honest im not even really a fan of barry
4515683 they stopped paying for my hotel and meals and stuff so ive just been sleeping in the drainage ditch across the street and ive just been kind of snacking on whatever i can find youd be surprised at the amount of stuff that grows on trees that you can eat without getting sick
4515684 listen im doing what i love getting the people of america the news they need and crave about barry bonds if its not for me pedro gomez then basically everyone in the united states will go on day in and day out without any news or information on barry bonds and what kind of life would that be
4515685 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others

4515693 weak and ratifies clintons sense of entitlement to share party leadership and the convention spotlight
4515694 begs the basic question is barack obama strong enough to be president
4515695 b y giving hillary clinton her place in history obama has demonstrated that his key character trait generosity of spirit is not only admirable it works
4515696 make many annoyed hillary supporters much happier or less self righteous
4515697 not to see the submission of mrs clintons name as a sign of weakness on mr obamas part

4515700 will not lead to the catharsis clinton keeps talking about and im not positive that catharsis is the goal
4515701 wake up the morning after hillarys name is placed in nomination and have a whole new lease on obama and my guess is hillary knows that
4515702 obama can afford to be gracious even to clinton since hell leave denver with the only prize that counts
4515703 ensures that the nominees showcase event will be about something more than the nominee himself
4515704 i highly doubt that anyone knows how to exploit this vulnerability

4515756 in the real world it looks like most scientists are quite willing to pursue wrong ideas so long as they are rewarded for doing so with a better chance of achieving more grants publications and status
4515757 this is enlightened self interest a powerful factor in scientific evaluation because the primary criterion of the validity of a theory is whether or not acting upon it will benefit the career of the scientist enlightened because the canny career scientist will be looking ahead a few years in order to prefer that theory which offers the best prospect of netting the next grant tenure promotion or prestigious job opportunity
4515758 when a new theory is launched it is unlikely to win converts unless they are rewarded with a greater chance of generous research funding the opportunity to publish in prestigious journals and the hope of increased status exemplified by admiration and respect from other scientists
4515759 theories may become popular or even dominant purely because of their association with immediate incentives and despite their scientific weaknesses
4515760 even the most conclusive hatchet jobs done on phoney theories will fail to kill or even weaken them when the phoney theories are backed up with sufficient economic muscle in the form of funding scientists will gravitate to where the money is so long as the funding stream is sufficiently deep and sustained
4515761 classical theory has it that a bogus hypothesis will be rejected when it fails to predict reality but this can be deferred almost indefinitely by the elaboration of secondary hypotheses which then require further testing and generates more work for the bogus believers
4515762 that the first theory is phoney and always was phoney is regarded as simplistic crass and a sign of lack of sophistication
4515763 and anyway there are massive sunk costs associated with the phoney theory including the reputations of numerous scientists who are now successful and powerful on the back of the phoney theory and who now control the peer review process including the allocation of grants publications and jobs
4515764 the zombification of science occurs when science based on phoney theories is serving a useful but non scientific purpose so it is kept going by continuous transfusions of cash from those whose interests it serves
4515765 for example if a branch of pseudo science based on a phoney theory is valuable for political reasons e g to justify government policies then real science expires and zombie science evolves
4515766 this can be explained away by yet further phoney theoretical elaborations especially when there is monopolistic control of information
4515767 in a nutshell zombie science is supported because it is useful propaganda and is deployed in arenas such as political rhetoric public administration management public relations marketing and the mass media generally indeed zombie science often comes across in the mass media as being more plausible than real science
4515768 personal careerist benefits seem easily able to overwhelm the benefits of trying to establish the real world of truth
4515769 in current science there seems to be a greater possibility that large scale change may be fashion rather than progress and such change may be serving propagandist goals rather than advancing scientific understanding
4515770 modern science may have a lumbering pace and its vast bulk means that once it has begun to move in a particular direction trying to deflect its path is like stopping a charging rhinoceros
4515771 perhaps funders co operate co ordinate and collude and therefore should be regarded as a cartel
4515772 individual ambition should ensure a sufficient supply of debunkers to keep the gardens of science weeded of bogus theories and to banish the zombies of science to the graveyards where they belong

4515896 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4515897 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4515898 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4515899 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4515900 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4515901 when it came to the studio you could say the 2 of us were joined at the hip
4515902 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4515903 we are showcasing it and trying to encourage other councils to use it
4515904 we suggest it might be a good idea to at least do la crm on a pilot basis
4515905 we can build a community with it and the community keeps building it developing it and keeping it alive
4515906 people over here like to get their hands on and influence change people here are used to having products brought in from outside over which they have no influence is a big international company interested in my little local needs
4515907 with the comprehensive spending review a lot of the funding for customer relations has dried up
4515908 councils now have to find their own money they are asking how to continue their crm strategy and are thinking of what might be cost effective
4515909 you need to be confident that these developers have the capability of developing that solution in a robust and best practice manner what if these people wanted to leave and set up their own company
4515910 dang i didnt know they were having any trouble at all
4515911 the only people applying an ideological orientation in education is the current government
4515912 they are trying to drive an agenda that places the market place above the values of citizenship the difference between labour and the government is that we support the right of equal access to education at every level from pre school to life long learning
4515913 the government is advancing an ideological position that what one can afford to pay will define access to education and the private sector are being invited to define the ethos of third level education
4515914 an opportunity is being missed to build on the irish reputation for having a well educated population that not only makes foreign direct investment very rewarding but much more importantly creates a confident citizenry with the capacity to participate in their society
4515915 the working group on third level education promised by minister okeeffe should not have terms of reference that merely reflect the narrow utilitarian vision of the government in relation to education but it should examine how a rich educational environment can be created that will meet the needs of citizen in the present and future generations
4515916 the fundamental difference between labours position and that of the present government is the priority we in labour gives to the requirement of citizenship defining the relationship between state economy and society
4515917 any plan to reintroduce third level fees would create a further roadblock to the creation of a more equal society
4515918 the public health implication of these findings can be huge
4515919 considering the burden of diabetes and its multiple long term complications
4515920 ive seen what may be the best futuristic anthology series since the glory days of the twilight zone and the outer limits its called masters of science fiction
4515921 you are a young man who is fascinated by firearms as evidenced by the nature of the rap music recorded on your mobile phone and sketches you drew of rifles
4515922 you also revealed to someone that you were in possession of other firearms worth 4 000
4515923 it is apparent to every citizen in this country that firearm offences have increased markedly and all too often they are in the hands of young men such as you who seem to think carrying a weapon and terrifying people is somehow acceptable
4515924 the message must go out to others similarly inclined that they will receive prison sentences of significant length
4515925 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long it is better to tell uncomfortable truths than to continue to claim that if we carry on as we are then things will turn out well just as we cant buck the market so we cant buck economic geography either places that enjoyed the conditions for creating wealth in the coal powered 19th century often do not do so today coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
4515926 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
4515927 is this the girl that is going to socialize happily with my other freakshow hippie friends
4515928 b ut also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously we consulted with security experts as well as with scholars of islam whom we asked to review the book and offer their assessments of potential reactions we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
4515929 stupid stuff my friends and i did when we were in high school
4515930 my grandfather only uses the very best quality popping corn
4515931 oy my god id like totally date him just its like i dont know
4515932 the xfx 9600gt xxx alpha dog edition provides a solid performance price card that easily fits into most gamer gamer budgets given its minimal power requirements and single slot cooler the 9600gt would be at home in the meekest oem computer or a mid range custom gaming computer the xfx 9600gt xxx alpha dog edition is definitely not the fastest option available on the market but it is one of the better buys when you are trying to get the best bang for your buck if you are gaming at 1280x1024 i would highly recommend the 9600gt as a solid purchase that will hold strong for another 12 months with medium to high quality settings in current and upcoming titles

4515935 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4515936 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4515937 one of the best uses of mobile he said is to enhance other channels with a mobile call to action
4515938 in these last 100 days before the election lets pour ourselves each and every one of us heart and soul into electing barack obama and giving him a filibuster proof senate
4515939 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4515940 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4515941 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4515942 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4515943 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4515944 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4515945 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4515946 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4515947 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
4515948 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4515949 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4515950 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4515951 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4515952 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4515953 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4515954 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4515955 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4515956 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4515957 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4515958 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4515959 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4515960 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4515961 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4515962 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4515963 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4515964 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4515965 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4515966 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4515967 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4515968 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4515969 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4515970 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4515971 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4515972 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4515973 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4515974 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4515975 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4515976 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4515977 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4515978 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4515979 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4515980 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4515981 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4515982 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4515983 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4515984 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4515985 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4515986 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4515987 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4515988 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4515989 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4515990 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4515991 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4515992 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4515993 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4515994 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4515995 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4515996 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4515997 there has been a decision there is a first collective agreement for gatineau for the garage
4515998 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4515999 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4516000 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4516001 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4516002 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4516007 the tampa bay lightning are thrilled to be involved in this historic event that will see us be the first club in national hockey league history to play a game in slovakia
4516008 we would like to thank hc slovan owner eric assimakopoulos for all of his efforts in making this game possible as we round out our exhibition schedule before opening the 2008 nhl season in prague
4516009 they want kwame to just go on his vacation and stay there
4516010 the press is going to be following him around the whole time hell create more disruption than any benefit there might be from having him there
4516011 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4516012 the focus of michigan should be on healing detroit and how the city intends to get back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4516013 no job no money no place to sleep who cares if id from that steeple leap
4516014 my name is henri b cheron if its work you need come with me in the bush youll make money son first up front you must pay a fee that long trip up north is not free a car is an expense agree

4516017 expect aching back sunburned arms work long hours but they feed you swell
4516018 if you want courses to be approved in private education so your students are qualified to attend uc institutions you must teach from a secular point of view
4516019 and what did they teach in these science classes at
4516020 we believe that ucs discrimination is clearly unconstitutional and violates the first amendment because uc is attempting to secularize christian schools
4516021 the uc is intent upon defending some right to discriminate unlawfully
4516022 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
4516023 they took my 400 out of my account immediately of course
4516024 banks should have to get their customers affirmative consent before signing them up for their most expensive loans
4516025 ive been working on reducing sky high overdraft fees for several years now
4516026 overdraft loans can be useful financial tools but many consumers are being enrolled in costly overdraft protection programs without their consent
4516027 in most cases banking customers can avoid overdrafting their accounts and paying any associated fee by knowing their balances
4516028 they can call pnc and we will automatically exclude them from the convenience of overdraft access for all atm transactions and purchases
4516029 if white evangelicals had not voted in 2004 kerry would have beaten bush by a 53 to 45 percent margin nationwide
4516030 neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of american politics and the agents of intolerance whether they be louis farrakhan or al sharpton on the left or pat robertson or jerry falwell on the right
4516031 when it comes to get out the vote efforts the mccain campaign appears to trail the obama campaign in both manpower and spending
4516032 and it seems that their field operation is not as built up as the bush cheney machine was at this point four years ago
4516033 in 2008 many conservative religious voters appear to have a broader issue agenda including climate change aids in africa and poverty
4516034 this broader agenda gives sen obama an opportunity to improve the democratic partys performance among these voters
4516035 community of christians inspired by the gospel mandate to put our faith into action to care for our neighbor especially the most vulnerable
4516036 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4516037 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4516038 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4516039 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4516040 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4516041 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4516042 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4516044 an australian woman has taken revenge on her cheating husband by auctioning his mistress s
4516045 it s not about the size of the ship but the motion of the ocean
4516046 the woman describes how she returned home early from work after her soon to be ex husband of 22 years mistakenly sent her a romantic text message meant for the other woman to find him discouraging her from entering their bedroom
4516047 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4516048 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4516049 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4516050 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4516051 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play

4516059 if kirkuk remains stable iraq will become more stable if kirkuk blows up iraq might fracture along ethnic and sectarian lines
4516060 the crisis is serious because the kurds can hold up any legislation they dont like such as the electoral law
4516061 it illustrates the importance of kirkuk as an unresolved issue in undermining political progress in iraq
4516062 if you turn it toward division it could divide entire iraq if you turn it toward unity then iraq will be in cohesion
4516063 we have not been able to return half of the displaced kurdish people to kirkuk
4516064 they have changed the turkish name of the delibas mosque into dilbas in kurdish
4516065 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4516066 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4516067 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4516068 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4516069 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4516070 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4516071 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4516072 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4516073 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4516074 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4516075 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4516076 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4516077 the state of illinois keeps telling us no but i dont care
4516078 when i wake up at 3 in the morning and i see my phone ringing i already know where im going
4516079 theyre generally not used to protect property or structures that are off the side of the road
4516080 i really dont want to move away from the people who have been very good to me
4516081 besides obama had to know who ayers is and what he stands for especially with ayers making this splash on 9 11

4516086 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4516087 its not the sentiments of men which make history but their actions
4516088 the world began without the human race and it will end without it
4516089 remember what is unbecoming to do is also unbecoming to speak of
4516090 worries about an economic slowdown in the united states and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market

4516092 it worked it was pretty rock solid within 25 to 30 miles of the transmitter at 30 40 miles it was intermittent over 40 miles away we had a few successes but thats where it dropped out
4516093 its nice to say that and hopefully we stay that way
4516094 this working draft then becomes sort of the proving ground for the standard
4516095 thats when third party implementers get a view of the standard and begin to build for it
4516096 theres got to be some sort of coordination between the people sending the service and the manufacturers making devices to receive the service that said there is more momentum on atsc mobile handheld than ive ever seen on anything else

4516100 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4516101 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4516102 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
4516103 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4516104 he is a very good player i like him very much but so do all the other coaches in the world
4516105 exactly what is happening with him i dont know at the moment
4516106 it is not my business it is the business for the board to talk about money
4516107 he is a fantastic player who could play in any team in the world but i am happy with my players at chelsea if one or two more players arrive it will be better for us

4516313 the near term is still going to look pretty challenging
4516314 but as you look further out this correction in commodity prices is decreasing inflation risks which takes the interest rate risks away for investors and gives the economies and the financial system more time to heal and ultimately a stronger rebound in the economy when it comes rather than short circuiting it with inflation fears and rate hikes that risk coming out is significant

4516354 the recent oil price move if sustained is a game changing event for the industry
4516355 i see it as the airlines restricting the availability of the lowest fares and forcing people to pay the higher fares that are already in place
4516356 its not easy to increase fares by double digit levels in a weak economy
4516357 i believe there will be between 4 and 10 successful airfare hikes the rest of this year depending on the price of oil

4516370 having cash now is like having him with us it is the silver lining
4516371 cash had to have found a water source somewhere the morning dew off of the grass or maybe she found a puddle somewhere

4516389 verily i came out to inform you about the night of qadr but such and such person were quarrelling so it was raised and maybe this is good for you however search for it in the ninth the seventh and the fifth
4516390 seek for the night of qadr decrees during the odd nights from the last ten nights of ramadaan
4516391 seek it in the last ten nights however if one of you becomes weak or is not able to then let him not be subdued by the last seven nights
4516392 whoever prays the night of qadr decrees with eemaan faith and hoping for its reward allah will forgive him all his previous sins
4516393 i said o messenger of allaah if i know what night is the night of qadr what should i say
4516394 say o allaah you are pardoning and you love to pardon so pardon me
4516395 when the last ten days of ramadaan arrived the messenger used to abstain from contact a with his wives and he would establish the nights he would awaken his family to do the same also
4516396 the messenger of allaah used to strive in ramadaan more than he did in any other month
4516397 on the morning of the night of qadr the sun would rise without any beams it is like a wash basin until it raises
4516398 we mentioned the night of qadr to the messenger of allaah and he said
4516399 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
4516400 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

4516454 the foe of causation by absences owes us an explanation of why we sometimes do say that an absence caused something the friend of causation by absences owes us an explanation of why we sometimes refuse to say that an absence caused something even when we have just the right pattern of dependence
4516455 one might have thought that lewis and beebee had domesticated the puzzle of causation by absence albeit in different ways after all they have both provided explanations of the folk judgments of causation by absence at odds with their metaphysical views however a closer look at folk judgments using experimental methods reveals significant shortcomings in their solutions pace lewis it is not the case that the folk merely fail to utter some sentences involving absences as causes rather the folk often deny such sentences pace beebee it is not the case that the pattern of folk assertions and denials of sentences that treat absences as causes may be accounted for by supposing that people con ate causation and causal explanation rather the folk do draw this distinction so both lewiss and beebees solutions to the puzzle of causation by absence fail to do justice to what the folk think

4516539 el presidente como comandante en jefe es en ltima instancia responsable por los contratistas en el campo de batalla y es decepcionante que esta administraci n no haya tenido la voluntad de dejar eso en claro en el tribunal

4516547 such officials will also be stripped of any party posts they hold and either allowed to remain members only under observation or expelled from the party altogether
4516548 use the platform of sermons and interpretations to propagate views which harm ethnic unity or talk of religious extremism or jihad or of pan islamism or pan turkism or the dissemination of slander or the defamation of government officials resulting in negative consequences
4516549 any officials overseeing a mosque which carries out unauthorized construction work or that builds in an overly conspicuous or grand manner
4516550 who turn a blind eye to what goes on and who do nothing to stop it and who neglect to report it will have lost political edge proper to a party official and could cause negative consequences and damage to society

4516571 sevilla football club is proud to be associated with 888 com and we thank them for their continued and generous support of our club support which goes far beyond the considerable financial contribution they have made in recent years

4516586 but they will clearly understand that the united states will not impose any real consequences if they do not make progress on human rights

4516706 according to a police document from the dutroux enquiry obtained by the sprout
4516707 in these documents a police source and senior psychotherapist informed a colleague of a session he had been having with a client the client disclosed the details of events in verviers where wathelet was mayor during 1992 he spoke of
4516708 these children between 8 and 10 years old had come from a childrens home with the complicity of the director of the home
4516709 this case was never investigated as the police report confirms the 2 dossiers on the child welfare services have disappeared
4516710 three years after this report wathelet became belgiums minister for defence in june 1995 but was rapidly nominated to the post of belgiums representative at the european court of justice in luxembourg where he arrived on the 2nd september
4516711 this is illustrated by a briefing i have had from the nspcc counsellor working alongside us
4516712 my clients and others know far more than has been given to the police already
4516713 i can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up there are people on the island who just dont want us going down the route of this inquiry

4516787 you would normally expect the mortgage rate to follow the term deposit rate downwards
4516788 its funny earlier this week we heard that one of the reasons banks could not cut mortgage rates was the high returns being paid to savers
4516789 now we are seeing savings rates falling and the banks still arent cutting rates they are running out of excuses
4516790 its classic profiteering the banks think everybody is keeping a close eye on mortgage rates and has forgotten about savings rates and credit cards
4516791 as for raising their credit card rates now you can make your own mind up about that there is simply no excuse
4516792 we take any changes to interest rates very seriously taking into account the total cost of funds competitive pressures and impact on customers these are the factors behind this particular card interest rate change

4516797 there is no credible evidence that airborne products will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4516798 airborne however when used as directed does not prevent class action lawsuits charges of deceptive advertising or according to the government the common cold
4516799 under a settlement announced yesterday the privately held airborne health based in bonita springs fla will add 6 5 million to funds it has already agreed to pay to settle a related class action lawsuit that suit which alleged that airborne falsely claimed its products could cure or prevent colds was settled earlier this year for 23 5 million consumers who bought airborne products between 2001 and 2008 have until sept 15 to apply for a refund for as many as six purchases the ftc said claims will be paid by oct 15 2008 the company said in a statement
4516800 even if airborne isnt doing anything for you believing it helps
4516801 i cant tell you the last time i had a cold
4516802 its important to note that this is a settlement over older advertising and labeling and has nothing to do with public safety

4516842 the trouble had already assumed the communal character which it was to retain throughout at the time it was mainly in the northern half of the city later reports indicate that the muslims were in an aggressive mood from early in the day and that their processions were well armed with lathis iron rods and missiles
4516843 this tour that convinced me that the reports that i had received of the seriousness of the situation had erred on the side of underestimation i observed very great damage to property and streets littered with corpses
4516844 i made another tour of inspection this time with the army commander and the chief minister covering large areas in the south and south east of the city which i had not visited before the chief minister showed an exasperating preoccupation with the sufferings undergone by members of his own community

4516859 ich bin sehr gl cklich mit der heutigen performance weil wir einfach nicht das richtige setup hatten
4516860 ich denke das haben wir gr tenteils dem neuen streckenbelag zu verdanken die strecke war sehr schmutzig und das hat es sehr schwierig gemacht das bike zu kontrollieren ich kam in die box wir haben an der maschine ein paar sachen ver ndert und gegen ende der morgensitzung war das fahrgef hl schon ganz gut
4516861 am nachmittag haben wir noch mehr sachen ver ndert und mit dem neuen setup komme ich klasse zurecht meine rundenzeiten sind nicht so schlecht aber ich denke ich kann das noch weiter verbessern
4516862 wir haben dazu alle mittel ich muss aber etwas an meinem rhythmus arbeiten die gute nachricht ist dass ich nach meiner verletzung wieder zu 100 prozent fit bin mein zustand ist gro artig und ich m chte dieses wochenende dem team etwas gutes zur ckgeben nach den vergangenen rennen k nnen sie so was gut gebrauchen

4516864 die maschine war von anfang an sehr gut und wir haben auf unser basis setup zur ckgegriffen mit dem wir in den vergangenen paar rennen so erfolgreich waren
4516865 wir t ftelten ein paar neue modifikationen aus und legen ein paar longruns hin um die haltbarkeit auf dem neuen belag zu testen es scheint gut zu funktionieren jetzt haben wir noch ein paar sachen zu tun um die wir uns morgen k mmern m ssen ich freue mich sehr auf das wochenende und hoffe dass das wetter gut bleibt

4516886 on this one aspect morgan tsvangirai requested for some time to go and reflect and consult and then come back to the process i must emphasise that three times in our discussions morgan tsvangirai was agreeable to that aspect and thrice he changed his mind in the end he said he wanted an opportunity to reflect and consult and then re engage in the process
4516887 the people of zimbabwe demand a solution to their circumstances and as a political party we are trying to play our role in terms of providing leadership in pursuit of that political settlement
4516888 we are committed to a solution that ensures tangible deliverables are put on the table of zimbabweans a solution that must thus put the people first not leadership positions and titles
4516889 it has never been an all inclusive negotiation the exclusion of other stakeholders such as the civil society organisations was a mistake all this confirms that it was all about power sharing between three political parties

4516894 when ian smith was cornered in the 1970s by the intensifying liberation war the south african prime minister advised him that it was time to negotiate with the nationalists
4516895 however smith was stubborn he ignored the nationalists in mozambique and zambia and instead chose to negotiate with sithole muzorewa and chief chirau whom he considered black moderates

4516905 the increases were broad based but the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it
4516906 theres less employment theres less wealth and now banks are restraining credit
4516907 we just dont see where the consumer is going to get the money
4516908 the large increases in consumer expenses means that household income is actually declining when adjusted for inflation
4516909 confidence does not improve when the standard of living is declining and with unemployment claims still quite high we cannot expect much out of the consumer
4516910 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july
4516911 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale

4516917 the other day we looked at the smooth creations asylum and inside was the new diamond hd 4870 xoc black edition this isnt your normal overclocked hd 4870 though if you have a look at the specifications on the thing you will quickly discover that the card is packing some mega serious clock speeds so what weve done is pull the card out of the smooth creations rig and install it into our testbed to see how the card performs against some of our other favorites since this wasnt a retail sample we wont be looking at the package today what we will do is have a quick look around the card and then check out the clockspeeds before moving onto the testing phase

4516924 at utility truck services we have been expanding our fleet inspection and maintenance services and we needed an effective way to manage these inspections

4516926 utility truck services is focused on ensuring that their customers fleets are compliant with all department of transportation dot ansi and osha requirements which makes them a perfect fit for field id
4516927 this also marks our entry into fleet truck inspections we are extremely excited to be working with an industry leader such as utility truck services

4516929 we commend cida for matching funds that canadians generously donated for both emergencies
4516930 this additional funding will help unicef continue the very important humanitarian work that is being done to make sure that children are safe healthy and in school despite the crises they have been experiencing
4516931 i would like to thank most sincerely the thousands of canadians who responded promptly to our emergency appeals to help children and families in distress
4516932 through their contributions canadians have touched many children affected by these two natural disasters unfortunately the recovery work is far from finished and unicef canada will continue to accept donations for children and families in myanmar and china to help both of these countries rebuild and rehabilitate

4516942 concerted well orchestrated campaigns of harassment meant to intimidate and terrorize individuals many of whom are involved in potentially life saving research
4516943 it is time to enact legislation that gives law enforcement the tools necessary to protect researchers from the extremists who terrorize them
4516944 this bill by creating a new misdemeanor for the public posting of the personal information of researchers and a new misdemeanor for trespass does just that
4516945 this campaign of violence is having a significant impact on the research community at universities across california and the nation

4516998 we will have all of the standard precautions and services in place that we would at any other show including stagehands ushers ticket takers venue security police fire paramedics etc
4516999 every event booked into the building must also meet our insurance requirements and this show will be no exception from our perspective this will really be no different than any other event we book into any of our facilities
4517000 there are a lot of volunteers a lot of people volunteering their time and making sure this goes off without a hitch
4517001 real change doesnt come from crossing your fingers and hope you get a better president next time weve had abominable wars under democratic administrations as well it feels like were on this train that is hell bound and theres no way to do anything about it what we fail to do now will determine the path the country goes in
4517002 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
4517003 almost all the malayalees in the the 1960s are familiar with isbens work and can identify with the film very few of the new generation might have heard about the norwegian playwright as an actor i feel it is a blessing for me i feel honoured and lucky to be a part of this film
4517004 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
4517005 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it

4517007 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
4517008 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4517009 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4517016 das heck f hlt sich fantastisch an ich bin 15 runden ohne probleme gefahren und hatte konstanten grip aber die vorderreifen sind noch nicht ganz da
4517017 uns erwartet viel harte arbeit mit michelin aber da die strecke sauberer wird bekommen wir mehr leben aus den reifen und der griplevel ist auch nicht so schlecht
4517018 leider f hle ich mich seit ein paar tagen nicht besonders gut wodurch ich mich heute ziemlich schwach gef hlt habe es hat mir sogar schon sehr viel kraft gekostet die handschuhe anzuziehen
4517019 mit ein bisschen m digkeit kann ich ja noch gut umgehen aber heute konnte ich nur ein paar runden fahren da ich dann bereits starke bauchkr mpfe bekam das ist besonders f r meine mannschaft bitter denn ich war nicht in der lage viele zusammenh ngende runden zu fahren und daten zu sammeln wir hatten ja bereits heute morgen probleme das richtige setup zu finden

4517029 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
4517030 we are now going to setup this university dedicated for the education of security aspects and various other aspects to handle the rising shadow of terrorism the university will be dedicated to people across the globe fallen prey to terrorists and this will help us to kill the terrorist ideas more effectively
4517031 the idea once implemented will help security agencies immensely and also taking the note of lack of terrorism combat experts in government agencies this university can contribute a lot developing a much better manpower to handle terrorism and terrorist activities across the nation

4517034 greek culture it seems logical to use a form of communication that works well in that culture if i was in the middle east in biblical times i would used a different style just like if i was in a tiny nomadic village i would use a different style around a campfire but in our culture this still seems to be a powerful way of communicating look at the presidential campaigns
4517035 i had discussions with chief minister lim guan eng but were not in favour of declaring a public holiday
4517036 to me it is not only unfortunate but irresponsible on the part of the election commission to conduct elections knowing that the most of them voters particularly the state constituency of seberang jaya are factory workers
4517037 not only seberang jaya up to bayan baru and bagan which means that they have to take a half a day off which is very difficult
4517038 youre a factory worker in kulim in neighbouring kedah what do you do unless youre given almost a day off you are not able to vote you cant come back in two hours back and forth you cant
4517039 i hope to win comfortably but im not too particular about the numbers because i know i am against the entire machinery the federal government machinery and the party
4517040 im not underestimating their strength in terms of money i think hundreds of millions of ringgit will be poured and their dirty tactics in terms of malicious scurrilous attacks and also the use of the government resources even intimidation
4517041 i cannot imagine rm218 million in 2004 elections just on posters and banners by the federal not yet for the party divisions and the states we are talking about hundreds of millions of ringgit
4517042 im not taking this for granted im appealing to my supporters my friends work very hard to meet every single constituent and ill try to cover as many places as possible
4517043 with 219 parliamentary seats and 505 state seats contested in the 2004 general elections this means that a party like bn that contested all seats cannot spend more than rm94 3 million or else bns victories are illegal
4517044 with rm218 million spent whether by bn or umno on campaign materials alone this is more than double the legally permitted amount
4517045 however this may now be an academic question since the 2004 general election has been superseded by the 2008 general election
4517046 but the elections commissions failure to act and question the legality of the 2004 general election victories by the bn government not only makes a mockery of the very election laws it has drafted but also the spirit of democracy that votes should not be bought and sold
4517047 russia right now wants at least half of ukraine to be annexed
4517048 vladimir putin talked about that rather openly at the nato summit in bucharest romania in april ukraine will disintegrate into two halves and we want the eastern half including of course first and foremost crimea
4517049 if russia openly challenges ukrainian sovereignty i think that ukraine will then turn to the west and say you know guys theyre challenging our sovereignty with their fleet and this will happen without any kind of use of arms or anything made in anger ukraine right now apparently wants to make the threat to its sovereignty obvious to outside powers
4517050 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4517051 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4517052 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4517053 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4517054 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4517055 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia

4517058 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4517059 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4517060 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

4517065 maybe this is a new trend by microsoft issuing kill bit updates to mitigate risks
4517066 if microsoft was patching one of its own activex controls i would think it would say its fixing something in activex but because its labeled this as kill bit it leads me to think that it involves a third party
4517067 one of the most diverse and interesting in a long time it runs the gamut as far as the distribution of where they are in the operating system and software the only thing were missing is a vulnerability for excel or outlook and wed have one for everything that microsoft makes
4517068 but i dont think it would have something this quick
4517069 a lot of people will be looking at this one
4517070 does the vulnerability carry over into the mobile side or is it only around the desktop
4517071 active directory is such a critical core component large enterprises will certainly need to roll out these two and it will take them some time because of the testing theyll need to do

4517073 i believe george has severe anger management issues georges anger is constant and persistent
4517074 he is unable to control his anger in front of the children george would criticise and pick fights with pam or the nannies
4517075 george faulted me with the incident and yelled at me that i was useless in front of son georgie
4517076 when i asked george if he was serious in blaming me for such an incident he fired me on the spot and sent me to my room to pack my belongings while he stood over me in an intimidating way
4517077 george then realised that since pam was away and he was incapable of handling the three children on his own that he needed me to stay
4517078 i agreed to stay because i was concerned for the kids and i had promised pam i would take good care of the kids in her absence
4517079 it was a very scary incident pam terminated our trip early because of georges drinking and angry rages
4517080 we know their quality they know our quality but we havent seen them play so its difficult to pass judgement on them im sure it will be a good game between two evenly matched teams
4517081 but the most important thing for us is to go step by step like we did before were focused on the game against nigeria tomorrow and were going to try and win it after that well be in the semi finals we have the team to do it and we are all determined to go as far as we can
4517082 the fact that the manager gerard gili trusts me enough to give me the responsibility means a lot hes trying to bring his methods to all of the ivorian teams both on and off the pitch in an attempt to raise our standards but the best thing about being the captain is having the support from my team mates
4517083 everyone has his own style but you know didier is the man back home and all of the young players look to him and try to do as well as he has done
4517084 hes a big influence on my career i always try to learn from the best and he is a great example to any aspiring footballer

4517097 about two years ago i watched mary kate smoke a marijuana joint and pass it on to friends when they were all at a party together
4517098 then there were her friends who definitely did drugs i especially remember three hangers on two guys and a girl i would call them drug dealers
4517099 i saw them with cocaine and they also tried to provide it to other people i also saw them with pures which are tablets like ecstasy
4517100 because shes so tiny a little booze would have a big effect on her
4517101 colleagues told me that on at least two occasions she had so much to drink that she had to be carried to her car
4517102 even in high school she liked to drink vodka with fruit juice or mixer mary kate would get so blasted that her sister ashley would pull her aside and tell her to stop
4517103 when she was 16 her weight dropped below 80 pounds i remember ashley telling me at the time mary kate just wont eat my family is going nuts we didnt know what to do so we put her in the hospital
4517104 wed try to get her to eat but shed only get mad and growl just leave me alone if im not hungry im not hungry
4517105 mary kate also smoked cigarettes constantly and she filled up on alcohol shed drink anything available jack daniels vodka whatever
4517106 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4517107 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights

4517121 their attacks on schools teachers and others working on education are systematic not random
4517122 they are part of a deliberate attack on human rights on equality for women and on any attempt by their fellow citizens to control their own destiny
4517123 there must be an end to impunity for those who attack schools students and educators
4517124 intensify efforts to put an end to the growing pattern of attacks

4517135 i get asked about beyonc all the time but i try and make fun of it
4517136 sometimes i say shes not my sister other times i say ive stuffed her in my suitcase and sent it to dubai
4517137 i have to have fun with it or ill turn into britney shave my head and go totally crazy
4517138 i get a lot of wrinkled noses because of how outspoken i am
4517139 solange knowles ill shave my head and go totally crazy
4517140 i had to deal with it on my way up now im dumping it all on you
4517141 when you earn more respekts you can get more free clothing blah blah blah
4517142 i am really happy with todays performance because after the first couple of laps this morning i was a bit worried because we just hadnt got the setting right
4517143 i think that was mostly down to the new surface and it was a bit dirty and made it very difficult to control the bike
4517144 i came into the box and we made some changes to the bike and by the end of this mornings session the feeling was good we made a lot more changes this afternoon and with the new setting i felt really good on the bike
4517145 my lap time is not too bad but i think we can improve on that we have the power and i need to work on my rhythm a bit
4517146 one of the best things today is that i am nearly at 100 after the injury my condition is great and this weekend i want to give the team something good because after recent races they really need it
4517147 the bike worked well straight out of the crate and we used the base setting that we have had success with at the last couple of races
4517148 we are working on a few modifications and doing some longer runs on the tyres to test the durability on the new surface
4517149 we sat down at the shop we talked about it signed the paperwork and i told tony the bottom line is i want to have fun i want to have fun with you
4517150 i know he wants to have fun doing this and thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately just due to the fact that with penske racing we had success in 2002 2003 and part of 2004 and since then it hasnt been i would say as successful and therefore some of the fun has gone with that and i look forward to having fun again
4517151 without naming names there were an easy three other teams that made me offers
4517152 but it was mostly tony i saw the shop i saw the backbone of the foundation in the house was laid with their efforts and talking to tony and his people it seemed to be the right decision for the right reasons and thats what it was all about
4517153 i would say i felt like i was fortunate having options to have that possibility to go to what i thought was the best place to do the best thing for me and my long term goals
4517154 its going to take some time from a building standpoint from a personnel standpoint to be where we want to be as far as the chase goes and championship contending teams and organisations
4517155 i want to have that influence i want to have that communication and i want to be successful with tony and with the organisation doing so its just a matter of being in the right time at the right place just like anything else in the world
4517156 yeah the chevrolet part of it im excited about obviously
4517157 tony is super excited about it and its a new deal for me so i look forward to put chevrolet on victory lane
4517158 with the tie to hendrick obviously its going to be a good thing and its part of the reason why i think its going to be successful and i look forward to driving what currently even now is a hendrick car at stewart haas racing
4517159 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
4517160 i cant fault two runs we were right in the game

4517166 hoe je het draait of keert mensen blijven roddelen wat je ook doet het zal nooit goed zijn voor hen tenslotte moet je niet kijken wat de mensen over je zeggen of denken je moet weten van uit jezelf wat je goede en slechte daden en verandering in brengen waar nodig is

4517170 hoe kan een mens die van god houdt zo heftig zijn
4517171 je hebt een lange tijd met me doorgebracht wat heb je geleerd
4517172 ik heb acht dingen geleerd 1 ik keek naar de schepping iedereen heeft een geliefde wanneer hij het graf in gaat laat hij zijn geliefde achter daarom heb ik mijn goede daden tot mijn geliefde gemaakt op die manier zullen ze bij me zijn in het graf 2 ik keek naar het vers doch voor hem die vreesde voor zijn heer te staan en die zijn ziel van begeerten onthield 79 40 en worstelde daarom tegen mijn verlangens zodat ik allah kon blijven gehoorzamen 3 ik zag dat als iemand iets waardevols bij zich heeft hij het zal beschermen toen dacht ik aan het vers hetgeen gij hebt zal voorbijgaan maar hetgeen bij allah is is blijvend 16 96 daarom wijdde ik alles wat me iets waard was toe aan hem zodat het bij hem zou zijn voor mij 4 ik zag de mensen zoeken naar rijkdom eer en posities en het was me niets waard toen dacht ik aan allahs woorden voorwaar de meest edele van jullie is bij allah degene die het meest allah vreest 49 13 dus deed ik mijn best om bewust te worden van allah om edel te zijn in zijn ogen 5 ik zag de mensen jaloers zijn op elkaar en ik keek naar het vers wij zijn het die in het tegenwoordige leven middelen van bestaan onder hen uitdelen 43 32 dus verliet ik jaloezie 6 ik zag de mensen vijandigheid hebben en ik dacht aan het vers voorwaar satan is een vijand van u behandelt hem daarom als vijand 35 6 dus verliet ik vijandigheid en nam de satan als mijn enige vijand 7 ik zag dat ze zichzelf verlaagden op zoek naar voorzieningen en ik dacht aan het vers en er is geen schepsel dat op aarde kruipt of zijn voorziening berust bij allah 11 6 dus hield ik mezelf bezig met mijn verantwoordelijkheden tegenover hem en ik liet mijn eigendom bij hem 8 ik zag dat ze vertrouwden op hun zaken gebouwen en gezondheid en ik dacht aan het vers en voor hem die zijn vertrouwen in allah stelt is allah toereikend 65 3 en daarom plaats ik mijn vertrouwen alleen in bismi llahi al rahmani al rahiem in de naam van god de erbarmer de meest barmhartige het verhaal van zuster sofie a salaam ailekoum ik heb nog niet echt een verhaal te vertellen mijn naam is sofie ik ben 18 jaar en ik woon in belgi ik ben opgevoed in een normaal christelijk gezin nu 6 maanden geleden heb ik mijn huidige vriend leren kennen die marokkaans is ik ging ook steeds meer bij onze buren op bezoek die ook moslim zijn de islam is mij steeds meer en meer beginnen te interesseren en ik ben er over beginnen te informeren ik ga sinds dit jaar naar een hogeschool en daar heb ik contact gelegd met een moslim van mijn klas en hij zei onmiddellijk van onze eerste ontmoeting dat ik een goede moslima ging worden incha allah en dat hij mij hierbij ging helpen na een tijdje ben ik dan ook toevallig via internet in contact gekomen met een belgisch meisje dat zich bekeerd heeft ik zag dit en zie dit nog altijd als een teken van allah sinds ik dat meisje en de jongen leren kennen heb ben ik er zeker van geworden dat ik een goede moslima wil worden inchaallah ik heb de sjahadda uitgesproken en spreek hem nog dagelijks uit voor het slapengaan deze woorden geven mij steeds opnieuw een goed gevoel sinds dit jaar heb ik ook de ramadan meegedaan ik voelde mij zeer goed tijdens deze maand en ik voelde mij echt verbonden met allah en alle moslims rondom mij de drang om te bidden voor allah is bij mij zeer groot maar nog niet zo simpel om uit te voeren bij mij thuis aangezien ik een jongere zus heb die mij niet zo vaak alleen laat ik ga zeer binnenkort ook voor de eerste keer naar de moskee ik zie hier erg naar uit want het is mijn doel de koran te begrijpen en mijn manier van leven islam op een goede wijze verder te zetten inchaallah de reden dat ik deze brief stuur is omdat ik graag meer contacten zou leggen met zusters die vroeger ook geen moslimas waren en bekeerd zijn ik woon nog thuis momenteel en mijn ouders zouden het niet aanvaarden dat ik deze weg gekozen heb zeker mijn vader niet maar langs de andere kant gaat hij wel akkoord met mijn relatie en het feit dat ik binnenkort met hem zal gaan trouwen inchaallah misschien dat het contact met andere zusters en verhalen mij zullen kunnen helpen bij mijn keuze bedankt op voorhand en inchaallah dat zulke sites blijven bestaan ze zijn een zeer grote steun http beheerpagina web log nl t trackback 66883 1562774 beste sofia graag wil ik met jou in contact komen om meer over islam hebben te praten ik vind schrijven niet altijd prettig en heb weinig tijd voor mail me aub en we zullen hele leuke tijden meemaken in islam slm sofia ik heb je verhaal gelezen en ik vind het zeer mooi dat je uzelf verder wilt verdiepen in de islam ikzelf ben ook een belgische moslima ik heb mij bekeerd tot de islam na de geboorte van mijn eerste kind ik besefte plots met hulp van mijn schoonfamilie dat iedereen als moslim geboren wordt en dat het voor mij tijd werd om terug te keren naar mijn geloof inshallah kunnen we in contact komen als je dit zelf wil dan kunnen we elkaar misschien helpen om onze kennis in islam uit te breiden nog veel succes met je zoektocht naar allah moge allah je hierbij helpen je zuster sara geplaatst door sara slm sofia ik ben een somalische meisje die alhamdoellillaah moslim opgevoed is we worden immers allemaal als moslim geboren maar het is de vraag of je ook zo blijft deze wereld is maar tijdelijk en verleidelijk maae wie kan diegene leiding geven terwijl allaah diegene heeft doen dwalen ik zeg je wees dankbaar wees dankbaar want van heel je familie heeft allaah jou gekozen om je leiding te geven op het rechte pad moge allaah jou daar het verdere mee helpen het doet me altijd goed om verhalen van bekeerde moslimas te lezen oow zo mooi soebhanaallah natuurlijk is de islam het ware geloof daar wordt je in beschermd rechtvaardig behandeld enz iedereen krijgt wat ie toebehoort insha laah asalamou alikum rahmatoellah allah wabaraktuh moge allah over mijn broeders en zusters wake en de ongelovige leiden amien ik zal me even voorstellen ik ben een nederlandse oegti ik ben 15 jaar alhamdoelilah en ik ben bekeerd toen ik 13 jaar was zoals je kan zien aan me leeftijd lijkt het net van echt kan dat ja ik was op een vroege leeftijd volwassen zoals de meeste van jullie bekeerde alhamdoelilah moge allah ons leiding geven amien en ik draag al 2jaar niqaab alhamdoelilah mijn aanraking met islam kwam in groep 8 toen we voor het eerst naar een moskee gingen ik voelde me echt goed in de moskee omdat het me eerste keer was in een moskee dus dat was een goed gevoel daarna wou ik me hoofddoek niet meer afdoen subhanallah saddaq allahoe adziem en toen sinds die dag ben ik meer gaan praktiseren in islam ik zou het leuk vinden om meer in aanraking te komen met nederlandse oegtis of van andere afkomst die aan het praktiseren zijn ik geef lezingen en quran lessen dus wie wil komen mag mijn altijd toevoegen fi sabilillah hotmail com moge allah over jullie wake en jullie leiding geven amien voorwaar allah soubhanallah wa ta3laa houd van de gene die op hem vertrouwd

4517191 het is gebaseerd op het feit dat de acteur russisch bloed heeft
4517192 het is ongelooflijk wat een ophef er ontstaat als een vrouw met een man gaat die maanden terug is gescheiden van zijn echtgenote
4517193 het is verschrikkelijk je vraagt je af wanneer het een keer ophoudt
4517194 de eerste plaats in de b finale leek er voor een buitenstaander misschien in te zitten maar bij ons liep het vat in die laatste honderd meter helemaal af ik zag op ons boordcomputertje dat we nog net achtendertig slagen per minuut haalden ik joeg nog het tempo de hoogte in maar heb nooit meer geweten hoe snel we roeiden naar verluidt haalden we de veertig zo snel deden we nog nooit al merkte ik daar niets van want op dat moment zag ik nog enkel zwart voor mijn ogen
4517195 achtste eindigen en dit nadat we pas begin juni hoorden dat we samen zouden zitten niemand durfde zon resultaat voorspellen wij zijn in dit toernooi nog echt gegroeid uiteindelijk waren we niet eens een lengte van de a finale af een achtste plaats en een olympisch diploma dit smaakt toch wel naar meer wellicht behouden we ons profstatuut en kunnen we de volgende jaren op dit elan doorgaan al willen we daar nu geen seconde langer aan denken feestvieren en nog tien dagen genieten in peking lijken me een terechte beloning
4517196 dan zullen wij in de toekomst net zo reageren als wij nu hebben gedaan
4517197 het is nu tijd om de blik op de toekomst te werpen
4517198 jean marie dedecker had maar de helft van de middelen die het judo nu heeft dan moet je kiezen en hij heeft gekozen voor de top voor onmiddellijk resultaat nu hebben we twee keer zoveel middelen maar ze worden slecht besteed als ik jean marie mag parafraseren als je je geld in ezels steekt moet je geen koerspaarden verwachten
4517199 het directiecomit van de vjf wil duidelijk stellen dat zij unaniem haar topsportco rdinator steunt en blijft steunen in haar topsportbeleid
4517200 de ontgoocheling van het verlies voor danny en zijn atleten is groot maar de schuld in gellas schoenen schuiven is te goedkoop om waar te zijn dat gella het moet ontgelden als storende factor en zondebok toont een gebrek aan respect danny heeft van de vjf het afgelopen jaar carte blanche gekregen met ruime financi le middelen wat hij ook moge beweren gella heeft er zelf voor gepleit om de persoonlijke trainers mee te sturen naar peking iets waar zij alleen maar kon van dromen een beetje dankbaarheid van zijnentwege zou hier wel op zijn plaats zijn
4517201 de frustraties van dannys ontslag als tsc door de beheerraad van de vjf twee jaar geleden zijn duidelijk nog niet verteerd danny heeft de structuur van het gouden beleid laten kapot gaan gella moest het puin ruimen dat danny heeft achtergelaten het is duidelijk dat het hier om een persoonlijke afrekening gaat men mag gella niet verantwoordelijk stellen voor het wan beleid van v r haar aanstelling het siert haar dat zij de uitdaging is aangegaan om een zinkend schip weer varend te maken na 6 maanden van crisismanagement was er terug stabiliteit in de federatie en nu staat er opnieuw een structuur die op lange termijn zal renderen mits een getalenteerde generatie atleten
4517202 het is bon ton om het bloso boic kabinet en federaties aan te vallen maar moeten de atleten en persoonlijke trainers niet eens in vraag gesteld worden
4517203 het wordt tijd dat ook zij eens in eigen boezem kijken in plaats van excuses te vinden of anderen de schuld te geven eddy vinckier en gella vandecaveye hebben tijdens het vorige beleid nooit van iemand steun gekregen en hebben zich toch een weg gebaand met het gekende palmares als gevolg jean marie dedecker is niet meer up to date want hij is reeds 10 jaar van het judotoneel verdwenen en heeft van schelden en natrappen zijn hobby gemaakt
4517204 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4517205 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4517206 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4517207 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4517208 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4517209 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4517210 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4517211 the growth momentum is very strong and the upward trend on employment and poverty reduction is healthy
4517212 the main worry is inflation it will be a couple of months before the central bank and we get it down to single digits again
4517213 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4517214 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4517215 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4517216 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4517217 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4517218 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4517219 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4517220 it was no longer about saving the country but about stopping the crimes
4517221 every american anthem deserves a rockin music video and thats exactly what we made

4517228 reaching the 1 billion benchmark in august is the fastest the studio has achieved this success and puts it on track to its most successful year in history
4517229 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4517230 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights

4517235 the launch of android is an important milestone in the industry
4517236 this process ensures we have an opportunity to receive feedback from users
4517237 at the end of july we still had 21 4 million cash on hand which gives us plenty of money in addition to our ongoing fundraising to prosecute a very active campaign in the month of august
4517238 by the end of august we will be able and happy to report that we have no more cash on hand in the old primary account that being said we will have access to over 100 million in the first week of september
4517239 we found there was a much higher rate of return and as a burgeoning company we slowly realised that we could access factual content much more easily and there was a better payoff from it
4517240 i would make the claim that we are canadas leading boutique distributor of factual programming
4517241 it will come as no surprise to hear that its become so difficult to place one hours that weve become very selective about what we take on
4517242 we want them of course to be relevant to be on a subject thats either really shocking or headline grabbing
4517243 theres a lot of really important compelling meaningful work out there and those documentaries work very well on the festival circuit and if theyre high profile enough they can certainly work on pbs or on terrestrial broadcasters
4517244 but in terms of placing one hours on cable theyve really got to be able to draw headlines and attract press
4517245 as opposed to the traditional discovery or nat geo now were going much more broadly
4517246 its fun its a challenge and its putting us in touch with a whole new group of people
4517247 it broadens the array of broadcasters who might be interested in it
4517248 theres such a huge appetite for celebrity related programming its become its own sort of mini niche within the factual genre
4517249 even if broadcasters are running fiction whether its series or movies this kind of programming is relevant because it focuses on the celebrity element
4517250 its a food show but by no means is it a standard cooking show
4517251 you have these three young guys really a great rapport there and they get together and kind of brainstorm about ideas related to food and then they mash it up in the studio and create an apparatus related to that idea the genesis the germ of the idea is related to food but then its also a bit of science a bit of technology its a hybrid genre which can be very appealing
4517252 recession is coming normality has to take place and in this process there are bound to be survivors and those who get hurt
4517253 we are lucky in the sense that within misc we have for the last three years prepared ourselves for the downturn by enhancing our resilience factor
4517254 now we are on the lookout for those who do not survive the slump and will move from there if it is cheap and reasonable enough we may consider it
4517255 in the current situation where costs are rising we are building up resilience and anticipate that our initiatives will reduce our operating cost by 20 per cent
4517256 commodity prices are at historical highs and at the same time we are in the middle of a global credit crunch
4517257 this is happening already in the industry but for misc we have not reached that point
4517258 while being better positioned to ride current headwinds freight rates are expected to come under increasing pressure in the short term as supply of new ships outstrips demand in the petroleum and container shipping sector
4517259 its panic and the central bank is not doing anything

4517277 i started searching for a memory in memory of my late mother in law who had been estranged from my husband for 34 years i found her 11 months before she died and thought as a tribute to her i would continue tracing to help other people find their loved ones over the years i would like to think i have had a great deal of success i have used various resources during this time and through a recommendation from a friend began to use tracesmart for their excellent facility there is no better search facility available online

4517281 when i read this short story i somehow knew those rooms and could see those people and hear the sounds of the piano
4517282 i used to write a fair amount when i was younger but ive been away from short stories for a while until sfx started the pulp idol contest and that gave me a pretext to get back into it i was wondering what if a miracle actually happened and thats the idea that sparked the story of charlies angel it was a useful discipline writing to the strict word limit

4517284 we are fortunate that we have our own maritime academy called the malaysian maritime academy alam we train about 500 to 550 seafarers a year
4517285 while there are other maritime academies that exist worldwide such as in the philippines indonesia iran egypt and singapore we are slightly different from the rest
4517286 we provide the total package we put alam cadets onboard our vessels that travel all over the world
4517287 recently two foreign companies came forward to provide training berths on their ships for alam trainees while local shipowners have yet to take up the call
4517288 that is a disappointment because we are undertaking a national project to make malaysia a maritime nation
4517289 new englands largest wind farm generating enough electricity to power 50 000 homes
4517290 it would mean we could be mandated to bring on renewable resources much faster than we need them have the transmission capacity for them or can afford to pay for them
4517291 this is a well intentioned bill that was written by people who are not very knowledgeable
4517292 they hired people who frankly dont know what they are talking about
4517293 i couldnt go with him to the dealer so i signed the form and he took it up however he said afterwards that id signed the wrong part
4517294 i signed the right part and attached it to a form to get a refund from the road tax and a friend who works at the dvla took it in for me and put it in the internal mail
4517295 i contacted them about the lost document and they said i had to pay because i was still liable for the fine
4517296 letters were exchanged back and forth and the last letter i got from them was in august it said the dvla deals with millions of documents on a regular basis and they said some could be misplaced like in this case
4517297 i took that to be an admission that theyd lost my documents
4517298 the dvla strives to provide an excellent service to its customers we cannot comment on individual cases
4517299 where a vehicle keeper fails to tax or sorn their vehicle we issue a late licensing penalty
4517300 this is a proven system which fundamentally relies on vehicle keepers to comply with their legal obligations to notify dvla of all relevant changes

4517305 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4517306 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4517307 in heaven there may be some evidence down in the lolo forest because thats where we were

4517312 there are lots of people who have concerns about this application and lots of those people arent against windpower
4517313 we think its quite unacceptable that ecotricitys way round that is to give people window blinds so they can sit in darkened rooms
4517314 were opposing this application because we think its an inappropriate site for a wind farm
4517315 the views across the vale would be changed and id say ruined forever
4517316 the damage to our livelihoods family life and wellbeing need a lot of consideration
4517317 people live in north dorset because of its beauty and peacefulness people holiday in north dorset for that reason too i feel very sad that this could be taken away from us by some giant useless turbines
4517318 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4517319 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4517320 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4517321 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4517322 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4517323 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4517324 if you want to sit there and let it drop like a hot potato then you can live with it
4517325 im trying to do whats best for this community and we need control
4517326 the only thing i can assure is death and taxes
4517327 basically it is mutual consideration as far as malaysia marine and heavy engineering sdn bhd mmhe is concerned this misc unit has an order book of us 4 billion rm13 4 billion to keep it busy for three years
4517328 of course we would like to be able to take in more orders but we are limited in terms of people and space
4517329 there is an opportunity and they ramunia are looking for partners on our side we are always on the lookout for possibilities of new partnerships but the deal is not done yet
4517330 the due diligence will take a long time and we anticipate for it to be completed by next month we had just submitted the first phase of the due diligence to the securities commission as per the normal requirement
4517331 while the due diligence is in progress certain items in regards to liabilities exposure overseas ventures and so on might arise thus it is important that we go through the entire due diligence process first
4517332 for a second opinion i dont see why i cant not go along with this
4517333 i think we should be focusing on our negotiations with the ida
4517334 you will negotiate directly with the developer for what used to be road mitigation
4517335 that doesnt sound like much leverage to me at all
4517336 the bottom line is that we need to reduce our dependence
4517337 there is viable wind in oxford county to realize wind farms
4517338 its not stellar its not the middle of lake erie but its good
4517339 but we have to be careful how we define health issues
4517340 are you going to put one of those in your backyard
4517341 wind turbines should not be built within 1 5 miles of peoples homes people living 1 5 to three miles from a proposed turbine site should be notified of potential health and life quality effects
4517342 if it were underground we would not be as adamantly opposed to it
4517343 if its down four or five feet nobodys going to be bothered by it
4517344 it may not be binding when we deal with the public service commission
4517345 there were enormous complexities and there are some loose ends that we have not nailed down we have figured out most of the solutions however
4517346 weve made enough progress on our system issues to begin shipping from some of our distribution centers today and will continue to work though the night to have shipments available to run all distribution centers tomorrow
4517347 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4517348 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4517349 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing
4517350 what is all of this headache worth if they dont save the school money
4517351 i like what im hearing about the rate of savings per month
4517352 before we can explain these complicated issues to our taxpayers we need to understand them ourselves
4517353 the last piece of the puzzle is to make sure the metering is accurate
4517354 we have a commitment to savings and a commitment to green energy

4517378 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4517379 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4517380 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
4517381 alleged misrepresentations made by wachovia to thousands of its customers about the liquidity risk
4517382 we continue to work with state regulators and others to bring real relief to investors who were not given the forthright information they needed in the process of purchasing auction rate securities
4517383 this agreement in principle with wachovia if approved by the commission will permit tens of thousands of wachovia investors to get their money back
4517384 we understand that unprecedented market conditions have created difficulties for our clients particularly those holding auction rate securities
4517385 we are pleased to announce a comprehensive solution for the liquidity needs of clients who purchased auction rate securities at wachovia and to resolve this matter with federal and state regulators
4517386 todays settlement is a major step towards making these investors whole
4517387 i am pleased that six months of uncertainty and worry is over and that these investors will soon get their money back
4517388 the five settlements together provide relief to thousands of investors who were left holding nearly 35 billion worth of securities they could not sell after the widespread failure of the auction rate securities market this past february
4517389 at the heart of this investigation is the simple goal of returning billions of dollars back into the hands of investors which in turn injects confidence into the entire market
4517390 the industry is now taking responsibility for correcting a problem they helped create and well continue working to make all investors whole
4517391 our main aim is to create awareness through our games by making it a fun process
4517392 we actually dont even communicate that much when working with a japanese publisher but when something happens we can always get in touch with ea and talk about how we both feel on an issue our relationship is extremely good

4517410 not only do you lose the match you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4517411 the olympic is considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4517412 we know when it touches us he knew that thats where it comes into calling it on yourself should i expect him to do that maybe not
4517413 i do not think that this proposal will yield results in short period because the countries of caucasus demonstrate different positions on conflicts
4517414 i shared this idea with my russian and georgian counterparts and obtained positive response from them in this regard
4517415 the idea of realizing caucasian union appears already very difficult precisely now because the equilibrium which ruled in caucasus over decades was broken in favor of russia after the conflict in georgia
4517416 but russia will never wish strengthening the position of turkey in this region
4517417 azerbaijan georgia and turkey support the territorial integrity of the countries but armenia and russia act against these principles this is very serious differences in the positions
4517418 because of the contradiction of position and interests unification of the caucasus countries in the pact is not possible
4517419 creating this union is till impossible from the practical point of view because georgian armenian factors will not make it possible to reach consensus here
4517420 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4517421 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4517422 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4517423 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
4517424 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
4517425 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
4517426 roughly from cameron village and five points north to lynn and spring forest roads
4517427 im not sure theres a need for a new term
4517428 so what then is this new identity that is so increasingly distinct
4517429 between neighborhoods could create pride in community and in the city itself if nothing else perhaps it would allow people to come out of their homes and get to know their neighbors and then develop solidarity
4517430 the quality of life in our city depends upon the quality of our neighborhoods
4517431 the importance of our neighborhoods and participation of our citizenry has been further underscored by celebrating our neighborhoods during the month of september annually the mayor issues a proclamation designating september as neighborhoods month the city took the leadership and instituted an annual neighborhood exchange
4517432 in addition we would like to have outdoor activities on a separate weekend celebrating individual neighborhoods these outdoor activities could consist of a parade tours of neighborhoods and a closing picnic or the hosting of a picnic in individual neighborhoods for those touring that particular community

4517436 it makes you wonder why did apple decide to launch a brand new phone a major software update the iphone app store and a new web service all on the same day i suppose the company thought it would make a big splash and it did but it was caused by a belly flop
4517437 i can play in the centre or on the wing during my career ive played behind one or two strikers or on the left or the right
4517438 this is a very special young man with the potential of becoming one of the great goalkeepers in the international game
4517439 i felt a good feeling in my body right away
4517440 then i met gary megson and there was even more positive energy coming into me
4517441 i think chelseas current right back paulo ferreira is a better player
4517442 hes a big guy in stature and ability so i think everybody will enjoy watching him play
4517443 yes im a runner but i like to run with the ball
4517444 i cannot tell you how excited i am to be joining newcastle united
4517445 if he continues to progress as we hope he will become an even more magnificent player than he is now
4517446 weve got a very talented young footballer who is eager to prove his qualities at the highest level
4517447 valon is a good player technically potent going forward and has the physical attributes to adapt quickly to the premier league
4517448 several other big clubs were interested in him and it is credit to our technical director gianluca nani that he has brought him to west ham
4517449 ive come to england to score goals thats what i do
4517450 look i am not an apologist for chinas environmental record its record and legacy are a traumatic one
4517451 but we have all seen the efforts being made at these olympics and they hold promise a bit less judgment for what chinas progressive leaders are trying to do might be appropriate at this stage
4517452 china did not start planting trees at the olympics that began 20 years ago now it is one of the only asian countries where forest cover is increasing the chinese have proven to themselves they are capable of far reaching innovation
4517453 china has some of the worst environmental problems in the world but it is paying more attention to both pollution and degradation they realise environmental degradation affects economic development
4517454 this should give the reformers and progressive environmental groups in the government far greater possibility for influence
4517455 people in beijing are not going to forget that the air can be cleaner
4517456 i have based my assessment on the empirical evidence i have no reason to doubt that the numbers are genuine
4517457 ive been to beijing a lot and walked outside so i felt the difference and subjectively if you compare it to an average day in nairobi you can taste more sulphur in the air there
4517458 i see china accelerating environmental efforts much more than other developing nations

4517566 why suddenly is there greater demand for a drug for attentional problems
4517567 this might and i stress might be something to do with the increased exposure of young children to unsupervised and lengthy hours in front of a screen
4517568 could it be and this is just a suggestion which i think we should look into could it be if a small child is sitting in front of a screen pressing buttons and getting reactions quickly for many hours they get used to and their brains get used to rapid responses
4517569 could it be that they then have to sit still for half an hour and of course theyre not used to that because theyre used to the rapid interaction with the screen and could it again a question be that they are fidgety and hyperactive and then diagnosed as having a disorder
4517570 what we need to question is this are we putting people into the optimum environment how can we create an environment which will pre dispose the brain to react in ways we consider ideal

4517576 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4517577 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4517578 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4517629 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4517630 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4517631 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4517632 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4517633 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4517634 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili

4517637 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4517651 although the complex challenges associated with the presence of day laborers are not specific to one industry nor one company the home depot recognizes that some of our stores in the city of los angeles are impacted

4517659 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4517660 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4517661 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4517662 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries

4517704 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4517705 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
4517706 we are pleased to be recognized by ses for our work in delivering consumers the most relevant local search results
4517707 this nomination is accepted on behalf of our engineering team who are dedicated to the advancement of local search technologies
4517708 the home of the literature we have spent so much time learning and loving
4517709 we are on track to becoming one of the top destination sites in asia

4517711 assuming the consummation of a final agreement i would anticipate that the 50 50 sharing arrangement may result in annual revenue between 100 million and 150 million for all asia once the system is rolled out across china
4517712 but a culture based on evolution is one that would naturally embrace survival of the fittest and the extreme of that thinking is that if i can increase my chances of survival or improve my living by killing you then i am justified
4517713 the bible tells us how to go to heaven not how the heavens go
4517714 look at my finery see the beautiful embroidery on my vest
4517715 i want to talk about these beautiful clothes this embroidered vest has to be more beautiful than anything ever seen by man
4517716 look we can see your belly we can see your chest hair there is no vest
4517717 i can see your belly too look theres an appendectomy scar
4517718 i can see your big ass youre not wearing anything
4517719 youre not being fair i cant answer all these objections at once i wanted to talk about my beautiful embroidered vest but since youre bringing up all this irrelevant stuff i guess ill just leave
4517720 ill get back to you later when im not so busy
4517721 but a culture based on evolution is one that would naturally embrace survival of the fittest and the extreme of that thinking is that if i can increase my chances of survival or improve my living by killing you then i am justified
4517722 but a culture based on magnetism ia one that would naturally embrace the attraction of opposites and the extreme of that thinking is that if i find someone with tastes and interests similar to my own i should repell them and seek out and live with my opposite someone with whom i have nothing in common
4517723 but when you get such astonishing statistics as that an african american male who attends church has a life expectancy 11 years greater than one who does not there are only two explanations either god looks after his own or church attendance makes it much easier to avoid self destructive behaviour
4517724 evolution hasnt called me just to say hello in the last month
4517725 the criterion of costly commitment rules out cognitive theories of religion as inadequate however insightful they may be cognitive theories attempt to explain religious belief and practice as cultural manipulations of ordinary psychological processes of categorization reasoning and remembering they do not account for the emotional involvement that leads people to sacrifice to others what is dear to themselves including labor limb and life such theories are often short on motive and are unable to distinguish mickey mouse from moses cartoon fantasy from religious belief they fail to tell us why in general the greater the sacrifice as in abraham offering up his beloved son the more others trust in ones religious commitment
4517726 scott atran suggests that religion doesnt simply happen to be counterfactual the point of it is to be so because belief in counterfactuals is good proof of a strong commitment to group norms
4517727 first of all what is fundamentalism the word itself was coined in the early twentieth century and applied to a particular brand of protestantism it comes from a determination to protect what were called in foundational manifestos the five fundamentals of christian belief particularly the inerrancy of scripture scripture cant make a mistake right it has to be read literally this was a counterattack against so called liberal religions embrace of the insights of the enlightenment and the scientific age can you apply normal standards of historical criticism to religious belief the fundamentalists said no because normal standards might lead you to understand texts as having been composed in normal human circumstances instead of inspired by god so when you read the gospel accounts of the birth of jesus through the lens of historical critical method you may conclude that the three kings never actually traveled to bethlehem that its a mythical story created to make a point a genre that the people who wrote it were comfortable with fundamentalists reacted against any mitigating of the literal fact of the three kings to read texts for their theological meaning rather than for their historical literalness would undercut the whole affirmation of the religion the next thing youd be saying that jesus didnt rise from the dead on the third day and if that didnt happen where are you
4517728 the point here is that the initial city on a hill impulse has never stopped being part of our self understanding the idea of america as having a mission to the world or in biblical terms a mission to the gentiles
4517729 evolution is not our friend its a mindless horribly wasteful process one that doesnt care if humans as a species live or die
4517730 nature mr alnut is what we are put in this world to rise above
4517731 until you look at the eye movements of novice goaltenders who scatter their gaze all over the place and have a much lower save percentage than the elite goalies
4517732 goalies often focus on physical things like improving technique but they over look the decision making the cognitive side of things
4517733 i think this study shows that you also need to focus on your decision making and your thinking processes having optimal focus is just as important as being in optimal physical shape
4517734 so as per my usual laziness im not even going to read the source article and make wide sweeping generalization about the conclusions presented in this news article
4517735 consumers are clearly feeling the effects of a perfect storm of challenging economic events such as the mortgage crisis stock market volatility and rising energy costs
4517736 the acquisition of b n dicta fits perfectly into heinzs global strategy to focus its portfolio on three attractive core categories ketchup amp sauces infant nutrition and meals amp snacks including baked beans soups and pasta meals b n dicta will strengthen heinzs sauces business in france and we have exciting plans for the business
4517737 we believe that at current price levels agrias adss are an attractive investment for the company
4517738 the last 10 years have seen a three fold increase in the prescription of the drug ritalin a drug used for attention deficit disorder one asks why
4517739 why suddenly is there greater demand for a drug for attentional problems
4517740 this might and i stress might be something to do with the increased exposure of young children to unsupervised and lengthy hours in front of a screen
4517741 could it be and this is just a suggestion which i think we should look into could it be if a small child is sitting in front of a screen pressing buttons and getting reactions quickly for many hours they get used to and their brains get used to rapid responses
4517742 could it be that they then have to sit still for half an hour and of course theyre not used to that because theyre used to the rapid interaction with the screen and could it again a question be that they are fidgety and hyperactive and then diagnosed as having a disorder
4517743 what we need to question is this are we putting people into the optimum environment how can we create an environment which will pre dispose the brain to react in ways we consider ideal
4517744 the technology is creating an environment that is answer rich but were question poor
4517745 deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
4517746 social security number student id number home address phone number and contact information
4517747 we take this seriously and as a district we are very careful to protect student information
4517748 theres no reason for them to have social security numbers there when they use the student id number for everything
4517749 long term care providers understand the intricate challenges involved in establishing an efficient workforce model and river oaks is no exception
4517750 maintaining appropriate staffing levels controlling labor costs and ensuring staff have the proper qualifications to provide quality service are all keys to successful growth of any healthcare organization
4517751 see my life before this was real i wasnt imagining it
4517752 when francis schaeffer first appeared on the american scene in 1965 evangelicals hardly knew what to make of him he was 53 years old his christian faith had been formed in the furnace of the fundamentalist modernist controversies of the 1930s and he was a card carrying member of the impeccably fundamentalist bible presbyterian church he defended passionately the idea of the inerrancy of scripture a doctrine that had already seen some slippage in evangelical circles yet this was no ordinary fundamentalist preacher he and his wife edith had lived for ten years in a student commune they had started in the swiss alps yet this was no ordinary fundamentalist preacher he and his wife edith had lived for ten years in a student commune they had started in the swiss alps when he lectured he wore an alpine hiking outfit knickers knee socks walking shoes by 1972 he had added to his already singular appearance long hair and a white tufted beard most curious of all he seldom quoted from the bible he was more apt to talk about the philosophical importance of henry miller then regarded as the most pornographic writer in american letters during the next two decades the schaeffers organized a multiple thrust ministry that reshaped american evangelicalism perhaps no intellectual save c s lewis affected the thinking of evangelicals more profoundly perhaps no leader of the period save billy graham left a deeper stamp on the movement as a whole together the schaeffers gave currency to the idea of intentional christian community prodded evangelicals out of their cultural ghetto inspired an army of evangelicals to become serious scholars encouraged women who chose roles as mothers and homemakers mentored the leaders of the new christian right and solidified popular evangelical opposition to abortion
4517753 francis schaeffer the last great modern theologian and the reason why i have a goatee
4517754 is there any doctor there who can look at bens eye and write a prescription for eye drops this has gotten significantly worse in the last few hours it is oozing green gunk and extremely red

4517756 except the judicial decision making all other activities of administration and the persons included in it judiciary are subject to rti act
4517757 it is more so since the judiciary is having a dual role as i administrative function and ii judicial decision making
4517758 guilty of improper exercise of judicial functions the cumulative effect of which was to lower the dignity of his office and undermine the confidence of the public in the administration of justice
4517759 the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of india
4517760 indeed justice ramaswami had made it clear to the chief justice that he did not recognise any such jurisdiction in any body or authority
4517761 were un biased or were above board amp have presented an accurate report queries to supreme court parliament of india amp central government
4517762 supreme court is filled with fera violators amp bride burners
4517763 air 1988 sc 1208 when chief justice of india justice e s venkataramaiaha admits that
4517764 in every high court there are 3 4 judges who are out every evening to party in foreign embassiies or at advocates places drink dine
4517765 while the death penalty continues to be used in india there remains a danger that it will be used disproportionately against ethnic minorities the poor or other disadvantaged groups there is only one way to ensure such inequalities in the administration of justice do not occur the complete abolition of the death penalty
4517766 or it can continue to hang death row inmates when the judicial system that puts them there has been shown by this extensive research to be unfair
4517767 experience shows that an impression is created in the public however unjustified it may be that it would be advantageous to engage a judges son as an advocate
4517768 it was generally believed that a b c and d all judges constituted a mutual co operative society in the sense was believed that each of the four judges a b c and d would protect the sons of the three other judges
4517769 some relatives misuse their connections more blatantly than others but the problem remains in principle an especially acute feature of problem of nepotism as it exists here is that apart from relatives of high court judges children of sitting supreme court judges from this region also practise here at chandigarh
4517770 the advantages the benefits that accrue to them from their connections is well known to all and is fully exploited
4517771 there are complaints from all over the country that judges children are practising in the same high court and that is causing grave problem in regard to handling of cases and the judges favouring and one judges son appearing before another judge
4517772 close association with individual members of the bar particularly with those who practise in the same court shall be eschewed
4517773 if your son brother or sister is practising in the same court you cant eschew close association with your son daughter or brother
4517774 therefore you should not be a judge in the same court you should opt to be transferred to some other court where a close relative is not practising
4517775 that instances have come that a relation of a judge having joined only three four years in the practise suddenly his briefs are huge in number so that is what it is under scrutiny because he takes advantage of his position
4517776 it is very clear also as i know personally so many judges in the high courts their children are practising and are being pampered also
4517777 does this approach with people usually work for you because i gotta tell you it aint working for me
4517778 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4517779 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4517780 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4517781 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4517782 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4517783 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4517784 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4517785 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4517786 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4517787 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4517788 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do

4517810 music can have influences on the breathing rate e g via emotional effects such an increased arousal which will alter oxygen levels in the blood or relaxing effects so that fewer muscles consume oxygen which also increases oxygen levels

4517812 duration of the effect is not certain from seconds to minutes

4517857 the most important service we can give our brothers and sisters is the clear and humble proclamation of jesus christ who came to this world that we might have life and have it in abundance
4517858 amidst the difficulties of a sometimes hostile environment from the lack of immediate and spectacular results or faced with the insufficiency of human means i invite you not to be overcome by fear weighed down by discouragement or dragged along by inertia
4517859 the present time is a providential occasion for listening again with simplicity purity of heart and fidelity to how christ reminds us that we are not servants but friends
4517860 he instructs us in order that we might remain in his love without molding ourselves to the messages of this world let us not be deaf to his word let us learn from him let us imitate his way of life let us be sowers of the word in this way with all of our lives with the joy of knowing we are loved by jesus who we can call brother we will be valid instruments for him to continue drawing everyone to himself with the mercy that flows from his cross
4517861 to share this treasure with others as there is no greater treasure than to enjoy the friendship of christ and walk by his side consecrating our greatest energies to this beautiful labor is worth it knowing that divine grace precedes sustains and accompanies us in carrying it out
4517862 may you find therefore in persevering prayer in the fervent meditation of the word of god in the obedience to the magisterium of the church in the dignified celebration of the sacraments and in the testimony of fraternal charity the strength necessary to identify with the sentiments of christ you will be his disciples with coherence and generosity proclaiming with your own examples that christ is the son of god the redeemer of man and the firm rock upon which we cement our existence
4517863 the consolation of christ and to offer his love to those in tribulation to those who are weighed down by suffering and have been wounded by the coldness of indifferentism or the scourge of corruption these challenges demand we overcome individualism and isolation and that we strengthen the sense of belonging to the church and the loyal collaboration with her pastors in order to form christian communities that are prayerful unified fraternal and missionary
4517864 for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
4517865 i only knew that the israeli army had arrested my father repeatedly and for me he was everything a good loving man who would do anything for me he took care of us bought us gifts gave of himself whereas the soldiers entered our house and took him away from me
4517866 their leaders in prison received better conditions such as the best food as well as more family visits and towels for the shower these people have no morals they have no integrity
4517867 i was very enthusiastic about what i heard i began to read the bible every day and i continued with religion lessons i did it in secret of course i used to travel to the ramallah hills to places like the al tira neighborhood and to sit there quietly with the amazing landscape and read the bible
4517868 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
4517869 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one
4517870 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith
4517871 i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god
4517872 admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
4517873 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
4517874 theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east
4517875 many people will hate me for this interview but im telling them that i love all of them even those who hate me
4517876 i invite all the people including the terrorists among them to open their hearts and believe

4517900 hace dos d as que llegamos a este campamento mi hija de ocho a os sigue con su abuela en nuestra aldea loi sam de donde huimos por el bombardeo del ej rcito
4517901 cuando nos fuimos mi hija gul zari ten a fuertes dolores abdominales
4517902 unas 12 000 familias escaparon de la agencia bajaur donde residen 900 000 personas
4517903 la gente no s lo huye hacia bajo y alto dir sino tambi n a las ciudades de peshawar mardan y charsadda

4517907 jamil estaba jugando en el patio de la casa cuando cay la bomba encontramos su cuerpo hecho pedazos
4517908 qu dios destruya al talib n y al ej rcito los responsables de la muerte de mi hijo
4517909 m s de 400 familias llegaron a peshawar buscan casas para alquilar pero no consiguen nada por el alto precio
4517910 caminamos varias horas con mi mujer y los ni os no pudimos encontrar ning n transporte
4517911 but what she cannot do is betray the message in order adapt it to society
4517912 the truth is always the truth there are some things that cannot change because they are things man has received revealed by god in jesus christ
4517913 history and the present moment must adapt to the truth and not vice versa
4517914 i have never had that thought the lord has given me the gift of a profound love for the church
4517915 i always say that if i could be born again i would be a priest
4517916 the greatest moment of my day is celebrating the eucharist and in the name of jesus christ forgiving sins
4517917 since i have been a priest i havent had one minute for myself im very happy being priest
4517918 convinced that the desire of the pope and the sense of the church is that priests should dress as clergy
4517919 a world that is so secularized where more than ever they want to take god out of everything we should dress as to make present the mystery of god
4517920 there are more young people in the church now than ever young people are falling in love with jesus christ and encountering the mystery of the cross in order to confront suffering jesus saves them from the death of sin
4517921 pois dizem que 1 de desconto nos seus soldos mensais muito para os magros sal rios que t m preferindo assim cortar as suas contribui es ao sindicato

4517924 ive seen someone pick up the phone and beat someone over the head with it

4517926 rage can be avoided when workers can talk about whats wrong in the office
4517927 det r om jligt att inte tro det du ser men det r lika om jligt att se det du inte tror
4517928 i really have to go but i dont want to miss anything too bad this film is longer than roots
4517929 the person who says well im going to put my faith on the shelf and not let it affect my decisions as president is either lying or theyre ignorant
4517930 im going to ask them about abortion i am going to ask them about the definition of marriage
4517931 i intend to ask the tough questions but i am going to ask them in a civil way
4517932 im certainly going to ask a question about jesus christ in this forum
4517933 theyre going to come out take a picture together thats the picture everybody wants
4517934 every one of those 40 million children are in heaven now the people who had those abortions are not guaranteed heaven now where would you have an evangelist spend most of his time winning the people to christ who need forgiveness or worrying about all those children who are in heaven because they are safe
4517935 we have to go back to what evangelicals have been for 2 000 years
4517936 i want to raise the personal responsibility in peoples lives
4517937 i want to raise that level of civility in our society and i want to raise the level of credibility in the church that the church is not known simply for what were against
4517938 god said yeah all this stuff youre doing is good
4517939 the bible tells us that jesus christ went into every village preaching teaching and healing one third of jesus ministry was health care he cared about the sick he was a healer
4517940 cause thats where the church needs to be in the heart of darkness we need to be holding up the light of christ holding up the cross where everybody else is afraid to go
4517941 the problem is we dont have the right to demonize people just because we disagree with them we dont have a right to destroy their character or reputation just because we disagree
4517942 im not a religious left because i dont believe in big government im not secular left im not religious right and im not secular right
4517943 i happen to be in the kingdom of god my kingdom is not of this world
4517944 we are members of the body of christ christ shed his blood for us were going to live in heaven together
4517945 and yet if you dont hold the party line all of a sudden for these people politics trumps faith and sometimes when people dont understand that they want you to be on their political bandwagon
4517946 you cannot change lives simply through laws thats what the book of galatians teaches so i dont have that much faith in politics
4517947 politicians come and go no matter who gets elected in four or eight years theyll be out
4517948 neither of these men are the next savior of the world theyre both flawed individuals and theyre both going to need god
4517949 i got two for me and one for a friend we love them
4517950 the r r garbage bowl is great its deep light weight and is such a handy tool to have in the kitchen even tho i have lots of other bowl that i could use its so nice to have a specific one that i use just for its purpose
4517951 i used to use anything i could get my hands on but now i feel so important because i have the real deal a garbage bowl
4517952 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4517953 american politicians who find the source of money after its given to them troubling they find out something they didnt know afterwards frequently will and hopefully i think always at least frequently will return that money will say they disagree with the source of the money hopefully all of us will do that but whether or not we all live up to that standard you clearly do not adopt that as a standard for contributions to mariams appeal
4517954 with the rest of the world now joining the u s in slowing down the prospects for holding the dollar have brightened considerably
4517955 the current global food crisis requires immediate action to feed people most at risk
4517956 since agriculture and the needs of small scale farmers in the developing world have been increasingly neglected in recent decades we need a significant reinvestment in agricultural development from donors and developing countries that focuses on helping small farmers boost their yields and increase their incomes
4517957 has a false fake birth certificate posted on their website
4517958 has a false fake birth certificate posted on their website
4517959 the campaign has a false fake birth certificate posted on their website the original birth certificate of obama has never been released and the campaign refuses to release it
4517960 well couldnt it just be a state of hawaii produced duplicate
4517961 no its a theres been good analysis of it on the internet and its been shown to have watermarks from photoshop its a fake document thats on the website right now
4517962 responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
4517963 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
4517964 and whether it shows through depends on how much force was put into it
4517965 potentially if you have that number you could break into the system
4517966 to see if they could try and resolve the issue with the people who were asking questions
4517967 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
4517968 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
4517969 there is not one shred of evidence to disprove politifacts conclusion that the candidates name is barack hussein obama or to support allegations that the birth certificate he released isnt authentic and thats true no matter how many people cling to some hint of doubt and use the internet to fuel their innate sense of distrust
4517970 it kind of reminds me of vladimir putin invading georgia
4517971 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4517972 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4517973 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4517974 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4517975 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4517976 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4517977 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4517978 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4517979 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4517980 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4517981 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4517982 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4517983 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4517984 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4517985 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4517986 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4517987 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4517988 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4517989 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4517990 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4517991 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4517992 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4517993 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4517994 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4517995 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4517996 deserve a voice because they are what the paper is all about the community
4517997 yes there are a lot of details to work out
4517998 yes a petition might be ignored yes its unclear whether some of zells lieutenants can even read whats the alternative dry eyed skeptic we can sit at our desks and read or we can try to act in every way we can to save the newspaper
4517999 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4518000 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4518001 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4518016 this project nearly four months in the making has been enlightening for our writers and editors and no doubt for those who contributed comments and essays

4518018 the secretary of defense shall grant access to accredited members of the media at military commemoration ceremonies and memorial services conducted by the armed forces for members of the armed forces who have died on active duty and when the remains of members of the armed forces arrive at military installations in the united states
4518019 we are painfully aware that the department of defense currently prohibits media coverage of these somber ceremonies which in turn bars the public from those images as well
4518020 there will be no arrival ceremonies for or media coverage of deceased military personnel returning or departing from ramstein air base or dover air force base
4518021 we are thrilled to partner with the green river chamber of commerce during the 7th annual river festival to educate the public about john wesley powell and his magnificent exploits
4518022 now people all over north america will have the privilege of seeing and learning more about the expeditions into the american west major powell and his voyagers now can be seen everywhere as they explore with u haul across north america on the sides of 2 200 moving vans
4518023 the river festival is a celebration of the many things we do on and around the river
4518024 the chamber and the river festival committee are very excited to include the unveiling of the supergraphic with john wesley powell as part of those festivities powell was one of those extraordinary people who helped shape not just green river but the entire country and it all began here

4518065 es ist f r mich in keinster weise nachvollziehbar aber wir werden es akzeptieren und uns dadurch nicht aus der fassung bringen lassen
4518066 es liegt mir fern schiedsrichterleistungen zu kommentieren aber was herr gagelmann an den dfb gemeldet hat entspricht absolut nicht den tatsachen das ist auch durch die betrachtung der fernsehbilder nochmals deutlich geworden

4518070 but i always go to the locations when i write a novel in this case some of the locations were so impressive that the idea for the film came frm that i enjoyed the preparation of the movie i mean the period immediately before the shooting when you choose everything all the details when you create the world
4518071 as a curator one of the things i most enjoyed about organizing iconicity was the opportunity to work with a really diverse range of artists and images as the show includes art that spans nearly 2 000 years from china japan taiwan korea vietnam india russia and the u s
4518072 while many if not most of the exhibitions in our galleries are devoted to specific geographical regions and historical periods the thematic approach of iconicity makes it possible to bring together works of art that would rarely be seen together and the resulting juxtapositions are exciting both visually and conceptually
4518073 permanent joy for all of the little at pajamas notes that pomo english profs are making solzhenitsyn disappear apparently he did not toe some party line or something its a sad piece to read a quote
4518074 because the story answers to most of the myths and preconceptions westerners already have about soviet life the problem will be to make sure that students read it with the same degree of resistance with which they would normally confront any other piece of fiction

4518079 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4518080 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4518081 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution

4518083 like z it describes all structures in space and time with a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions
4518084 the whole point of vacation bible school is to lead the children youth and adults who attend to a saving knowledge of jesus christ bottom line thats it
4518085 the fun the games and the music are the means to getting the opportunity to talk with the children and their families and share the gospel with them
4518086 last year 90 percent of the people who turned in evaluation forms from the vbs preview events indicated they needed help with follow up
4518087 we honestly had no idea the need was that great
4518088 it is startling to realize that in vacation bible school in 2006 we documented 94 980 decisions to accept christ
4518089 that is 1 1 decision for every one person trained as a vbs worker by our state conventions that is phenomenal when you consider that statistically sbc wide it takes 44 people to win one person to christ
4518090 these numbers are just the ones we know about that we have documentation about
4518091 i can only imagine how many more people are reached when you think about the parents brothers sisters grandparents and friends of these children
4518092 i actually have had churches that proudly showed me stacks of bundled vbs cards from several years
4518093 they dont even seem to realize they are just bundles of missed opportunities
4518094 like z it describes all structures in space and time with a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions

4518102 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4518103 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4518104 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4518105 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4518106 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4518118 na praia durante o ver o o uso da saia por homens passa mais despercebido mas sempre estamos vestidos de maneira s bria n o estamos fantasiados
4518119 ainda estamos muito longe desse momento em que os homens poderiam utilizar saias no trabalho n o h como fazer isso hoje
4518120 esse um dos grandes problemas enfrentados por membros da associa o muitas vezes dif cil que a pr pria fam lia aceite isso e o fato de usarmos saias pode ser utilizado contra n s na justi a em processos de div rcio e guarda dos filhos
4518121 after russias invasion of georgia what now for the west
4518122 w hen people are universally ignorant and debauched in their manners they will sink under their own weight without the aid of foreign invaders
4518123 they dont want to rebuild the soviet union but they do want a sphere of influence
4518124 i think this was aimed much more to the west more to ukraine central asia and the other caucasus states
4518125 i worry that any country in the region such as ukraine that has been tilting towards the u s may now think twice they may lean back a bit toward russia
4518126 for 3 1 2 centuries russia has dominated its neighborhood
4518127 throwing a gantlet down saying that there isnt going to be any more nato enlargement
4518128 i think that american officials and analysts and i would put myself in this boat underestimated the scope of the russian reaction to kosovos separation from serbia
4518129 the russians at the time said that they may well retaliate by stirring up trouble in abkhazia and south ossetia and i think many people said well thats going to be mostly talk in fact theyve gone ahead and done it
4518130 is demonstrating to the rest of the world that the united states is not the sole superpower any more or if it is its so stretched that its not going to come to your aid
4518131 that weakens the u s position globally quite a bit
4518132 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4518133 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4518134 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4518135 non ti deve interessare quello che ho io fatti gli affari tuoi che io da oggi in poi non voglio pi sapere niente di nessuno

4518141 i dont think rangers have got the money to afford mcfadden to be honest
4518142 abdoulaye is a fantastic player with top flight experience in abundance
4518143 we have worked extremely hard to conclude the deal and we are absolutely delighted to have signed a player of his quality
4518144 so far for me its been a case of taking two steps forward and one back
4518145 the season before last was very good but im honest to say that last season wasnt good enough for me i was not happy with that the last third was okay i got some goals and was starting to get back to old ways
4518146 its going to be a long season and there needs to be plenty of hard work but i am very positive about what is to come
4518147 everybody keeps talking about hull being the favourites for relegation but i think there are 10 teams that fall into that category
4518148 we saw that last season not many people thought that reading and birmingham would go down its all media speculation at this stage
4518149 were very pleased that were at home first the big question is how quickly we gel together
4518150 individually we are all good players but that will not win you the game as a team i believe we have a very big chance to beat fulham
4518151 i know the importance of the first game of the season ive been playing long enough to know that if you win the first game it gives you a lot of confidence

4518181 its the best part of a very special year for the phinney family
4518182 my health has been a distraction and a concern for the whole family for a long time and for once i feel like now we can just let the kids also daughter kelsey 13 flourish and especially taylor

4518188 but ive only been doing this for a year im just savoring the experience instead of worrying about it
4518189 hopefully its the beginning of a new era for him hopefully as he gets better he can come to more my events and be there cheering for me the future is bright
4518190 i was worried about just being able to weather living in my own body for another year or two years or five years

4518372 star wars potentially is a welcome trek for hard core fans it will be a mixed thrill given that the saga returns to the big screen as a cartoon
4518373 clone wars isnt much of a leap the somber tone of those three movies chronicling the downfall of anakin skywalker from snotty brooding teen to blackhearted darth vader is gone replaced with a variation of the campy humor and camaraderie that characterized the original trilogy

4518453 we had this game circled ever since it came out
4518454 a few of us felt like we needed this game to show we mean business and are serious about the gold medal
4518455 i had a lady cry when she came up to me
4518456 she came up to me asked me for an autograph and as i started to sign it she started crying literally crying i couldnt believe that i felt like the pope for a minute i just play basketball

4518465 we competed in two events and came home with two medals each
4518466 well i wish it would have been two golds for me but based on our individual results there is a lot more pressure on us i think we were feeling that today we werent really prepared for ukraine but we were ready for this match against france
4518467 i usually dont take naps but i felt that i wasnt really awake during the semis
4518468 i felt like maybe if i could go to sleep wake up and start over it would work for me
4518469 all the advances theyve made are really positive for our sport
4518470 with the wireless and the lights in the mask it makes it a lot cooler to watch and to be able to see peoples expressions when the camera is on them makes it more interesting
4518471 and on television theyre able to show it in slow motion which also helps because it moves so fast when its in real time they can see the action a lot better
4518472 i thought this was our absolute best shot to get it our team has never been stronger
4518473 we had an incredible season and to not fence up to our potential was so disappointing to me

4518482 we had an incredible season and to not fence up to our potential was so disappointing to me
4518483 but i know that a lot of people back home are paying more attention watching tv and getting on the internet looking for updates even at the crazy hours that this is happening back home and thats really a good thing for the future of fencing in this country
4518484 we dont try to send messages we just play basketball
4518485 it was chris bosh i thought he was phenomenal he got so many deflections he got a lot of blocked shots scored a lot of points and he got a lot of rebounds he was a presence out there
4518486 nobody could believe this the greek team made the americans kneel to them
4518487 it really means a lot to us we wanted to keep the pressure on them we wanted to kind of redeem ourselves this was like a payback game for us

4518495 it was one of the goals of the season for me to do well here so obviously the quarterfinals is not going to do it for me i think james played well he went full out and hit everything he needed ive played him on many occasions but i think this was the best ive seen him im happy for him hes a good guy i hope he can go all the way now
4518496 i wish i could have done much more but ive still got to look forward i look forward to the u s open and then the masters cup in shanghai try to save my season this obviously is a big blow but at the same time i know the danger of bestofthree set matches theyre over in a hurry you could feel that today i was down 64 3love in no time i guess thats a danger in these kind of competitions

4518533 behind the scenes government interference with media freedom and editorial independence
4518534 the price of silence the growing threat of soft censorship in latin america
4518535 until a few years ago serious interference predominated in the region like persecution direct censorship or even murders of journalists
4518536 now these forms of interference are on the decline fortunately although more subtle and less visible but equally harmful practices have cropped up
4518537 we cannot say the criterion we used was to study the worst cases no not all
4518538 governments across the region routinely use advertising contracts to reward or punish media outlets for their content
4518539 government officials who commit such abuses rarely violate the letter of domestic law
4518540 there are no laws in the countries we studied that specifically prohibit discrimination based on media viewpoint
4518541 centralisation of decision making in political appointees lends itself to politically motivated abuses of government advertising
4518542 the government tries to give you an advertising contract so that you shut your mouth the criterion the government uses is the journalists or medias silence here they dont purchase the ad they buy your conscience your vision as a journalist
4518543 we found that the practice of soliciting advertising contracts from government officials is very widespread
4518544 in argentina the national government often makes generous advertising payments to journalists who write in influential national print media but have radio or cable television programmes with low ratings
4518545 made consistent and suspiciously high allocations to the economic newspaper la rep blica which is generally supportive of government policies and not a top circulation publication
4518546 a highly disproportionate share of government advertising that cannot be justified by the papers circulation or any other competitive advantages
4518547 it is very common to receive phone calls from government officials even at ones home and at any hour this happens in all the media and at all levels
4518548 although editorial pressures have diminished under the current leftwing administration senior uruguayan officials have called media directors to influence the content of what they publish especially directors of media that are relatively less critical of the current administration
4518549 triggers waves of self censorship that chill entire newsrooms and are capable of silencing even the most courageous reporters
4518550 a public and enforceable commitment at all levels of government to refrain from using advertising and other financial or indirect pressures to interfere with media freedom and independence
4518551 thousands of people doing the same thing at exactly the same time

4518598 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4518599 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected

4518611 there will be rejoicing today as chefs hear the news that they are allowed to serve this delicacy again id like to commend the chicago city council for giving this decision the consideration it deserved and coming to a logical conclusion

4518613 did they still worship jesus was there a faithful remnant proclaiming the good news of salvation through jesus christ

4518630 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4518631 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4518632 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4518633 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4518634 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4518635 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4518636 if im 100 sure about it i will give it but im not sure im just moving thats all
4518637 sigh i wish this all would be over and stalking certainly would not do it

4518660 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4518661 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4518662 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4518663 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but the strategic potential of russia
4518664 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values
4518665 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere

4518670 voted for at least two pro legalization of marijuana bills
4518671 do you support keeping drug possession dealing and trafficking a crime
4518672 it appalls me at the thought that people would be na ve enough to vote for someone who admits drug use
4518673 watching parents wail and cry and talk about the hell their families went through
4518674 i would never vote for an elected official who was ever a drug user
4518675 we have to get this country back to being an honorable nation with honorable people running it
4518676 we worked long and hard to close those drug paraphernalia shops in the 1980s and long and hard again to get student drug testing in the schools so we could get drugs out of the schools
4518677 and were going to allow someone to come in to the white house of the united states of america who was a drug user

4518688 i think it was surprising to me that a high ranking if not the highest ranking member of senator clintons team would be engaged in business activities and lobbying that was directly contrary to the position senator clinton had taken
4518689 let me put it this way im not surprised that senator clinton found herself in an uncomfortable position as a consequence and i know that if staff of mine were putting me in that kind of position i would get rid of them
4518690 oh dont worry about it then just do it until tomorrow
4518691 democrats win the state when they hold down gop margins in rural districts and appeal to swing women voters in larimer county and the denver suburbs mr obama lacks rural credentials but he might make inroads in the suburbs mccain needs to run up votes in the gop strongholds of el paso colorado springs douglas south of denver weld eastern plains and mesa western slope counties while appealing to democratic and independent hispanics and catholics

4518701 we were up in the air and two guys who were surprisingly a lot older than us started fights
4518702 then we had to be redirected to venice for a couple of hours the police came on and had to get them off
4518703 they had a couple of drinks on them they were extremely aggressive one of the guys half way through the flight stood up and started smashing the overhead compartments there were loads of girls and a couple of children and i think some people felt a bit threatened
4518704 the captain then made the decision for the safety of all on board to divert to venice where the aircraft was met by members of the italian police
4518705 electro glass is a highly respected company known for its honesty

4518708 i do not mean to imply that most wall street analysts typically receive payola for touting particular stocks
4518709 never to get lost is not to live not to know how to get lost brings you to destruction and somewhere in the terra incognita in between lies a life of discovery
4518710 give give give what is the point of having experience knowledge or talent if i dont give it away of having stories if i dont tell them to others of having wealth if i dont share it i dont intend to be cremated with any of it it is in giving that i connect with others with the world and with the divine
4518711 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive

4518715 mathematics arises when the subject of two ness which results from the passage of time is abstracted from all special occurrences the remaining empty form the relation of n to n 1 of the common content of all these two nesses becomes the original intuition of mathematics and repeated unlimitedly creates new mathematical subjects
4518716 life of mankind as a whole is an arrogant tearing up and devouring of its nest on this pure earth messing up its mothering growth gnawing and mutilating her and making her rich creative power sterile until all life has been swallowed up and the human cancer has withered on the barren planet

4518718 it was time to return to the great mother of us all not with a project or a program but with a barely spoken prayer that she cleanse me of my confusion i called it re search which to me meant to look again for the source of the knowledge the knowledge that had been obliterated by too many ideas too much reading and talking and not enough listening and silence

4518723 if you look at the current state of british athletics it is going to need a small miracle america can produce 10 great new athletes a year nine of them might go to american football but the 10th will probably still beat most european athletes the americans wont be quaking that ive run 60m in 6 55 next year in the indoor world championships theyll probably have three athletes running under 6 50 so in that sense we might need a miracle
4518724 60m is not my best distance im much more suited to the 100m and ill be 25 in 2012 which is the perfect age for a sprinter so who knows

4518732 to be a great leader is not for the fainthearted
4518733 in each moment of each day you have the opportunity to practice to make a positive difference in the lives of those around you he says
4518734 the secret to success is to love what you do so you make the effort to practice and love those you work with so you can help them develop into the leaders they wish to be
4518735 every generation has wondered and worried abut whether or not the next generation will be ready and able to handle the demands challenges and opportunities they will be leaving behind

4518747 the purpose of these talks is to settle the issue and there are many other options under consideration
4518748 the denials mean no more than that musharraf is holding out for a deal and that he doesnt want to create the impression that hes caved in and is on his way out

4518805 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 500 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users

4518808 as candidates are able to request a recount whenever their losing margin is less than one percentage point and given the slim margin separating the candidates at the top we feel it is in the best interest of the state and of all those who voted to make sure there is no error in tabulating the final results and that the votes of all citizens are counted for this important race
4518809 voting is the heart of the democratic process and we are pursuing a recount as that is the fairest way possible to make sure the peoples voice through the election is most accurately heard
4518810 i have received encouragement to pursue the recount from an overwhelming number of democratic primary voters at this stage the recount becomes a legal procedure

4518851 the time needed for the solar system to oscillate vertically about the plane of the galaxy which is 33 plus minus 3 myr according to the best current astronomical evidence

4518853 bars in spiral galaxies seem to be ubiquitous in our local universe
4518854 atmospheric ionization and clouds as links between solar activity and climate
4518855 the existence of a smooth source of gravity in galaxies is overwhelming this conclusion is completely scientific we know that the stars in the galaxy orbit at a rate that cannot be explained by adding up the gravity of the stars themselves this is not a small effect either gravity operates differently at large scales or there is matter that isnt bright evidence for the former option is strongly lacking evidence for the latter option is ubiquitous and self consistent not circular theres a difference
4518856 we believe that solar wind particles flow in along these ropes providing energy for geomagnetic storms and auroras

4518859 dive through the midplane of the milky way galaxy like a dolphin
4518860 a by product of this study is the determination of the half period of oscillation by the sun through the galactic plane 42 2myr
4518861 in the case of the absence of evidence of electrons approaching the sun this absence is compelling
4518862 an apparently scientific argument is said to be not even wrong if it is based on assumptions that are known to be incorrect or alternatively theories which cannot possibly be falsified or used to predict anything such theories are non scientific even when they are speaking in scientific language
4518863 but i am hard pressed to figure out why if astrophysicists should not be commenting on climate why climatologists physicist for rasmus should be commenting on astrophysics
4518864 ice age epochs and the suns path through the galaxy
4518865 we present a calculation of the suns motion through the milky way galaxy over the last 500 million years the integration is based upon estimates of the suns current position and speed from measurements with hipparcos and upon a realistic model for the galactic gravitational potential we estimate the times of the suns past spiral arm crossings for a range in assumed values of the spiral pattern angular speed
4518866 this theory explains practically all historic temperatures 1000 times better than the co2 hypothesis
4518867 but you just said you didnt even read the post meaning you will believe anything with the rc seal of approval on it a scientific attitude
4518868 we now have high confidence that the discrepancy is not caused by problems with the models of the sun but by changes in the neutrinos themselves as they travel from the core of the sun to the earth
4518869 earlier measurements had been unable to provide definitive results showing that this transformation from solar electron neutrinos to other types occurs the new results from sno combined with previous work now reveal this transformation clearly and show that the total number of electron neutrinos produced in the sun are just as predicted by detailed solar models
4518870 if these oscillating neutrinos can change back and forth maybe the measured electron neutrinos are the result of transformed tau neutrinos or muon neutrinos
4518871 1 why are we unable to detect any influx of electrons to the sun either equatorially or at the poles i will get the links when i can but there was at least one paper that told of electrons flowing back towards the sun after a maybe a flare i forget all the specific the source of the electrons wasnt clear but the migration of electrons towards the sun is in keeping with the electric suns model of a positive sun 2 did the planets orbit saturn in the past that specific question i have not seen before except as a discussion that if the solar system found itself in the middle of a strong plasma stream that exerted electromagnetic attractions or repulsions on the planets then could that re arrange the current solar systems orbital arrangement i dont know and it is low on my list to explore as there would be too many ifs is it as theoretically as possible as the big bang maybe but one solar system question that i have entertained i will share for those of you that have ever put a telescope on the moon or seen pictures of the craters on other planets yyou must be struck by the near perfect circularity of those craters literally sitting on a mountaintop peering through my dobsonian i was struck with the question the theory of meteorite formed craters implies to me that there should be a lot of craters more elliptic in shape this being so because the causative space debris would most likely be captured and fall at an angle to the surface to be so circular they would need to fall straight down however if instead electric arcing is attributed to these craters that would make sense as arcs like lightning do strike at very perpendicular angles and that suggest a lot of electric activity in the solar systems past 12 march 2008 at 2 10 am martin vermeer says where do i begin i picked this one as the most obviously absurd to refute how do you explain the rotation of the galaxy by electrostatic forces it has to be an attractive force to do the job dark matter gravitation is electrostatic forces are repulsive between like charges so we must have a distribution of opposite charges to do the job
4518872 the smaller problem here is to find a distribution of positive and negative charges that would produce the observed change in rotational behaviour you wont
4518873 the theory of meteorite formed craters implies to me that there should be a lot of craters more elliptic in shape this being so because the causative space debris would most likely be captured and fall at an angle to the surface to be so circular they would need to fall straight down
4518874 splitting of a spectral line into several symmetrical components in the presence of a static magnetic field
4518875 ice age epochs and the suns path through the galaxy
4518876 we find that for a difference between the mean solar and pattern speed of p 11 9 0 7 km s 1 kpc 1 the sun has traversed four spiral arms at times that appear to correspond well with long duration cold periods on earth this supports the idea that extended exposure to the higher cosmic ray flux associated with spiral arms can lead to increased cloud cover and long ice age epochs on earth
4518877 it is certainly true that the complete meteoritic data includes clusters of meteorites of the same type and that such clusters are most likely the result of a single parent body breaking up into many small pieces but this is totally irrelevant as detailed in shaviv 2002 and shaviv 2003 in order to neutralize this effect a modified meteoritic data set is generated using 80 k dated iron meteorites where clusters of meteorites of the same iron group classification are replaced with one having an average age thus the clustering can either be because of a variable crf or simply because parent bodies tend to break up more often periodically however it is not likely that single bodies generated each of the clusters since each cluster is now comprised of meteorites that are all of different iron group classification
4518878 i am hard pressed to figure out why if astrophysicists should not be commenting on climate why climatologists physicist for rasmus should be commenting on astrophysics
4518879 a meteorite comes in at about 7 km per second
4518880 for you to ask the question did i not think that scientists had ever thought about crater causes before is a a little weird it implies that what ever the current dogma that has been created is only questioned by fools which when i challenge some dogma here a few people prefer to argue less about evidence and instead link my ideas to fools i dont know
4518881 so nick perhaps you could return the favor and tell me what you think of the neutrino questions i posed that the
4518882 nor would they have understood what is meant by the darwinian conception of

4518885 still the electric star theory would also require that there be an adequate electrons to supply the power input to maintain a stars power output which for our sun is about 4x 10 26 can the ism supply that to the sun or other stars
4518886 hey us believer know better because we thought about it more
4518887 we find that for a difference between the mean solar and pattern speed of p 11 9 0 7 km s 1 kpc 1 the sun has traversed four spiral arms at times that appear to correspond well with long duration cold periods on earth
4518888 several recent studies amaral amp lepine 1997 bissantz et al 2003 martos et al 2004 advocate a spiral pattern speed of p 20 5 km s 1 kpc 1 and we show in figure 2 the suns trajectory projected onto the plane for this value p 6 3 km s 1 kpc 1 diamonds along the suns track indicate its placement at intervals of 100 myr we see that for this assumed pattern speed the sun has passed through only two arms over the last 500 myr
4518889 for what its worth i found it difficult to understand the points you were trying to make you presented the deficit of electron neutrinos as if it were a strong or even conclusive argument against the ssm clearly it isnt as the combination of the ssm and the theory of neutrino oscillation the possibility of which was raised before the deficit was found accounts for the data we have of course this doesnt amount to a proof of the ssm it could indeed be that the sun just happens to be producing the right total number of neutrinos in some other way or that some other source is involved but the fact that the total number detected is just what the ssm predicts would then be a most remarkable piece of bad luck suggesting that nature itself is conspiring to deceive us perhaps thats what you believe
4518890 the new detection methods employed using heavy water have demonstrated a methodology that enables us to sample a more complete population of the 3 known flavors of neutrinos the detection of a total population of neutrinos that is in line with the ssms prediction for electron neutrinos generated by solar fusion is of special interest although only one third of the predicted electron neutrinos were detected the possibility of neutrino oscillation leads us to speculate that the electron neutrinos were not missing at all but oscillated into the other flavors this points to important new lines of testable research needed to confirm our speculations and further our understanding of neutrino behavior is neutrino oscillation asymmetrical if electron neutrinos have the required higher probabilities of oscillating into muon and tau this would support our theory that our observed muon and tau electrons originated from a larger population of electron neutrons conversely if there is no asymmetrical oscillation or there is a higher probability of oscillating into electron neutrinos then we still have a missing electron neutrino problem
4518891 we find that for a difference between the mean solar and pattern speed of p 11 9 0 7 km s 1 kpc 1 the sun has traversed four spiral arms at times that appear to correspond well with long duration cold periods on earth this supports the idea that extended exposure to the higher cosmic ray flux associated with spiral arms can lead to increased cloud cover and long ice age epochs on earth
4518892 several recent studies amaral amp lepine 1997 bissantz et al 2003 martos et al 2004 advocate a spiral pattern speed of p 20 5 km s 1 kpc 1 and we show in figure 2 the sun s trajectory projected onto the plane for this value p 6 3 km s 1 kpc 1 diamonds along the sun s track indicate its placement at intervals of 100 myr we see that for this assumed pattern speed the sun has passed through only two arms over the last 500 myr
4518893 and it is exactly the 20 years of investment in a theory that makes you hostile to different ideas
4518894 the answer is that i got a ph d albeit in he reluctantly confesses psychology
4518895 the oceans havent cooled here for example is the 1993 2003 record of ocean heat content
4518896 now every time there is a gravitational anomaly it becomes
4518897 first why does the solar wind accelerate away from the suns and past the planets gravitational theory alone suggests it should decelerate
4518898 second why does the temperature beginning at the photosphere 5800k drop in the chromosphere and then jump to over 1 million k in the corona shouldnt we get cooler as we stand further from the fireplace
4518899 and since you mention the neutrino why are we missing the predicted neutrinos postulated for a strictly nuclear sun
4518900 and to generate neutrinos here on earth dont we use particle accelerators created by electromagnetic forces
4518901 and if you could be so kind i would appreciate a few links to your sources on how well the electric fields have been measured
4518902 i often say that abnormal psych was the best physics class i ever took as it taught me how to deal with physicists
4518903 my question isnt this a major negative feedback loop it is always presented as a consequence of agw but then it seems that people say things will keep on warming
4518904 but if we look at all the evidence it is not a debate about computing
4518905 how do you explain the rotation of the galaxy by electrostatic forces it has to be an attractive force to do the job dark matter gravitation is electrostatic forces are repulsive between like charges so we must have a distribution of opposite charges to do the job
4518906 4 my questions slightly edited in an attempt to improve clarity were whether you thought before your first post here on this issue either
4518907 nick i was glad my mountaintop musings on craters elicited such a response i never doubted that some craters even a few circular ones were caused by meteorites what i doubted was that the overwhelming number of craters would be circular i assumed that most entry angles would be below 45 degrees and make elliptical craters after discussion here i looked at some of the literature for the first time and found various lab estimates for entry angles of less than 20 down to less than 5 degrees in order to create ellipticals and if that holds true than the observed 5 percent occurrence of ellipticals would certainly minimize any arc induced craters
4518908 there are many canaries emerging in the climate change coal mine
4518909 the glaciers are perhaps among those making the most noise and it is absolutely essential that everyone sits up and takes notice
4518910 the latest figures are part of what appears to be an accelerating trend with no apparent end in sight
4518911 what you are describing sounds more like directional neutrino decay rather than neutrino oscillation are you saying electron neutrinos are the only neutrinos with enough energy to transform into the other flavors i am so confused
4518912 tried to point out the weaknesses in your arguments and the weakness and or your misinterpretation of the literature references you repeat in each thread
4518913 nick i thought the following was an adequate answer to your question on 113
4518914 i suppose if its our galaxy and not us to be blamed for the warming it would seem unnecessary to reduce our fossil fuel profligacy party
4518915 gw mitigation is the answer even if it doesnt mitigate gw
4518916 in a recent collaboration with dr gary burns of the australian antarctic division we have confirmed with high statistical significance small changes in antarctic surface pressure with small solar wind induced changes in jz which are consistent with our hypothesized effects on jz on cloud cover in the arctic the jz changes are of opposite sign as are the correlated pressure changes further there are pressure changes that correlate with jz changes due to changes in the current output of low latitude thunderstorm generators that have the same sign in the arctic as in the antarctic as expected from theory the implication is that global changes in jz produce global changes in suitable types of clouds and in some cases changes in precipitation
4518917 clearly there is a great deal of modeling that is needed in order to provide quantitative relationships between atmospheric ionization and macroscopic clouds properties however models of the radiative and dynamical consequences for climate of estimated precipitation and cloud cover changes could be made with present capabilities improved cloud cover and precipitation data covering more solar cycles would be useful for validating the present observational results and as more accurate inputs into global climate models
4518918 the large changes in galactic cosmic ray flux on time scales from decades through millennia produce changes in jz that have the potential to account for records of long term climate variations that correlate with cosmic ray flux changes also changes in temperature and humidity in the thunderstorm generating regions of land masses at low latitudes modulate the current density flowing everywhere in the global circuit this may affect cloud cover everywhere especially with surface temperature changes on the longer time scales
4518919 there are many uncertain steps between the electroscavenging and cyclone intensification in the near cloud mechanism as emphasised in hs99 so progress has been made either by looking at specific microphysics e g scavenging theory or from statistical studies linking cosmic rays with cloud related parameters such as precipitation
4518920 it is however more unlikely that electroscavaging has a global effect see harrison carslaw article on cloud generation and ultimately on global climate although there is some limited observational evidence to suggest that this process can have an additional influence on atmospheric dynamics roldugin and tinsley 2004
4518921 the importance of that correlation depends on whether gcr solar magnetic cycle changes actually do modulate clouds and the changes in clouds significantly affect planetary temperature
4518922 there havent been my comment bpl is saying there have not been four ice house in the last 500mmyr i disagree i recall there was the huronian snowball earth 2 3 billion years ago the sturtian 800 million years ago and the varangian 630 million years ago are you counting episodes of glaciation to any extent that might give you every 140 mya though i dont think it was that even
4518923 millennial scale paleoclimate cycles recorded in widespread palaeozoic deeper water rhythmites of north america
4518924 if our short term paleoclimatic interpretations for the rhythmites are correct then it is apparent that millennial scale climate changes occurred over a very wide spectrum of paleoceanographic paleogeographic paleoclimatic tectonic and biologic conditions and over time periods from the cambrian to the quaternary given this it is difficult to invoke models of internally driven thermohaline oceanic oscillations or continental ice sheet instabilities to explain their origin instead we suggest that millennial scale paleoclimate variability is a more permanent feature of the earths ocean atmosphere system which points to an external driver such as solar forcing
4518925 what the authors are stating is the planetary cooling appears to be externally forced and there is evidence of four long cold periods
4518926 presently it is not clear how very small perturbations in solar radiation could be amplified within the climate system to generate the observed significant climate changes
4518927 i think youre wrong but i just dont want to take the time to play right now
4518928 whats the difference between god and a doctor for one god doesnt think hes a doctor
4518929 my point is that hard felt religion shows justifiable in its mind extreme rage intolerance and offense including desire to arrest and incarcerate to those who might question and absolutely refuses to recognize let alone accept even the slightest uncertainty in the most obscure area of the institution occasionally agw proponents some or many but clearly not all by any means display the exact same characteristics and look like a religion
4518930 refuses to recognize let alone accept even the slightest uncertainty in agw
4518931 i say a he says b everyone knows that a is correct therefore b must be lying
4518932 i am aware of no religion that makes its creed subordinate to objective empirical evidence
4518933 these things are wholesome blameless commended by the wise and being adopted and put into effect they lead to welfare and happiness
4518934 why do people unconvinced that co2 drives temperature get called names
4518935 first off why is it that from 1940 through 1975 despite the post war industrial boom and skyrocketing co2 emissions did the planet cool dramatically
4518936 also why is it that a through scientific review of ice core samples taken from multiple locations shows co2 levels lagging behind temperature by several hundred years this second question makes it very difficult to accept logically co2 as a driver of temperature
4518937 its frustration that people keep trotting out the same old oft refuted objections without taking the trouble to find out why there is a scientific consensus that they are invalid all the points you raise have been dealt with on this site
4518938 a regional shift with decreases at nh midlatitudes and increases at the more photochemically active subtropical and tropical latitudes
4518939 the universe seems to be expanding ever faster a phenomenon generally ascribed to the influence of dark energy but might the observed acceleration be a trick of the light in an inhomogeneous universe
4518940 gus i think the problem is that unless you reject the notion that co2 and warming are related you dont have an observation thats not explainable by current science that calls for coming up with a new theory
4518941 the sun has been steady for 50 years but global warming has turned sharply upwards in the last 30 do you not understand
4518942 heat in the oceans doesnt get released to warm the land it pretty much just stays there
4518943 the northern hemisphere north of 10 n loses heat to the atmosphere as does the southern hemisphere between 10 and 40 s and south of 60 s note also that heat loss by the ocean to the atmosphere in the southern hemisphere occurs to some extent in the south pacific but is most intense in the indian ocean much of the latter energy must be imported from the pacific through the indonesian throughflow or the southern ocean
4518944 also if it was derived using 1366w m2 tsi then it gives me a 01 increase in tsi or if i use 342 w m2 it suggests a 06 increase the paper doesnt really state that very clearly
4518945 right gradually increases it doesnt stay flat for 2 5 of the time and then ramp steadily upward for the remaining 3 5 of the time your example is completely irrelevant
4518946 the abyssal warming may amount to a significant fraction of upper world ocean heat gain over the past few decades
4518947 this is how its done this is the whole point about reading cites following cites forward in time and never assuming you know everything the early work isnt some kind of foundation that overturns everything if its adjusted work gets done like this all the time dont get fixated on attacking yesterdays papers
4518948 however such solar variability persists on a timescale of a few decades at most
4518949 296 barton etc says we have good proxies which allow us to estimate it going back 400 years or so
4518950 use of proxies significantly extends the estimate of solar stability and the relatively good agreement of multiple independent proxies argues that the data are being correctly interpreted
4518951 gusbob i can only assume you dont read the news much
4518952 you dont even know enough about climate models to argue against them
4518953 those natural climate variations could be stronger than the global warming trend over the next 10 year period

4519083 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4519084 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now

4519132 lotta people think the gold around here was all gobbled up a century ago
4519133 they dont understand ill find you gold in five minutes
4519134 oh yeah people still get the fever so bad man they can taste it
4519135 first you want to shake it around with lots of water
4519136 the gold is 19 times heavier than water and it all sinks to the bottom you mostly find really fine flour gold around here
4519137 we havent gone as far as getting a claim yet maybe when the kids leave home
4519138 as soon as gold goes above 600 an ounce people start blanket claiming the entire province
4519139 they make it pretty easy if you have a gps and an internet link you can do it all online from the bush
4519140 i get out there about two months of the year
4519141 if the right opportunity struck id be out there full time youd see a gone prospecting sign in the window
4519142 if im going through princeton i always stop by the pub and buy the old timers a round some are tight lipped but you never know what they might tell you
4519143 the old guys probably sitting on 35 to 50 million there
4519144 you hear stories like that and it keeps you going yknow the early prospectors only took about 25 per cent of this provinces gold wealth according to mineral surveys that means three quarters is still out there waiting for you and me
4519145 the worst day prospecting on a creek beats the best day at the office
4519146 every spring that snow melts and pushes the gold off the mountains and down the streams
4519147 that means every year you got a fresh crop of gold in there not too many people know that
4519148 there it is colour in the pan like the stars in the sky
4519149 bob tuke democratic nominee for u s senate is a mere ten points behind incumbent senator lamar alexander in a recent poll of likely voters and expects to gain more widespread name recognition and support by replicating strategies used to win in the primary election in shelby county and davidson county including all its surrounding counties
4519150 when voters were told that senator alexander has received more than 360 000 from big oil interests has voted for unfair trade deals resulting in 43 000 lost manufacturing jobs in tennessee against medicare for seniors and tricare for military families and against updating g i bill benefits for veterans returning home from iraq and afghanistan poll results showed a shrinking alexander advantage of 49 to 39 putting tuke who has served as a marine vietnam combat veteran an adoption attorney with strong family values and a fiscal conservative who supports balanced budgets within striking distance of unseating senator alexander in november

4519160 look their hotel room is here we found evidence that puts them here we just dont have them they wandered off before we got the call to be here
4519161 the millstone had a waitress who though she recognized them she said they left with a blond woman in a blue car she didnt know the make or model
4519162 well its a start have the other agents arrived yet

4519165 the gori police chief is in gori trying to hold negotiations on the handover of the city
4519166 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4519167 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4519168 in order to get to that point there really did have to be important clarifications on a couple of these points in the ceasefire in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected
4519169 i am not planning to agree to any compromises with putins regime
4519170 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4519171 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4519172 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians

4519175 any way you slice it incomes arent keeping up with the inflation rate
4519176 people see it and they feel it on a daily basis
4519177 if its gasoline or food thats visible inflation and the stuff that households need the most and depend on
4519178 its a risk to drivers obviously and also to passengers and pedestrians
4519179 youre not looking at the road and you dont have both hands on the wheel
4519180 i can read them but i find the print too small a lot of this is generational im 52 if somebody sends me a text message i usually call them
4519181 the problem with that of course is that youre creating a very dangerous situation
4519182 we put a lot of thought into this and in the end were still open to changing if it doesnt work but we give drivers credit
4519183 its foolish to drive a car and try to text message at the same time but to criminalize all stupid behavior is fruitless
4519184 i suppose its just a matter of time before they try to ban smoking while driving
4519185 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war this is an act of aggression

4519192 i would appreciate areas where officers are given opportunity to travel out for workshops and seminars we want most of the officers in efcc to be well exposed we need a lot of support to bring officers up to date

4519229 the signs are not really very good for the future
4519230 the strains from the global economic downturn the surge in oil and commodity prices up until recently and the euro appreciation have been simply too strong
4519231 likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time
4519232 risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside
4519233 with growth slowing abruptly and inflation expectations off their peak risks of a near term ecb hike have been wiped out
4519234 if you thing things are going to get a lot better with the drop in petroleum prices think again
4519235 the increases were broad based but the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it
4519236 theres less employment theres less wealth and now banks are restraining credit
4519237 we just dont see where the consumer is going to get the money
4519238 the large increases in consumer expenses means that household income is actually declining when adjusted for inflation
4519239 confidence does not improve when the standard of living is declining and with unemployment claims still quite high we cannot expect much out of the consumer

4519254 the proposed price does not reflect the strength of unionbancals strong capital position the superior credit quality of its assets and its potential for profitable asset and core deposit growth in the current market environment

4519300 my response simply was did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me
4519301 but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4519302 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet

4519319 baby boomers are an extremely internet saavy and socially and sexually active group but many have already experienced a broad array of relationships or been married before today they are looking to stay social explore new horizons and meet interesting new people that are in the same place in life as they are which is exactly what inspired lavalifeprime

4519321 he swore in the name of allah and in accordance to the teachings of islam and as advised by religious scholars and teachers that i was sodomised by anwar ibrahim
4519322 ive taken this oath to prove that my allegations are completely true allah is the only place where i can complain to
4519323 ive done this for god and i do not wish to lie to the world as he anwar has done
4519324 ive not been hiding but i was quietly gathering enough courage to answer all the allegations against me especially by anwar ibrahim it needs mental and spiritual strength as taking an oath is not something trivial or easy the consequences can be very dire in the eyes of god nevertheless allah has given me the strength to take the oath today
4519325 this is not a political matter it is a private matter between me and anwar ibrahim

4519344 what an expired listing client says this is just not a good time to sell my home because of the current market conditions what a skilled consultant would say mr and mrs client you sound very certain that the market conditions are not right to sell your home may i ask what is your source for that data and how reliable has that source been for you in the past here are several mindful questions you might ask a person whose listing has expired what do you suppose will happen if you choose not to sell your home now if you do put your home back on the market with the same agent what do you suppose will be the result of that choice because marketing conditions and price positioning are the three reasons a homes sells or does not sell what do you imagine you will do differently when you re list your home imagine if you could create the perfect scenario what would it look like sound like and feel like for you how can you use what you have learned in the last six months to improve the chances of selling your home the next time you re list given what you have learned what is the most obvious change you would make first the next time you re list your home as you think about whom you will re list your home with what are some things that will be important to you in your next relationship with an agent how do you know the characteristics youre looking for in an agent are the right ones to achieve your goals what is reframing when reframing a belief or idea it is important to change the context so the listener has more choices and options regarding how to look at things its like using a different lens to get a wider perspective on the picture before you reframing client objections you should anticipate client objections below are different ways you can reframe a clients objections using dialogues containing magic words and mindful questions client objection this is not the right time to sell a home we want to wait until prices go up example 1 you are you saying in general it is not the right time to sell a home or are you saying its not the right time to sell your home client im saying the market is slow it is not a good time for anyone to sell you well its more accurate to say that people who are clearly focused on what is important about selling will be successful in selling a home in todays market may i ask you what is important about selling your home to you now go seven levels deep client objection this is not the right time to sell a home we want to wait until prices go up example 2 you that could be true for some people without certain goals now for those who have a goal like your five six and seven this may be the perfect time to go for it example 3 you every coin has two sides to it for example in the price range of 250 000 prices have dropped about 10 percent and in the 400 000 range they have dropped 10 percent so now when you sell your 250 000 home you get 25 000 less but when you buy the 400 000 house you pay 40 000 less so that is a net gain of 15 000 example 4 you if i said that it is a good time to go for your five six and seven and if i could show you that in the last 60 days 49 people within five square miles of your home have sold their home would that mean im lying to you specifically what proof would you need to know that your thoughts that you cant sell right now are just not true and it is the right time for you to go for your five six and seven example 5 you wow you sound so confident in your information did you actually try to sell your home within the last 60 days to arrive at that conclusion or are you repeating something you heard from the tv newspaper or a neighbor example 6 you well if you really want to know who should not be selling their home its the people who are either not serious about moving or the ones who owe more on it than its worth which category do you fit into example 7 you so are you saying that every seller who is listed now should just quit and take it off the market example 8 you i know the current market situation really seems like a big deal today and maybe thats the problem just for the fun of it imagine you and your family twenty years down the road you look back to this day when you had the opportunity to sell your house and make your next investment within this context is the current market situation the most important factor in making your decision to re list now example 9 you i know you believe that this is not the right time to sell your home but not everybody thinks this way many homeowners in your neighborhood have benefited from my skills as a consultant negotiator and overseer of transactional details during their home sale especially now why dont you call this number and listen to what your neighbors have to say about selling their home under these market conditions here is another example of an objection you may hear from a prospective client with several ways to reframe their perspective using magic words and mindful questions client will you cut your commission or reduce your fees example 1 you that is a good question and before i could make that big of a decision i would have to ask you a few thought provoking questions listen intently to your answers and only after i clearly know what is important about selling to you could i then better suggest how you can compensate me for my consulting negotiating and organizing of the details example 2 you that is an interesting question what it means to me is that you dont think my skills of consulting negotiating and organizing of all the transactional details are worth what i would charge you to make your five six and seven come true example 3 you mr and mrs seller my goal is to make your five six and seven come true since we havent worked together before how did you determine that my skills as a consultant negotiator and organizer of the transactional details are not worth making your making your five six and seven come true example 4 you your question reveals what you may not know about this current marketplace what you really should be asking is what bonus can we offer to get local agents more interested in showing my home to their best clients that way we can make certain your five six and seven come true example 5 you im glad you brought that up because it seems you really do care about getting the proper value from the services i offer so im wondering for what im asking you to compensate me how much value do you want from me for making your five six and seven come true

4519362 theyre looking for us to release sonny bill from his contract at the moment hes one year into a five year deal hes contracted to us
4519363 we havent started putting any figures on it we have no idea of where this will head
4519364 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4519365 its affected our recruitment its affected our players currently its affected our sponsorship and it will affect our attendances
4519366 its a big decision and all those things will be taken into account when we start talking to them
4519367 there is an effect on the club it will continue to have an effect on the club there isnt another sonny bill out there to replace him both in the short term and the long term
4519368 were in the market now because we have to be
4519369 2009s around the corner were in great shape for 2009 this frees up some more money potentially down the track if sonny doesnt want to be part of the club
4519370 eliminate many of the inconsistencies that existed in the system over the first three years of the a league
4519371 the regulations were reviewed because we wanted to ensure that footballs disciplinary provisions are not only consistent with those of the sport internationally but also with community expectations within australia
4519372 this club you are talking about obviously it is a heritage thing
4519373 the sanfl has played a big part in my life the three clubs i have played with in particular norwood where i started
4519374 so the short answer is just a strong emotional attachment i have to this club in particular the way it was formed what it represents you know its a representation of the 10 clubs at the time of sanfl footy
4519375 i was lucky enough to play for a long time in the sanfl play state footy for the sanfl so it is purely a personal very much a personal individual point of view
4519376 im not saying it is right probably only right for me its just the way i feel about sa footy and if i can put something back into it for this club only that would do me
4519377 the good thing about this year is weve bonded really well especially the young guys coming through and the mateship between us is really strong and you can see it in the way were playing
4519378 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world
4519379 to some extent the ball is in their court but at the same time were obviously very interested in taking on advice from all the various sources right now
4519380 were very short of time now if were going to relocate that decision needs to be made in the next few days so time is of the essence
4519381 the whole basis of the champions trophy is its the best eight teams the best players so not only would it be very disappointing if we had lesser teams taking the place of our major teams
4519382 but even if those teams went and were understrength it would also be a disappointment to us
4519383 thats been probably the hardest thing to tell you the truth
4519384 were only three weeks away from one of the biggest one day tournaments that we play and yet we still dont know if were going but well deal with that in a professional manner
4519385 its a minor adjustment to the tour schedule for south africa but from our perspective we see this champions league event as being a very exciting development for cricket
4519386 pure is an action sports game like no other that lets you soar off huge peaks and see for miles in the distance while you pull adrenaline inducing tricks
4519387 the demo will give fans a limited but intense sample of the gameplay and provide practice for when the game is released in late september

4519396 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4519397 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4519398 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4519399 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4519400 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4519401 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4519402 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4519412 well what do you know youre smarter than you look boy
4519413 its what you get for being a doctors kid knowing random and completely useless information
4519414 well you know sorry son i didnt catch your name
4519415 beloved interesting well you know leif some people would find all those nonsense facts intriguing you may be surprised
4519416 yeah thats nice and all but im just tired of being that kid the doctors kid and nothing else people dont actually care who i am or what i want they just know what my parents do and they assume it runs in the family like ill follow in his footsteps or something i just need a break from it all harvard princeton yale all shoved down my throat i want to puke it out on everyone
4519417 maybe they are just trying to support you and encourage you to do the best that you can and maybe they so im driving down atlantic avenue when i find myself pulling over and stopping to let in a man that i didnt even see in the first place and im thinking to myself
4519418 in a fish bowl year after year running over the same old ground
4519419 so many yellow taxi cabs vee are in a yellow taxi cab it is like all american yah
4519420 yah vee come for our tventieth anniversary right my snuggle bunny

4519424 tell me about it and they certainly arent getting any longer where to
4519425 is there decent support in that seat of yours i could just imagine the back problems that would result from a terribly sunken seat after eight or nine hours of solid sitting may even cause arthritis you know
4519426 ah ha so you are a doctor i owe myself five bucks
4519427 what was your first clue indeed i am a very rewarding job but some days i have to admit i do go home asking myself why i chose this profession and not something like an architect or or a chef or a window cleaner you know
4519428 there wouldnt be grey walls and abandoned cots stranded in hallways and devastated parents who refuse to leave their childs bedside one of my patients hes eight years old and gave up fighting today eight years old it just doesnt register sometimes like ive become completely detached from the part of me that could feel
4519429 my wife my kids my own bed its how i am able to do it all and what i would do anything for
4519430 just the super eight the one by holdens park i believe
4519431 umm yes im here for well i havent figured that part out yet but im from the south coast the time difference is making me crazy sleepy so i am finally ready to give in and go to sleep then hopefully i can get up early enough to watch the sun and fog and all those magical occurrences that only happen when the city still sleeps
4519432 well actually its a long and twisted story but basically im here to find someone that i know nothing about except that he still lives in this city and is a coffee addict i know its a little ridiculous and my chances probably arent very high but its just something i have to do
4519433 the big thing for us is winning our supporters back after what we dished up on the weekend
4519434 i dont think we talked about what lays ahead of us after this weekend it was just about rewarding our supporters and all the people that back our club with a good performance because what we dished up last week was really disappointing
4519435 we went through the video first thing on the monday it was obviously hard viewing but it was something that had to be done
4519436 we all said that once wed watched the video and gone through wed all move on and get ready for the week
4519437 i know thered be a lot of proud boys in that bulldogs team that certainly wouldnt want to have that title
4519438 i know it the wooden spoon happened here at the club last year and it really hurt people at the club it can take a lot of confidence out of an organisation and i know theyll be fighting hard
4519439 its his ankle thats the problem so its going to be a couple of weeks at least if not worse
4519440 thats not good news for us hell have a scan tomorrow and see how he goes
4519441 we competed pretty well but their execution in these conditions under pressure was excellent they do it so well
4519442 it was a good performance especially the first half its hard to be critical of too much we did
4519443 theres no denying if he tries to play well run at him
4519444 it wouldnt surprise me if he played but back six weeks after breaking an arm its a big ask
4519445 long term that could be an issue and hes a pretty valuable commodity
4519446 he looked outstanding training on wednesday and showed no signs of any problems with his knee at all
4519447 hes tough to try and come back this early he has to be tough
4519448 prince is coming back early from an arm injury that could be vulnerable not only this year but for coming years
4519449 they titans know the facts a lot better than me
4519450 but he prince is a quarterback and theyre the most valuable commodities in the game
4519451 youd think theyd be ticking all the boxes like we are with jt
4519452 at this time of the year at 12 0 where were trying to get to what we want to achieve later on in the season it just cant happen
4519453 two weeks ago we played canberra here and i thought i performance was good
4519454 on a positive note its probably good its happened tonight because we can address it leading into the next few games
4519455 it was a big night for locky lockyer but i was happy to spoil his party
4519456 you can have all the wheels you like but it doesnt matter unless the guys in the middle get it done
4519457 i dont know where that what came from to be honest with you
4519458 the penalty had been completed and everything else and they blow a penalty for being offside
4519459 if youre offside youre offside it should have been called long before he made the tackle
4519460 he puts the guys on the ground and all of a sudden hes offside
4519461 its the same situation everyone knew when we were in the
4519462 its the same situation everyone knew when we were in the staging camp in kuala lumpur
4519463 it is probably my downfall i eat whatever tastes good
4519464 i want to know where australia house is this is it australia house is here in holland house
4519465 hopefully i can win another medal in london in 2012 and then im going to buy a ten pound flight to holland and celebrate with all you guys
4519466 we gave the ball away too easily at stages but weve got a lot of boys missing so im very happy under the circumstances
4519467 i thought adrian caceres had a great game and was always threatening down the left hand side
4519468 it was backs to the wall stuff and we nearly nicked it in the end
4519469 we took the wrong options at times especially in the final third but it was a game i thought we dominated especially with possession
4519470 we gave the ball away too easily at stages but weve got a lot of boys missing so im very happy under the circumstances
4519471 i thought adrian caceres had a great game and was always threatening down the left hand side
4519472 clearly its a major threat anytime a small group of individuals can use off the shelf tools and consolidated brain power to compromise the identities of tens of millions of people its a threat that every single person needs to understand and consider
4519473 the medias continued focus on the topic will help marshal the resources both private and public that can mitigate and potentially eliminate many of the most dangerous forms of web crime we see today
4519474 irgendwann muss ein ende sein das w re auch unfair gegen ber jenen 11 000 die sich bereits legalisiert haben
4519475 what we had on the coast was pretty special and johnny aloisi coming in last year lifted all the players standard
4519476 but here going through the squad and what players coach ernie merrick has at his disposal its all looking good
4519477 its positive signs and weve got a really strong squad
4519478 theyre a great bunch of blokes and theyre easy to get along with
4519479 the match against croatia is the most important if we win we are practically qualified for the next round
4519480 the mbta does not demand that the mit undergrads forever refrain from disclosing information that will compromise or threaten to compromise the security of its fare media systems instead under industry accepted principles of responsible disclosure the mbta demands that the mit undergrads refrain from such disclosure until the mbtas system vendors have remedied the security flaw the mit undergrads have identified
4519481 nach allem was geschehen ist wird es f r abchasen und osseten kaum noch m glich sein in einem georgischen staat zu leben

4519483 volle achtung der souver nit t und territorialen integrit t georgiens
4519484 id like to play in the first one i think its still a possibility but i havent run yet
4519485 i dont think contact work will be an issue its just whether it swells up or i can actually run properly thats the big one
4519486 its one of those things ive been used to for a long time now playing off the bench
4519487 ive been ready for test football for the last eight weeks so if the opportunity was going to come up earlier on i wouldve been ready and im ready this week
4519488 everyone suffers their fair share of injuries ive not been excluded from that but its one of those things and he burgess will be back at some stage
4519489 the opportunity is there for myself to press for another start to try and play out the tri nations in a number nine jersey is something i would love to do
4519490 any player that has seven centre clearances by halftime then youre in trouble
4519491 we threw three or four different combinations at him after halftime we were able to rein it in he had two in the third or none in the last either he got sick of getting it or we did something reasonably well
4519492 i thought we got quite a good response from our players from last weeks disappointing game
4519493 to go inside 50m the same amount of times win the hard ball gets and the clearances shots on goal were pretty similar
4519494 a lot of their goals we kicked it straight to them

4519505 i will probably sit down with general manger andrew ireland at the end of this year and talk through some things
4519506 i dont think there is any hurry from my point of view and the clubs point of view
4519507 i think particularly when you are in the midst of trying to play finals everyone is focused and weve all been pretty up front on it as well
4519508 at this stage it is not really an issue for me and its not an issue for the club
4519509 to be honest i havent really thought about that its not really an issue its not something that i think too much about im more worried about geelong tomorrow night
4519510 i never set out to be a 20 year coach and that certainly hasnt change
4519511 at the moment its good im enjoying it weve got a big game tomorrow night which is exciting to be part of and a great group of players
4519512 ive never considered myself a career coach and however long it goes for who knows
4519513 hes really managing the staff helping your medical staff talking to them talking to your recruiting guys
4519514 unless youre willing to take in the mother and baby you should hold your tongue
4519515 if i am in a race then i want to win it
4519516 it is never great fun to be fifth or sixth even third place doesnt feel so great to me any more i only want to win
4519517 whoever thinks i am content or tired are completely wrong
4519518 if we do not get both championship titles at the end of the season then we will be disappointed

4519520 de receptie alleen nog maar voor organisaties is en dat burgers niet welkom zijn
4519521 increased competition from the existing home market coupled with the elimination of the pent up demand that built up during the 1990s will exert downward pressure on housing starts which will decline to 194 000 units in 2009 from 215 000 in 2008
4519522 and that wouldnt be right for the people that work there if they want to unionize obviously theres something not going well with management but as far as professional ethics go these people have rights and they should be voiced
4519523 in addition because its a shorter crop a lot more of the crop is going into the fresh market so theres a lot less available for the juice market
4519524 its basically weather problems on a global basis and probably next year if the growing conditions are good we should see it back up to normal in the summer of 2009
4519525 they are waiting for a shipment when i dont know
4519526 we go every day they say they dont have it in stock and the big suppliers in town and in the city say they are still waiting for the shipment but it has been a month and a half now
4519527 for the past three weeks we have been shorted lemon juice however we still on our shelves have our organic lemon juice and we have not sold out of that speaking with our suppliers in regard our lemon juice we should have our shelves filled by the first of the week

4519544 i think one thing thats going to hold him back might be his defense
4519545 a lot of it is just being so young and not playing enough he doesnt know how to slow the game down but i think once he figures that out i think hes going to be good and if you put both of them together strong bat with a good glove and with the arm hes got he could be something good
4519546 its not a life or death experience but you should give it a try and see what comes out of it

4519563 michael heeft een idee en dat werkt hij uit zo verwijzen een aantal nummers op deze plaat naar onze vorige albums daarnaast staan er ook weer gewone volbeat nummers op waar je helemaal los op kunt gaan
4519564 we zijn ooit gestart als metalband dat klonk ook best goed maar we wilden meer het is zo beperkend om binnen n genre te blijven terwijl er nog zoveel meer mogelijk is een beetje bij toeval zijn we rocknroll gaan spelen die ge nspireerd is op de 60s en 70s ondertussen bleef ons metalgeluid toch ook behouden nu maken we de unieke combinatie van die twee genres ons geluid is metal maar onze muziek is rocknroll
4519565 als je midden in een tour zit is het soms niet leuk je zit uren in een bus en dat kan gaan vervelen maar na een aantal jaren samen hebben we allemaal een beetje dezelfde humor gekregen als er iemand doorheen zit dan worden er wat grappen gemaakt zo zijn er running gags die al jaren gedaan worden maar toch leuk blijven lachend voor ons in ieder geval wel
4519566 je doet het allemaal voor de liveshow dat is beter dan welke drug of drank dan ook die ontlading daar kan niets tegen op anders ga je ook niet tien uur naar nederland in de bus zitten een optreden doen en dan weer tien uur naar huis rijden
4519567 we hebben een heavy uitstraling maar dat zijn we helemaal niet michael lijkt een metalhead maar hij is bijvoorbeeld n van de grootste elvis fans die er is we hebben een keer met oud muzikanten van elvis gespeeld en die lui waren zoveel meer rocknroll dan wij we werden weggespeeld door een paar grijze bejaarden

4519573 we moeten de dag na lowlands misschien maar gewoon kappen
4519574 het is een nieuw hoogtepuntje en lowlands is zeker h t festival waar we ons thuis moeten voelen maar we moeten eerst nederland nog veroveren en het zou mooi zijn als we in het buitenland ook iets van de grond krijgen
4519575 we waren echt de joop zoetemelk van de popmuziek en hoeveel optredens wij niet hebben gedaan voor 50 en een krat bier e n keer kregen we er zelfs een meezingende barvrouw bij
4519576 na mijn tour in 2003 zat ik er volledig doorheen ik wist niet meer waarom ik eigenlijk deed wat ik deed ik leefde als een robot album pers tour ik moest er tussenuit en besloot dus mijn jamaicaanse neven in new york te bezoeken maar toen ik daar eenmaal was beviel het rondhangen op straat en in clubs me opperbest en vlogen de jaren om vervolgens ging ik naar la voor wat klussen en kwam ik weer in zon cyclus terecht vijf jaar is een stuk korter dan je denkt
4519577 die tussenliggende jaren had ik ook echt nodig ik ben niet het soort performer die een routineus showtje kan afdraaien dan word ik gek nu voel ik het weer ben ik herboren

4519613 barbarians look this is georgian democracy if it werent for russia we would have already been buried here
4519614 theres still some occasional sniper fire but we are finishing them off steadily and surely
4519615 first parties to the conflict must not resort to force second they absolutely stop any military action third there must be free access to humanitarian aid fourth the georgian armed forces need to be returned to their permanent bases fifth the russian armed forces will be moved back to their positions before the military action sixth the beginning of international discussion of south ossetias and abkhazias future status

4519631 cats especially are extremely sensitive to insecticides and pets can die from improper use of flea control products
4519632 just a few drops of concentrated permethrin present in many spot on treatments for dogs can be lethal to cats
4519633 we have a mayor and council who are afraid to act
4519634 el contexto se vuelve cada vez m s violento y los menores sufren tiene miedo se confunden y algunos hasta mueren en medio de las balas o en las manos de los secuestradores es indignante
4519635 la cultura de la violencia se instala del lado de los delincuentes del estado y de la sociedad pero nadie piensa en los menores en los adultos del ma ana
4519636 creciendo en am rica del norte salud y seguridad de la infancia en canad estados unidos y m xico

4519649 ham s logr en buena medida establecer la ley y el orden en las calles de gaza y han cesado los secuestros no se lo considera corrupto como en el caso de fatah
4519650 at a news conference on sunday the deputy national security adviser said we have noted that the russians have introduced two ss 21 medium range ballistic missile launchers into south ossetia
4519651 you do a bad thing and a bad thing happens to you
4519652 todas as tropas russas e qualquer tropa paramilitar e irregular que tenha entrado com elas devem partir imediatamente
4519653 punir a ge rgia por ousar tentar se integrar ao ocidente
4519654 infelizmente depois do que aconteceu pouco prov vel que os ossetas do sul e os abkh zios possam viver num mesmo estado com os georgianos
4519655 considero que a rea o da r ssia foi desproporcional
4519656 cachorros abanam o rabo porque est o em conflito eles querem ficar e sair de perto ao mesmo tempo eles est o felizes e nervosos ou apreensivos est o curiosos e com medo
4519657 theyre technically powerful but not as elegant as apples aapl iphone and os x
4519658 we have had to simultaneously fight the taliban build more than a dozen defensive strong points train new afghan national police and conduct civic action programs to win over the local population and were doing it our motto ready for all yielding to none says it all
4519659 nothing in the field manuals could fully prepare us for this but we adapt and overcome
4519660 here im saying clearly i oppose barack obama and the book is designed to lay this information out and let the american public decide
4519661 he was registered as a muslim the documentation i thoroughly researched it from the indonesian newspapers and indonesian television he attended mosque with his stepfather
4519662 the friends who were in school with him attest that he was then considered a muslim and thats the testimony of the people in indonesia who grew up in those six years
4519663 right now vile smear peddler jerome corsi is back with a new book of lies this time about barack obama well need the combined efforts of every member of the action wire to push back against this years vicious republican attack book
4519664 together well show corsi and the right wing smear machine that we wont back down from a fight
4519665 if you get one of these e mails that says im a muslim not true that never been a muslim this is just stuff that is designed to make people suspicious
4519666 obamas mother chose another third world prospect for her second husband a second man of color to be her mate
4519667 i stated they were not written to express my true views they were intentionally written to be antagonistic or aggressive or provocative the catholic church im a good member i was born and raised in the catholic church
4519668 you cant take a few quips that ive wrote that ive apologized for that should not have been written and i have not done again to be representative of my beliefs and writing
4519669 i dont think anybodys going to take jerome corsi all that seriously once they learn who this guy really is even people on the right wing havent associated themselves with him because of some of the pretty bigoted and outrageous things hes said in his career
4519670 now four years later he has come out with another book that is also riddled with distortions and falsehoods so the question is why on earth would anyone listen to what he has to say about barack obama
4519671 ive written against john mccain very strongly for the last four years on his immigration policy i wrote a series of articles in world net daily of john mccains connections with george soros the book is not written to support john mccain i am constitution party i make it very clear in the introduction ill be voting for chuck baldwin of the constitution party
4519672 this book is a legitimately published book its published with the investigative research in this book that is not being touched here all thats happening is im getting called names its an ad hominem attack
4519673 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4519674 you are dealing with a people who despise anyting human
4519675 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4519676 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4519677 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4519678 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4519679 we really have to face the fact that mistakes are made in museums just as they are made anywhere else
4519680 museums are in the habit of hiding these things away
4519681 ketika ada beberapa orang karyawan yang mengeluh mual dan berakhir muntah muntah kami membawanya ke rumah sakit namun ternyata jumlahnya bertambah hingga mencapai seratusan orang
4519682 namun hingga kini tidak ada satu pun yang harus mendapatkan perawatan inap sehingga para karyawan langsung pulang ke rumah masing masing
4519683 our goal in pursuing a combination of cadence and mentor graphics was to create a company that would offer customers a broader and more fully integrated product and technology portfolio in a timeframe that would better enable them to address urgent and complex challenges associated with their next generation product development
4519684 cadence is a disciplined buyer and will only pursue transactions that make sound financial sense for our shareholders mentor graphics failure to engage in substantive discussions on our all cash premium proposal prevented us from confirming for our financing sources the significant synergies associated with this transaction that along with our revised outlook and the present economic climate led us to conclude that financing terms for the transaction are no longer attractive for our shareholders we remain focused on executing our strategy of delivering holistic solutions that address our customers key challenges while ensuring that cadence operates in the most cost efficient manner
4519685 leadership qualities what does it take to be a good leader
4519686 it is a tremendous opportunity to share leadership experiences from around the world great leaders are life long learners i am honored to be part of this learning experience in latin america
4519687 timesys is recognized as the industry leader in providing embedded linux solutions
4519688 we are pleased to partner with timesys to deliver all the software tools and support needed to build linux based products around tensilica processors
4519689 tensilica processors offer developers a great deal of flexibility when optimizing a design for system level performance
4519690 linuxlink helps these same design teams simplify the associated complexity of building an embedded linux platform for either the diamond standard 232l or for their xtensa custom processor core
4519691 with millions of dollars and other currencies at stake professional sports cannot compete without the financial security provided by insurance
4519692 but the real problem is teams that lose star players could be left footing the bill
4519693 the unique 3d technology enhancement for the ma300 mask aligner provides our customers with best in class equipment performance that enables them to meet the increasing challenges for 3d interconnect applications
4519694 you can sort of look at it as if what if i wasnt really a good player but that tackle made me out to be a good player
4519695 so its just one of those things who knows what might have happened
4519696 it took a couple of years to get back in the national team but everythings got its place i dont see it as being too negative i try to take the positive or else i still wouldnt be playing
4519697 i havent played in melbourne since i first left i had a good time in perth and made some really good friends but the heart of football in this country is on this side of the country whether it be sydney or melbourne
4519698 i havent been part of a derby yet and speaking to the boys from both teams theres always a derby feel
4519699 what sort of team would we be if people didnt expect us to do very well
4519700 were a club that needs to be in the finals our supporters and members expect us to be in the finals and if thats high expectations thats the way it should be
4519701 weve got the team to make the finals theres a lot of excitement around but were well aware the pre season cup is over and the slate is wiped clean and lets get off to a good start the first seven games are very important for us to get off to a good start this year
4519702 its great to have rivalries in sport and weve got great rivalries with adelaide and sydney and this sydney one is going to be a blockbuster
4519703 i cant think of a better way than starting off the season with sydney and melbourne it should set a standard for the way we want to play for the rest of the season
4519704 his right price is somewhere between 1 80 and even money
4519705 anything shorter is too short having said that every time we take this horse on he puts a knife to us they always say never take on a champion and hes every bit a champion
4519706 were hoping hell be 100 per cent by race morning
4519707 these things take a bit of time you need to wait for the bruising to come out
4519708 hes alright at the moment but not quite 100 per cent
4519709 i think hes pretty well but maybe im not quite as chirpy as i have been
4519710 but youre prepared to be surprised with a good horse and light fantastics the best ive had
4519711 hes a very good sprinter miler and only time will tell if hes anything more than that
4519712 there have been lots of things said that are going to be put in place lets hope those things are put into place to an appropriate level
4519713 its a hypothetical question the ones who you probably have heard from before would not go but well wait and see what happens in the next few days
4519714 i think the australians put their views across in a very polite way perhaps not as animated and cynical as the new zealand players
4519715 in any team situation you are going to get the jokers and you are going to get the guys with the comments which might present a different picture
4519716 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning that request
4519717 he spent 30 minutes telling me peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4519718 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4519719 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4519720 but i was not going to out of the blue go because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice
4519721 our way of life is obviously so much better than yours adopt it now or else
4519722 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4519723 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4519724 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4519725 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4519726 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4519727 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4519728 ooh gooddy send me gt to the twilight zone again
4519729 abdoulaye is a fantastic player with top flight experience in abundance
4519730 we have worked extremely hard to conclude the deal and we are absolutely delighted to have signed a player of his quality

4519732 estima se que pelo menos 43 5 dos trabalhadores 1 3 mil milh es de pessoas n o ganhem o suficiente para conseguirem ficar bem como as suas fam lias acima da linha de pobreza de dois d lares por dia

4519735 i am hopeful however that something will happen before the deadline as there is money to spend
4519736 we have not been able to strengthen but if you look around the clubs it has been quite difficult for most of them
4519737 these things happen in football and everton are not the only ones with this problem
4519738 i want to continue the progress we have made over the last four or five years
4519739 everton have done really well and we have changed the club around in that time
4519740 we have been fortunate enough to have bits of success regarding our league position considering the position we were in five or six years ago there has been a big improvement
4519741 we have climbed away from the bottom of the league and our football has improved it is always my ambition to crack the top four
4519742 i have to make sure i can continue to make everton grow thats my job
4519743 everton are growing and we have a ground to play in it is a great stadium
4519744 so it is not too big an issue at the moment but we do need either a new stadium or a new goodison
4519745 police received reports of damage to the paintwork of a vehicle
4519746 it is inappropriate to comment on the content of an anonymous letter
4519747 at the time of writing ofcom is not aware of any practical implementations of the technology approaches implied in this report that would lead to substantial increases in speeds being achieved on bts copper network
4519748 were better than that one inning that was one inning out of 10
4519749 thats what we were saying in the media village afterward
4519750 we wish we couldve gotten it done then we had so much going for us then we wish we couldve kept playing it wouldve been nice but hey thats part of softball
4519751 it was just one of those days its hard not to say that we kind of beat ourselves a little bit
4519752 since 1997 the government has acted to improve the position of homeworkers we agree that homeworkers are a valuable part of the uks flexible workforce and are keen to ensure they are provided with appropriate rights and protections including the national minimum wage
4519753 in 2005 the government introduced fair piece rates legislation to ensure that homeworkers who do piecework receive at least the same as the minimum wage when paid per item produced or task performed failure to pay the minimum wage or a fair piece rate can ultimately result in prosecution
4519754 i n the past the government has given funding to the national group on homeworking to help ensure that homeworkers are able to access their rights
4519755 on the wider issue of employment status and distinctions between
4519756 as long as i dont forget the past im cool one must always be mindful just like you might forget that old girlfriend who tried to slit your throat but shes really still hot if you remember the stitches more than you remember the pussy youre going to be just fine
4519757 i didnt have an identity it was manufactures my identity now it was written on the wall by ancient forces the best thing i can do is keep my hand out of it
4519758 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
4519759 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4519760 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4519761 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
4519762 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this
4519763 customers want access to content from a broad variety of sources how when and where they choose
4519764 it to the mobile phone of a friend or the car stereo of someone who has satellite radio
4519765 oh its the newest technology i have a phone built right into my hand
4519766 its the same as my first album thug motivation 101
4519767 when money was plentiful i was the first one who told you to stack it live your life with it now that money slowed up ima be the one telling you to save it like they aint gon make it no more
4519768 i wouldnt say that i was capitalizing off of it
4519769 you wanna know who is capitalizing off of it you gotta go talk to bush hes at the basketball games over in china gas is like 9 almost it seems like but hes enjoying himself while the rest of us are suffering
4519770 if people call me a lesbian because i have short hair and i wear jeans instead of dresses then by all means run with it i think its hilarious i like guys
4519771 when i was 12 and had crushes on guys id put my first name with their last name but it never sounded right rumer depp nope in school kids would sing rumer rumer with a big hairy tumor
4519772 its shocking how unbelievably mean people are not just the people who are writing stuff the people who make comments
4519773 sure i have my issues but im not in rehab im not in crazy debt i like the fact that i didnt just get my ged but i graduated from high school a lot of it has to do with my parents they have a desire to keep us kids grounded and give us a normal upbringing
4519774 hes so cool he definitely is a father slash older brother figure but at the same time i can still go out with him and have an amazing time we all have so much fun together
4519775 it is wrong and weakens our military to have us troops tied down in iraq awaiting the iraqi politicians to settle their difference starting a war with iraq was a terrible decision
4519776 we cannot be a competitive or caring nation if all our citizens do not have healthcare
4519777 our american people to gas prices determined by foreign dictators
4519778 your children deserve an education that allows them to compete in the world and they deserve well paying jobs when they graduate
4519779 we had a surplus when bush took over we now have the largest debt in world history that is not what we should be leaving to our children and grandchildren
4519780 our success as a nation has depended upon faith in our democratic processes and the application of the rule of law we need to restore faith in our democracy starting at the highest levels of government
4519781 for the last 8 years most americans have been invisible to the bush mccain republicans
4519782 only has not taken any lobbyist special interest money mccain bathes in it
4519783 wont it be easier note when times are hard for people seeing a way they can become easier is a great right brain connector and note again i said
4519784 you dont generate your own electricity why generate your own computing
4519785 h um atraso na produ o n s sentimos que temos uma oportunidade no ver o
4519786 nunca vamos fazer nada que possa prejudicar um dos filmes ou a s rie n s amamos nossos f s
4519787 its an olive branch that we think will pay dividends in party unity
4519788 the one thing that obama should never have agreed to is a roll call vote with hillary clinton
4519789 so grateful that we are going to have a story which is hillary clintons attempt tacitly to take over the obama victory and that story will go through virtually every day of the convention
4519790 der sozialplan ist nicht neu er l uft schon seit f nf jahren jetzt haben wir ihn bis ende 2009 erneuert
4519791 wir haben bis juni im jahresvergleich den personalstand um 300 stellen gesenkt allerdings betraf das in erster linie die paketsparte wo ein drittel der zustellbasen geschlossen wurden
4519792 wir rechnen zu jahresende mit einem cash flow von 250 bis 270 mio euro und haben 380 mio euro an liquiden mitteln
4519793 damit k nnen wir alle investitionen akquisitionen den aktienr ckkauf und die dividende zahlen
4519794 wir glauben dass die aktie unterbewertet ist und potenzial hat
4519795 die jetzt beschlossenen abschusszahlen lassen den noblen alten jagdtraditionen der region endlich gerechtigkeit widerfahren wir sch tzen die j ger bisher wurden sie allzu oft kriminalisiert
4519796 abgesehen von gelegentlichen zwischenhochs ist das ein st ndiger abw rtstrend bei der sozialdemokratie
4519797 wenn eine partei noch einen klassischen kernw hler f r sich beanspruchen kann dann ist das die vp bei den vollerwerbsbauern die kann sie zu 80 bis 85 prozent f r sich reklamieren
4519798 ein problem das damals aber auch die vp mit ihren schwarzen gewerkschaftern hatte
4519799 dass faymann dem gegensteuert indem er eine koalition mit der fp kategorisch ablehnt
4519800 mit dem verpflichtenden kindergartenjahr spricht vp chef wilhelm molterer ein feministisches junges thema an und steuert der sozialkompetenz der sp entgegen er verr t aber auch die wirtschaftliche vernunft weil man ja wei was das kostet
4519801 auch bei den lteren zeichnet sich mehr mobilit t ab
4519802 und das ist die mehrheit der pensionisten die werden sich die programme und versprechen der parteien genau anschauen und sie auf die waagschale legen
4519803 i think it bridges the gap between 2006s the truth and 2003s this is love this is murderous
4519804 the melodies are darker the riffs are heavier we just wrote a really aggressive record that encompasses everything weve ever tried to do as a band and then raised the bar a notch or two
4519805 he is going to be there he will be meeting with political leaders
4519806 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4519807 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine
4519808 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4519809 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4519810 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4519811 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4519812 today paraguay breaks with its reputation for corruption breaks with the few feudal lords of the past
4519813 i call on the government of zimbabwe to fully respect humanitarian principles and the impartiality and neutrality of voluntary and non governmental organisations allowing them to operate freely and with unrestricted access to those in need
4519814 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4519815 it is my conviction that all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4519816 i make a sincere appeal to the people of the state to maintain peace and calm in this difficult hour
4519817 we have limited pitch authority at flight levels were descending to see if we can regain pitch authority
4519818 at this time we would like to declare this an emergency and also have cfr fire and rescue equipment standing by in st louis

4519825 we oppose the grp milf peace panel memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain because it is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was any appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed many if not all of its provisions violate the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4519826 we further strongly oppose provisions in the moa ad granting the milf through the bangsamoro juridical entity bje exclusive ownership over the bangsamoro homeland and removing this area from the public domain
4519827 it inputs will be collated first it is premature to make an initiative while there is an oral argument in the supreme court we are studying the possibility but we are careful not to get into what the judiciary is doing
4519828 there might be something in the decision of the supreme court that will guide us on how to proceed with legal processes to give life to the intent of the moa ad
4519829 as long as there is openness on both sides and as long as there is goodwill and good faith on both sides

4519841 ive never touched a camera before and have no experience handling a camera
4519842 the main difficulties we faced in making this film were asking people to show their faces on camera not being able to guarantee their safety and to gain their consent
4519843 lots of tourists come to lhasa and the chinese government sweet talks them showing them what they want to show

4519850 i felt i had to do things i wouldnt do if i were making the same film in five years
4519851 people putting on 3 d glasses or paying a little extra to see a movie in 3 d at this point in cinema are expecting to have things blatantly launched into the audience
4519852 if the movie takes you somewhere that you dream about going to and probably arent going to get to it belongs in 3 d
4519853 if someone decides they want to do my dinner with andre in 3 d its not for us

4519869 theres a segment of my blog readership that comes from the indie craft world and i see an overlap between people who go to craft fairs and who are lesbian or bisexual

4519914 i just like to spend my sabbath day being with god
4519915 if you want to be with god why dont you go to church it doesnt make sense papa
4519916 god isnt in church much these days son at least i havent seen him there in awhile
4519917 at church preachers preach they were evangelical quakers singers sing prayers pray and gossipers gossip that doesnt leave much time for god to say anything
