1440003 is a very high priority right now and our downtown police deployment is an important part of an effective multi faceted effort
1440004 epd is currently reassigning every available additional hour of patrol officer time to the downtown including officers on foot and bike patrol and i anticipate continuing this deployment for whatever duration is needed to have an impact
1440005 we are seeking every opportunity to expand this effort without adversely affecting the services we provide to the entire community
1440006 if we dont have laws in place now to address these kinds of behaviors then those laws must be enacted this kind of behavior must not be tolerated and it must come to an end
1440007 predicated on a conviction its not a good tool for us at all
1440008 we want to say that enough is enough and that were going to take our downtown back

1440015 i believe the intent was to help schools build all the infrastructure to really address those substantial targets
1440016 by having a staggered approach it allows schools to build the professional learning community and really set up the process of disaggregating the data and addressing student needs
1440017 its just a real narrow slice of our school that didnt meet the new standard the new level
1440018 what bothers me the most is if none of us made it that would be fine but because some schools make it some and one doesnt parents and the community think that one school is better than the other and thats not the case
1440019 it kind of roughed him up a little bit so he has some scratching and stuff to his back

1440043 it think its largely a commodity price story especially as weve seen oil prices start to look like they are on a downward trend
1440044 i think youre seeing some of that strength reverse as a result youre seeing some weakening in commodity based currencies including the canada
1440045 generally were in an environment where the u s dollar seems to be on a bit of an upswing and thats adding further fuel to this depreciating trend for the canada
1440046 just last week we had the monthly gdp contract again so that made it the third of four months that weve seen the canadian economy sort of shrink
1440047 thats shown that the weakness in the u s economy is having a real impact on canadas growth prospects and thats a also a reason that we started to see a bit of underperformance in the dollar
1440048 over the long term it will make manufacturers a little more competitive

1440120 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1440121 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1440122 create a civil action to provide judicial remedies to carry out certain treaty obligations of the united states under the vienna convention on consular relations and the optional protocol to the vienna convention on consular relations
1440123 difficulties attend the notion that due process of law can be embodied in fixed rules
1440124 d ue process unlike some legal rules is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time place and circumstances
1440125 might not automatically become domestic law hardly means the underlying treaty is
1440126 congress is up to the task of implementing non self executing treaties
1440127 the supreme court determined that congress has the legislative authority to authorize the judicial review directed in the avena judgment and to ensure compliance with this legal obligation across the united states
1440128 compliance with the vienna convention is a critical aspect of national security and foreign policy including the reciprocal treatment of u s persons overseas
1440129 examin ing the facts and in particular the prejudice and its causes taking account of the violation of the rights set forth in the convention
1440130 d id not give full and independent weight to the treaty violation which is what avena requires
1440131 t here is no question that if a death sentence were carried out in any of these cases including mr medell ns without the required review and reconsideration this would be inconsistent with the avena judgment
1440132 i t is well settled that the united states interpretation of a treaty is entitled to great weight
1440133 consider whether medellin was prejudiced in any way by the violation of his vienna convention rights
1440134 where a federal court of appeals sua sponte recalls its mandate to revisit the merits of an earlier decision denying habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner the court abuses its discretion unless it acts to avoid a miscarriage of justice as defined by our habeas corpus jurisprudence
1440135 congress has not hesitated to pass implementing legislation for treaties that in its view require such legislation
1440136 the constitution which provides for this has done so foolish a thing as to leave it in the power of the states to pass laws whose enforcement renders the general government liable to just reclamations which it must answer while not prohibit ing to the states the acts for which the united states is held responsible

1440155 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you
1440156 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
1440157 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
1440158 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
1440159 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
1440160 then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life

1440235 el chorro de mentiras y calumnias que verti en su lenguaje torpe odioso y repugnante solo puede compararse con el chorro enorme de sangre joven y limpia que desde la noche antes estaba derramando con su consentimiento complicidad y aplauso las m s desalmada turba de asesinos que pueda concebirse jam s
1440236 no ten a ni siquiera en aquellos momentos la esperanza de marcarle sobre la frente miserable la verdad que lo estigmatice por el resto de los d as y el resto de los tiempos porque sobre nosotros se cerraba ya el cerco de m s de mil hombres con armas de mayor alcance y potencia cuya consigna terminante era regresar con nuestros cad veres
1440237 sin embargo en aras de la verdad la mitad del grueso de nuestras fuerzas y la mejor armada por un error lamentable se extravi a la entrada de la ciudad y nos falt en el momento decisivo
1440238 la mentira del mill n no pod a ser m s absurda si con menos de 20 000 pesos armamos 165 hombres y atacamos un regimiento con un mill n de pesos hubi ramos podido armar 8 000 hombres atacar 50 regimientos 50 escuadrones y ugalde carrillo no se habr a enterado hasta el domingo 26 de julio a las 5 15 de la ma ana
1440239 no fue nunca el tirano batista un hombre de escr pulos que vacilara antes de decir al pueblo la m s fant stica mentira asever fidel
1440240 qu poco respeto se le tiene a un pueblo cuando se le trata de enga ar tan miserablemente
1440241 cre an haber enga ado al pueblo en sus mentiras y ellos mismos terminaron enga ndose
1440242 los pueblos poseen una l gica sencilla pero implacable mi l gica es la l gica sencilla del pueblo los culpables siguen libres con su arma en la mano que es amenaza perenne para la vida de los ciudadanos
1440243 se sabe que fue agust n d az cartaya compa ero asaltante del moncada quien a solicitud de fidel compuso el himno del 26 de julio
1440244 despu s del asesinato de los moncadistas prisioneros para hacer ver que hab an ca do combatiendo hubo que variar la letra y ponerle
1440245 el himno fue cantado por los asaltantes en una de las sesiones del juicio por los sucesos de aquella gesta en la c rcel de boniato y esa fue la primera vez que rindi sus frutos su primer golpe digamos
1440246 yo supe por una charla de la hero na del moncada melba hern ndez que fidel mientras conduc a el auto en m xico le pidi a ella que le cantara el himno porque lo estimulaba lo entusiasmaba le infund a m s fe en la victoria alimentaba su esp ritu revolucionario
1440247 algunos compa eros de la sierra maestra le contaron c mo el texto del himno en un papel mimeografiado se pasaba de una mano en otra entre los rebeldes quienes incluso lo cantaban en determinados momentos previos o durante los combates en voz alta o en voz baja pero que siempre los emocionaba y los impulsaba hacia el triunfo
1440248 pero todo eso era casi desconocido por los luchadores clandestinos en nuestras ciudades
1440249 faustino le dijo que ya ese himno exist a y lo que faltaba era grabarlo en un disco para que el pueblo lo conociera bien y lo cantara
1440250 todo eso lo supe porque faustino con quien me hab a vinculado en ciertas actividades revolucionarias me mand a decir con dos compa eros que viera con carlos faxas la tarea que deb a cumplir con l y era precisamente la de grabar el himno
1440251 faxas cuando salimos una tarde del canal 4 rumbo al teatro am rica me dijo que la misi n encargada por faustino era grabar el himno por supuesto le dije que s
1440252 faustino le dijo a carlos que contactara con antonio garc a tambi n miembro del 26 de julio due o de un negocio de venta de discos de m sica sudamericana para buscar los t cnicos necesarios y el lugar donde hacer la importante grabaci n y r pidamente
1440253 enrique herrera tambi n integrante de nuestro cuarteto estuvo de acuerdo en ser una de las voces y ya ramos tres los enrolados en esta hermosa tarea despu s faxas habl con una compa era de la ortodoxia y ella sugiri utilizar como cantante a su sobrina sonia de arag n que era su nombre art stico en los clubes de la habana y se integr una cuarta persona para cantar man n d asper
1440254 antonio garc a logr que grab ramos el himno en una de las cabinas de radio cadena habana que entonces estaba en prado y san jos en la habana vieja a un costado del capitolio un sitio a donde el cuarteto de carlos faxas no hab a ido en ninguna otra ocasi n
1440255 nos pusimos de acuerdo para no llegar todo juntos con el fin de no llamar mucho la atenci n
1440256 cuando est bamos llegando vimos a uno de los m sicos parado en la puerta de la emisora esper ndonos porque ramos los nicos que falt bamos y nos hizo se a para que nos baj ramos
1440257 hab a un gran movimiento de polic as marineros soldados y era que en los altos de donde est bamos la esposa del tirano marta fern ndez compart a reunida con unas mujeres en una especie de fiesta de ah ese trasiego de militares en los alrededores
1440258 uno de los t cnicos nos pidi que le pag ramos el trabajo que iba a hacer pues ten a varios hijos y lo necesitaba le dijimos que s pero que nadie pod a enterarse de lo que har amos en ese estudio si nos delataba ir amos a buscarlo debajo de la tierra pero el hombre se port bien y mantuvo el secreto
1440259 los cantantes ramos enrique herrera man n d asper sonia de arag n y yo
1440260 y al d a siguiente empezamos a vender los discos en cinco pesos cada uno con dos objetivos que el pueblo lo conociera y pudiera aprend rselo y recaudar fondos para la lucha
1440261 no puedo dejar de mencionar que carlos faxas cay preso su esposa carmita me llam por tel fono y me lo dijo pens que era por lo del himno y fue porque el movimiento 26 de julio hizo un sabotaje en la feria agropecuaria de rancho boyeros a la que ir a el dictador
1440262 quise irme para matanzas con el prop sito de que no me capturaran pero me orientaron ir a la prensa y denunciar el apresamiento de faxas de manera de que no lo fueran a matar irremediablemente
1440263 no era por el himno sino porque le hallaron f sforo vivo que yo le hab a dado para aquella acci n en boyeros
1440264 carlos tuvo que irse para miami hasta all le mandamos dos discos del himno uno de ellos a trav s de rodr guez curbelo se envi a venezuela y de all a la sierra maestra que un d a escuch en la radio rebelde con enorme emoci n
1440265 por cierto hay algo asombroso realmente en una gira art stica en indonesia al principio de la revoluci n un coro japon s cant el himno del 26 de julio por la directora supe que lo llevaron porque era en ese momento el n mero musical m s importante en el mundo
1440266 si no renuncian en pleno todos los magistrados me apiado de vuestras honras y compadezco la mancha sin precedente que caer sobre el poder judicial
1440267 ext2 nallez pas me mettre de la journalisation sur une clef usb
1440268 the industry is reaching a point where delivering an acceptable level of security today is beyond what one company can do alone wrote microsofts andrew cushman in the blogs inaugural post
1440269 theres real merit in the clich it takes a village
1440270 think of it as community based defense where we commit our skills and strengths to defend beyond our boundaries to protect our common customers
1440271 you cant put a grade on products and services from a security standpoint
1440272 the best thing you can do is get the information out
1440273 theres definitely no end point to security so i think that whatever is done to foster collaboration is a step in the right direction
1440274 were launching two additional cloud computing centers and one of them is going to be an extremely large cloud computing center the largest that weve launched to date
1440275 both new facilities are examples of how were investing hundreds of millions of dollars to create extremely efficient datacenters based on cloud technologies and our enterprise architecture which weve instantiated in other cloud computing efforts
1440276 from a consumer perspective looking at it from the different use cases that are coming about you see the growth of these huge web 2 0 applications out there as well as the emergence of a huge mobile user base these applications require large amounts of compute resources just to handle the number of users because with the web 2 0 phenomenon people are actually contributing content back to these sites
1440277 its not to say that everybody is going to be exactly like youtube but even with a bank a user consuming your service could be a person standing on the side of the street hitting the refresh button on their stock ticker or account balance or whatever
1440278 thats going to create huge demand on the systems that are running these applications so it isnt just about back end data processing we want to talk about supporting lots of different types of workloads both user based workloads and back end based workloads
1440279 the thing thats really compelling about the cloud model when its used either internally or externally is that there are levels of efficiency that one is able to get that you just cant get with conventional data centers over time even internal datacenters will migrate more and more to a cloud approach where they adopt cloud principles such as virtualization
1440280 the software in these cloud datacenters is composed of a number of our tivoli products including a request driven provisioning product we also use a lot of xen but were able to use other virtualization technologies such as vmware too
1440281 customers arent going to be ripping out datacenters and replacing them with cloud centers overnight this is going to be a gradual process
1440282 its going to be a hybrid model with both internal and external clouds
1440283 create s a new opportunity to shape the relationship between those who use it services and those who sell them
1440284 obviously there are the early adopters who are out there playing with it right now but most of the world is trying to figure out what to do with it what it means what the value to them is going to be
1440285 at share were trying to introduce the technology the options get people into that planning phase get them better able to understand what it is theyre talking about
1440286 the idea of bigger clouds that transcend an individual organizations boundaries and kind of go to this notion of true utility computing is probably still a little further out
1440287 right now were trying to bring the discussion into the share audience start to expose people to what its all about get them prepared for when the cios says i want my own cloud because she read about it in an airline magazine or something like that
1440288 the white part is hard plastic and the blue surface which sits on the quilt is sort of dense foam but with enough texture that it grips the fabric i know it simply doesnt seem like itd be a big deal but they make machine quilting way easier you dont need to grip or wear gloves or clutch at the fabric

1440291 i wish that polensek had george zeller providing him information on why rta is proposing
1440292 i should have mentioned those two cities in question with newhouse owned papers new orleans and
1440293 note that two of the three cities you mention ed have newhouse owned newspapers which have

1440300 what does patton have to do with what i usually write about
1440301 the ministry will examine the order of the specially designated tribuanl in detail and take remedial action on a priority basis
1440302 upa has been incompetent in defending the ban on simi this reflects the real face of the government and its soft attitude towards terrorism
1440303 this is what the seva dal activists will wear when they are out to do public service it is an addition not a change
1440304 this is the cap when the seva dal people are working in a disaster zone

1440307 they contacted the passport office but were sent to the japanese embassy but the japanese embassy says till an indian court does not give them custody of the child a passport cannot be issued
1440308 there are no laws governing surrogacy in india we need a law so that children dont suffer like this
1440309 the public understands that youth in trouble with the law are not lost and that working with them to solve problems is a better approach to public safety than just locking them up

1440312 seramai 1 000 tetamu terdiri daripada saudara mara rakan rakan artis dan media telah dijemput menghadiri majlis berkenaan
1440313 bagaimanapun saya tetap menggunakan khidmat seorang penterjemah pada majlis itu nanti
1440314 kalau berlesen saya boleh bantu berunding memanjangkan tempoh pinjaman manakala jika tidak berlesen sukar untuk kita buat sesuatu kerana mereka tidak terima penjelasan
1440315 anda semua ah long jangan melampaui batas amaran saya jelas sasaran anda ialah pemiutang dan jangan susahkan isteri wan nor azlin dan anak anaknya

1440317 keadaan ini menuntut negara menyediakan dasar dan strategi khusus agar pertumbuhan ekonomi dapat dikekalkan sebagaimana yang disasarkan inflasi adalah terkawal dan rakyat dapat terus menikmati kehidupan yang berkualiti terutama bagi golongan yang tidak berkemampuan
1440318 saya sebut dua contoh sebagai usaha memberi tambahan pendapatan kepada golongan berpendapatan rendah dan petani seperti memberi benih dan pokok buah buahan ini antara langkah yang diambil pihak swasta syarikat lain boleh membantu cara lain
1440319 yang kedua ialah berkaitan bas untuk kenderaan awam sekarang minyak sudah naik keinginan untuk guna bas semakin meningkat dan tambang bas mungkin lebih murah lagi berbanding guna kereta
1440320 misalnya sebuah syarikat swasta beli bas dan serah kepada sebuah agensi di johor mereka tolong ambil dua pemandu ambil satu bas memberi perkhidmatan dan bantuan minyak jadi rakyat akan dapat tambang percuma atau bayar sedikit sahaja
1440321 memang kerajaan menggalakkan kita membincangkan perkara yang mempunyai kesan kepada rakyat tetapi kalau ia boleh menimbulkan salah faham dan menyentuh perasaan kaum atau penganut agama lain saya fikir ia perlu dielakkan
1440322 soal berkenaan agama adalah perkara yang cukup sensitif di negara ini jangan fikir dalam melaksanakan hak kita orang lain tidak mempunyai hak
1440323 justeru majlis peguam perlu menggunakan pendekatan bijaksana dan kewarasan kerana ia menjadi penentu kepada ketenteraman di negara ini
1440324 poor cindy mccain poor johnny theyre just too damn busy and too rich to get any accountant on their payroll that would actually take care of the detail of paying property taxes i just do not buy this i have no wiggle room on this whatsoever none four freakin years pause thats a character flaw that is clearly the actions of an elitist and it certainly doesnt qualify someone to be in the highest land in the office
1440325 how many years do you have to go before there is a clear and distinct attitude approach and measure of operation where we can make the determination they had no freakin intention of paying these taxes none ah dont worry about it we get big bucks were in the senate we can handle this thats fraud thats what that is that is outright fraud its a character flaw its the actions of an elitist and it shows a lack of paying attention to detail and a lack of concern
1440326 this is undoubtedly an effort ah just give em the finger we aint paying it were the mccains am i wrong on this how else do we interpret this
1440327 i can guarantee if you want to talk about distinguished service theres no comparison between wesley clark and john mccain
1440328 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1440329 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1440330 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
1440331 to keep inflation expectations anchored means that monetary policy makers will have to back up their words with actions
1440332 we will need to reverse course i anticipate the reversal will need to be started sooner rather than later
1440333 we cant wait until we clearly observe the financial markets at normal the
1440334 were pretty well positioned for the downside risks we might encounter from here i worry a little bit more about the prospects for inflation
1440335 it will be important for the federal reserve to monitor inflation developments and inflation expectations closely and to move to a less accommodative stance in a timely fashion
1440336 when to begin this process and how fast to move will be difficult decisions
1440337 while a 2 percent federal funds rate may be appropriate in a period of extreme economic weakness if maintained for too long it could allow inflationary pressures to build over time
1440338 i couldnt agree with you more that inflation is a tax and that inflation currently is too high and its a top priority of the federal reserve to run a policy thats going to bring inflation to an acceptable level
1440339 the housing market is really the central element of this financial crisis and anything we can do to strengthen the housing market to strengthen mortgage finance would be beneficial
1440340 the possibility of higher energy prices tighter credit conditions and a still deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth at the same time upside risks to inflation outlook have intensified lately
1440341 many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress in part because the outlook for the economy and thus for credit quality remains uncertain helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority
1440342 i think were looking at the remainder of the year being probably positive growth but certainty not robust growth
1440343 i am somewhat reassured by the recent data which suggest that my biggest fears on the downside have so far been avoided however a few months of data dont make a trend
1440344 we are currently monitoring developments in financial markets closely and considering several options including extending the duration of our facilities for primary dealers beyond year end should the current unusual and exigent circumstances continue to prevail in dealer funding markets
1440345 it could happen that we find it necessary to raise rates even if
1440346 that is a possibility it is something that we need to be prepared to do
1440347 on a continuum i would say things are shifting to somewhat more inflation risks
1440348 the risks to inflation are likely not symmetric and they have definitely increased we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop
1440349 it is hurting fed credibility to say that we are trying to keep inflation low and stable but at the same time we are not counting some of the prices that are going up at the most rapid pace
1440350 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1440351 the federal reserve went for the jugular by indicating increased concern about inflation even though the most recent set of economic data and developments in the financial markets signals relief on the inflation front this may worry those who would rather the fed back away from any inclination toward interest rate hikes and possibly move toward interest rate cuts but it is probably the best thing for the economy and the financial markets because it will help kick inflation while its down or moving down and lower the chances at a revival at both the decline in the value of the dollar and the rally in commodity prices
1440352 the dollar is retreating a little bit and the stock market is rallying because there was only one dissenter as opposed to what was feared to be two
1440353 they continue to be preoccupied with housing and credit conditions they tweaked their labour market assessment to say it has softened further right now the question is whether the bond market is going to further scale down its expectations further of rate hikes this year i am expecting rate cuts and we are slowly moving in that direction overall this is a slightly less hawkish statement than the previous one i would call it a discrete move back to neutral
1440354 in some ways it was a little surprising they were not more hawkish on the inflation side of things maybe they are a bit more optimistic on what oil prices have been doing i dont think it the feds rate decision and statement will have a huge effect on bonds
1440355 if anything they seem to be a little more worried about the growth side
1440356 its no surprise they stayed where they are our expectation is they wont change anything until at least march of next year and depending on growth it could go longer than that
1440357 i expected them to make a strong statement about inflation expectations and theyve done that they actually commented on the rise in expectations among consumers thats their concern that they were to come unglued
1440358 its interesting to me that they comment that the current actions promote moderate growth they have been scaling back their growth expectations and they sort of intimate that when the temporary stimulus passes growth might be a little lower before picking up again
1440359 the fact that theyre talking about moderate economic growth as opposed to strong economic growth and they do reference the ongoing drag on housing simply says that theyre not expecting a rapid recovery
1440360 there are not any surprises here they are trying to navigating a very tough climate in this
1440361 in the short term its hard to envision this scenario of a rate hike for that to happen you would need to see things improving significantly the labour market remains a wildcard at this time there are other headwinds such as tight credit conditions
1440362 you will have a dissent going forward to underscore their concerns about inflation its indicative of the open atmosphere at the federal reserve at this time
1440363 i dont think theyre saying anything new i think the oil price move lower gives them the ability to hold rates steady without sacrificing too much in terms of the dollars recent strength
1440364 i also think weakening european economy gives them room to hold steady if inflation moderates you can keep rates lower its good to keep rates lower because that helps repair the balance sheets of the u s banks
1440365 the stock market had a substantial upward move very quickly after the announcement profit taking alleviated the upward pressure and returned the benchmarks back to their pre announcement levels the fed basically is concerned about inflation and the slowing economy and apparently feels that taking no action at this time is better than making a change in monetary policy they did note that they stand ready to make a decision on interest rates if necessary
1440366 the big news for the market almost more than the fomc is oil
1440367 the fed needs to avoid the risks japan faced in the early 1990s so i wanted to see that it had maximized flexibility in all three areas growth inflation and credit by referring to all three things it emphasized that it remains flexible i would contrast this with the ecbs recent statements the decision not to raise rates was the correct one and it has given itself room to act according to what needed the stock market may be encouraged a bit by the fact that there was only one dissent
1440368 you shouldnt have to offer a reward for someone to come forward after the death of such a beautiful girl everyone loved her
1440369 my greatest fear is that we do find this murderer and that greatest fear is we find out because hes done this to somebody else
1440370 at this stage there is insufficient evidence to satisfy a jury beyond reasonable doubt that a known person has committed an indictable offence
1440371 it is understood the nsw police will continue to investigate fresh evidence into ms childs death
1440372 the police investigation in the early period following ms childs death unfortunately was not able to capture some items of evidence no longer available to the current investigating police
1440373 i have been involved with the kidzwish foundation since 2006 and i think it is really important that we have a charity that specifically helps illawarra children
1440374 the nsw government has supported the kidzwish foundation for the past three years and is always happy to help these very special kids
1440375 there were some mother daughter disagreements youre not doing that ill do what i like sort of thing
1440376 we were called by kings cross police one night just before she disappeared theyd picked her up
1440377 i brought her home i got up the next morning and she was gone
1440378 she came back four days later went to stay at her grandparents at fairy meadow and disappeared from there
1440379 myself and my ex husband tanyas father we scoured kings cross oxford st all those different places we havent seen or heard from her since
1440380 night after night i think she cant be deceased they dont just grab bodies and put them in the ground but what if she died in hospital under another name
1440381 if i die i want to die knowing its ended that shes either been put to rest or shes been found
1440382 i want her to know that i love her and i want to hear anything
1440383 i think there is the ability to open it up to traffic and retain it as a meeting place and a safe area to shop
1440384 it is not being used to its fullest potential and when you have development on the other side of the road it is going to look like an eyesore
1440385 gpt believes the refurbishment and improvement to crown st will help realise its potential as the premier main high street of retail and commerce activity for the illawarra region
1440386 signed by the president and prime minister nouri al maliki which intended to do away with past un sponsored status of forces agreements normally renewed on a yearly basis
1440387 it would be the ultimate irony about standing up for democracy in iraq if we were to wind up coaching the iraqi executive on how to skirt its own parliament
1440388 well im sure they are watching and im glad they finally have a chance to see you mr addington
1440389 when youre dealing with offshore drilling youre dealing with local government who takes all your rents as opposed to opec and its a lot more friendly turf
1440390 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1440391 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
1440392 i strongly disagree with his politics and would like the opportunity to sit down and have a brother to brother talk with the man concerning his stance on
1440393 i cannot do my duty well by the country if i concentrate only on telling troops of non violence all the time subordinating their main task of preparing themselves efficiently to be good soldiers so i ask you please to give me the childs guide to knowledge tell me please how i can put this over that is the spirit of non violence to the troops without endangering their sense of duty to train thmeselves well professionally as soldiers

1440424 the consensus email across america to this program is if obama doesnt want the republicans to pick on his wife then let her stay home in the kitchen and not make speeches on the stump
1440425 now if youre elected president of the united states you know what im saying i mean isnt this kind of a whether its the clintons or not
1440426 and so i think that barack obama may be a little bit sensitive in this arena
1440427 now do i agree with the nasty 527 stuff thats out there the twisting of the comments and the patriotic but i really think that barack was a little sensitive when he said lay off my wife you know thats like saying well then dont believe her when shes on the stump and i think this is a very fair approach to all of this i do believe that criticism of a spouse is fair game if its not dirtball politics i mean if its a fact its a fact

1440434 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1440435 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1440436 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1440437 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1440438 why did you decide to endorse obama and why are you doing it now

1440440 if john mccain seriously believes we are at war with al qaeda in iraq that alone is such a serious error in judgment as to rank him with george w bush at his worst and therefore disqualify him from any chance to govern this country

1440456 food is such a basic need that you can see people really going to great lengths
1440457 that might lead to various distress responses one of which on the part of women is having transactional sex to feed their kids
1440458 recent studies in botswana swaziland malawi zambia and tanzania have shown associations between acute food insecurity and unprotected transactional sex among poor women
1440459 the debate is now over which non combatant branches or arms women can get permanent commission in the chiefs of staff committee comprising army navy and iaf chiefs will take a final decision on this within a month or two defense minister a k antony is keen on it
1440460 once permanent commission for women is decided modalities about training at military academies will be worked out it will be an open competition there will be no reservation or quotas in theory an entire nda batch could be of women
1440461 there were cultural adjustments needed when women were first inducted but women have not been found to be unsuitable in anyway i am sure even women fighter pilots will be a reality in the future
1440462 there are physical toughness physiological and practical issues can women be deployed in bunkers along the loc or chase terrorists can you imagine a woman in the hands of an enemy or a terrorist our society is simply not ready for it
1440463 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea

1440471 older adults who consumed tuna or other baked or broiled fish had a lower risk of having abnormalities on brain mris
1440472 this study looked at whether or not different types of fish intake were related to structural changes in the brain
1440473 we didnt find any association with eating fried fish and having lower rates of these abnormalities
1440474 the message to the public is to eat more fish that has higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids rather than eating more fried fish
1440475 this may be related to the more than one factor analogous to the mediterranean diet that is also rich in fish and fruits and vegetables and has been frequently associated with less cardiovascular risk
1440476 while we have some issues with the cameras shooting performance mainly with the ridiculous buffer flush times this camera still offers great image quality awesome high iso performance nice video results and a very intelligent and useful smart capture mode
1440477 the good brilliant color reproduction hd video capture sleek design
1440478 the s1000fd is obviously aimed at serious shooters but it lacks some of the basic features that a photography enthusiast would expect manual color saturation and contrast adjustments for instance plus it doesnt provide image stabilization this puts the camera in something of a bind the s1000fd doesnt really measure up for the serious creative photography demographic but it is too complex and difficult to use for the casual shutterbug and point and shoot crowd
1440479 the finepix s1000fd might offer a 12x optical zoom and the promise of a stack of features to help you take better pictures but we struggled to feel the effect owners manual
1440480 yeah there were some things like you couldnt have more than three enemies on the screen at once so we had to make sure that thats how it stayed in our game in the part with the dragon with the flame there should be flickering and whatnot

1440482 give to caesar what is caesars and to god what is gods
1440483 if you dont know what the historical implications are what the definition of appeasement is in our nations history its a bad idea very bad to come on with chris matthews and try to make the argument that somehow barack obama and the democrats are appeasers just like the way just like they were with nazi germany with na velle chamberlain and nazi germany if you dont know anything about na velle chamberlain and dont know anything about the history of nazi germany very very bad idea to come on and to make that point
1440484 it is such an outrageous and such a bizarre comment for
1440485 secondly its so bizarre for a president to give this kind of political speech on foreign soil
1440486 the use of a single one size fits all value for the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 obscures important differences associated with transmission cofactors perhaps more importantly the particular value of 0001 i e one infection per 1000 contacts between infected and uninfected individuals that is commonly used seems to represent a lower bound as such this value substantially underestimates the infectivity of hiv 1 in many heterosexual contexts heterosexual infectivity can exceed 01 one transmission per 10 contacts for penile vaginal contact or even 03 one transmission per three contacts for penile anal contact claims in both the popular media and the peer reviewed literature that hiv is very difficult to transmit heterosexually are dangerous in any context where the possibility of hiv exposure exists
1440487 improved infectivity estimates especially more detailed estimates that quantify the amplifying effects of biological cofactors will help us to grasp the magnitude of the hiv epidemic accurately communicate the level of risk involved in heterosexual sex and identify the best possible intervention strategies for slowing the epidemics spread
1440488 infectivity studies are very difficult to conduct and that few studies exist as a result many of the studies producing the published estimates suffered from at least one potential bias therefore while our study documents the considerable heterogeneity of the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 and provides some explanations for this heterogeneity considerable uncertainty remains

1440550 racistvania is that what we should call that state heres whats shaking barack obama does well in rural areas like kansas and minnesota and north dakota and idaho and utah but all of a sudden in texas and ohio and in pennsylvania something happened its called rev wright and its called guns and the small town comment which was twisted and it also the addition of joe scarborough onto the hillary clinton staff certainly has had something to do with it too
1440551 we in pennsylvania feel were pretty liberal and you know dont feel that we should be claimed as racists because we voted for hillary over obama
1440552 you know i agree with you carl i know what youre saying but why did your governor ed rendell go so far as to say that some white folks arent ready to vote for an african american candidate he said that i didnt
1440553 im not here to defend what ed rendell would say were the voters of pennsylvania and we voted on what we believe is the best candidate and who we believe is the best candidate you know i dont hear you saying that obamas campaign is being supported by racist blacks when hes winning the black vote some 80 percent to somewhere in the teens for hillary
1440554 oh ive said all along that the black folks are going to
1440555 but are these people racist because they voted that way
1440556 uh well i think you could say that the religious zealots went with george bush
1440557 also commit now publicly to wall to wall coverage of what will undoubtedly be the media firestorm over whether or not john mccains wife saying shes angry means that the american people will accept her as first lady just like the coverage over whether or not barack obamas wife michelle is unsuited for first lady because she said that shes angry sometimes those will get totally equal coverage right the white lady saying shes angry is just as controversial just as politically salient right as the black lady saying shes angry isnt it arent you just racing for the coverage of cindy mccains politically unpalatable anger
1440558 i appreciate your effort to extend your exclusive story but weve said all we are going to say about that and i say that as a proud member as moveon org
1440559 we have been less successful in caucuses because it brings out the activist base of the democratic party moveon didnt even want us to go into afghanistan emphasis added i mean thats what were dealing with and you know they turn out in great numbers and they are very driven by their view of our positions and its primarily national security and foreign policy that drives them i dont agree with them they know i dont agree with them
1440560 im curious though what part of our foreign policy approach doesnt she agree with the ending the war in iraq part
1440561 weve said all we are going to say about your story
1440562 proof that the karl rove playbook has become the msms bible

1440565 moveon org endorsed sen barack obama which is like a gusher of money that never seems to slow down
1440566 we have been less successful in caucuses because it brings out the activist base of the democratic party moveon didnt even want us to go into afghanistan i mean thats what were dealing with and you know they turn out in great numbers and they are very driven by their view of our positions and its primarily national security and foreign policy that drives them i dont agree with them they know i dont agree with them so they flood into these caucuses and dominate them and really intimidate people who actually show up to support me
1440567 the organization was created specifically to help her husband bill clinton survive impeachment for getting you know what moveons eli pariser responded
1440568 senator clinton has her facts wrong again moveon never opposed the war in afghanistan and we set the record straight years ago when karl rove made the same claim senator clintons attack on our members is divisive at a time when democrats will soon need to unify to beat senator mccain moveon is 3 2 million reliable voters and volunteers who are an important part of any winning democratic coalition in november they deserve better than to be dismissed using republican talking points
1440569 este gui n si fue un dolor de cabeza ehh trat ndose de comedia y si tomamos en cuenta el proceso por el que est atravesando mi vida era dif cil yo me compromet a terminar el gui n y cuando nos dimos cuenta est bamos a una semana de empezar el rodaje
1440570 sab amos como terminaba la historia ya tenia m s del 60 del gui n
1440571 de repente se abri espacio un d a y aproveche ese d a que todos los astros estuvieron a favor de mi cabeza y lo parimos lo terminamos de escribir y lo interesante es que no hubo una correcci n posterior
1440572 este no es el primer largometraje que escrib el primer largometraje se llama wacho cuando hicimos el presupuesto nos dimos cuenta que wacho para hacerlo bien costaba una barbaridad
1440573 xavier escribe algo que sea de bajo presupuesto ok cuales son los par metros una sola locaci n un solo cambio de ropa un elenco inferior en cantidad al elenco del primer proyecto y as nace nada personal en una conversaci n con charlie a fines del mes de mayo

1440576 es una pareja que en realidad no tienen problemas pero todo lo que sucede durante ese partido de f tbol en el departamento es lo que nos muestra lo vulnerable que es esa relaci n todo lo que puede sucederle a un matrimonio en 50 a os les sucede a ellos en dos horas
1440577 esta es una pel cula que se basa en las relaciones personales y mi manera de demostrarle a la audiencia lo vulnerable que son esas relaciones a todas las influencias externas a las que est n expuestas
1440578 es ese estilo de comedia que aqu no se ha hecho un sentido del humor que se diluyo y es una pena porque hay un p blico dispuesto a consumir eso el cine te da muchas libertades ustedes mismos acaban de presenciar una escena pueden opinar
1440579 en televisi n no podr a hacer eso pero ahora para el cine bueno nos van a tener que ir a ver mayores de 18 a os pero es un lenguaje real el ecuatoriano es muy mal hablado en general pero eso es lo que queremos mostrar algo real
1440580 lo que buscamos es contar una historia nueva una comedia comercial que sea gil que la gente la crea que diga bueno eso me puede pasar romper estos esquemas de cine intelectual de poca que son interesantes pero que no nos divierte utiliza el termino divierte queriendo decir un cine que nos haga reir y eso es lo que queremos que el p blico se divierta

1440587 to succeed in meeting our customers demand for energy and expectations regarding reliability we need to attract and retain new engineering talent
1440588 by supporting a new power engineering program in the college of engineering we have an opportunity to help prepare a new crop of power engineers and stimulate innovative research in our field this program will benefit other providers of energy services as well as energy consumers in mining oil gas and other industries
1440589 over the past 25 years power systems programs have almost disappeared from us universities that and other factors have caused a critical workforce shortage the us department of labor predicts that by 2012 there will be about 10 000 more jobs in power engineering than people available to fill them
1440590 degrees in engineering at the university of utah have increased more than 65 percent since the start of the initiative adding a power systems program to our existing strengths in clean affordable energy development will help all industries

1440596 beyond work my summer started off ostensibly good in my personal life kevin and i hit the gay scene in nyc pretty hard i especially was really popular at a few of the clubs and got hit on relentlessly after about four weeks of this though it got really goddamn old i dont care if boys think im attractive i want them to care about my aspirations and happiness frankly i think all the attention for my physical properties makes kevin respect me a lot less he may say he likes it and encourage it but im sure it compromised any chance i ever had which i didnt of having a lasting meaningful relationship with him already im refusing to go out and he seems bored with my cynical approach to life in nyc ive given up drinking in any quantities over a single drink with dinner which makes it hard to be a party boy
1440597 i stupidly compromised a lasting friendship with you to pursue what is seemingly a shallow relationship with someone else i dont doubt that you felt extremely hurt by this and it is something i have regretted every day since you broke contact with me p s i still havent moved on emotionally he hasnt realized it but i am so very unavailable emotionally at this time

1440646 axis fa ade it might be quite an exciting structure the perceptual color shifts bring to mind josef albers but it has been quite a while since ive examined his color theories it strikes me as a somewhat academic painting a word that is bound to raise hackles when i use the term i simply mean it is a well executed professionally competent painting by an obviously well schooled artist what is missing for me is inspiration and individuality but i say that guardedly giving the limitations of viewing a single work as a digital image in other words im not contemplating the real thing and there is no substitute for that experience on the subject of limitations i might mention my own as a reviewer i am a photographer who works for the most part figuratively it is ironic that i get an abstract work to review as i submitted an abstract piece myself mostly out of curiosity to see what reaction i would get as abstraction is not my usual m tier my own taste in art leans towards the figurative although i appreciate mark rothko barnett newman and robert motherwell gene davis and i were good friends and often discussed the shifts in perception caused by his use of color stripes i also appreciated the subtle color shifts in the work of the minimalist sculptor painter ann truitt i indulge myself with this name dropping not my usual practice to show i am not totally unfamiliar with color abstraction but another perhaps more serious limitation is that i am mildly color blind and sometimes confuse subtle shades of red and green although with axis i had no trouble distinguishing the greens from the reds and oranges but with this work color shifts are everything and even the possibility that i am seeing different shades of color than the less impaired viewer would rule me out a reviewer of this work in other words had i been professionally assigned to review this artists work i would have probably recused myself i am sorry to go on at such length about myself but i thought the artist would appreciate the context of my comments on his or her art which when all is said and done i would like to see more of you and you acrylic on canvas over wood 5 1 2

1440708 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1440709 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1440712 ian i for one totally agree with everything you have said you only have to look at some of the replies to your rant to see how out of touch a lot of anarchists are the problem with most revolutionaries myself included in my own way is that we have liberated ourselves at least mentally from capitalist culture to such a degree that in the process we have become distanced from the mass of people we most need to activate politically youve bought this up before ian but until we truely come up with some realistic ideas of our own that both give people hope and confront social problems now with some sort of immediately implementable solutions we will be playing knee jerk reaction politics and chasing our own tails forever

1440719 here now you dont need to waste my text messages
1440720 since you like purple so much look inside the bag
1440721 the sentence is clearly not robust enough for the crime and the failure to provide a package of care completely inappropriate
1440722 you were found guilty of the culpable homicide of your wife who you were together with for many years
1440723 in normal circumstances this would attract a prison sentence in double figures
1440724 i have read and considered a number of reports from experts it is plain to me that if i were to impose that sort of sentence you would be released in a very short time because prison would not be able to cope with your condition
1440725 sentencing you would just be a token gesture i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty
1440726 you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives
1440727 not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long
1440728 this is clearly a very difficult case in which there has been a mental illness involved
1440729 however the real issue here is that the sentence has not been robust enough to protect the public from him doing anything similar again
1440730 there has been no effort to provide any kind of appropriate care package to deal with this mans mental health condition
1440731 a restriction of liberty order is clearly inappropriate in a case as serious as this
1440732 its a quite shocking sentence for a crime like this
1440733 there are obviously a lot of people with dementia who are being treated in prison although we dont know how serious his condition is
1440734 the whole issue of the provision of care for dementia sufferers needs to be looked at in the light of this case as there would clearly be issues if he was to be treated in a care home
1440735 im not entirely sure what the best sentence for this individual would be but its certainly not appropriate for him to receive a restriction of liberty order
1440736 the report prepared for the court paints a picture of a man in significant physical and mental decline
1440737 there is a clear diagnosis of dementia setting in it is a progressive condition and ultimately he will need 24 hour care
1440738 i am deeply conscious there has been a death here but this man is very unwell
1440739 he was always willing to plead guilty to culpable homicide but this was flatly rejected by the crown and that is why a trial was necessary
1440740 it must have been me there are no ghosts running about the house who would have done that
1440741 blocked inas killing out of his memory because it was so dreadful
1440742 we never comment on specific cases but at the end of the day the only people who can provide sensible judgment on a case are those who hold all the relevant evidence
1440743 we do definitely have prisoners with dementia although its not possible to say exactly how many we have people in our prisons with all manner of medical conditions the only exceptions would be those people with terminal illness who have a few months to live that are better suited to hospital treatment
1440744 there are a lot of dementia sufferers who are not violent and there may be questions about how to deal with this individual if he does not adhere to his restriction of liberty order
1440745 the key thing in this particular case is that the judge has seen all the relevant medical reports i am satisfied that the normal sentencing considerations could not be applied
1440746 um wait a minute there are hundreds of families out there who would like to adopt me and i would prefer that you not vaccum out my brains just yet
1440747 lets sit down and have tea with iran im sure we can fix it all with some conversation
1440748 i was concerned after the last game that they were already in beijing
1440749 theyll be ok but obviously this was not a good performance
1440750 the three days that we can have practice in beijing have to be three good practice days in order to get us going because weve been playing outstanding basketball and tonight i didnt think we played very well
1440751 id be much happier if we had played great but id be sadder if we lost
1440752 i think a lot of teams get intimidated by that team but basketball around the world is getting stronger on paper they are a lock but i dont know
1440753 i dont think theyve been a lock for the last eight years thats nothing against them thats just a credit to everyone else around the world every now and again some people are going to catch up
1440754 we made them take a lot of contested shots we didnt give them anything easily and theyre the best athletes in the world so we wanted to try to make them beat us from the perimeter
1440755 we play hard we should have beaten argentina last weekend in the diamondball tournament not many people expect us to do a lot at the olympics but we think we could cause some upsets wed like to do something special weve never won a medal

1440790 what if a very successful comedian thinks hes dying and then finds out hes not
1440791 this material was never shown to kate gerry jane tanner or anyone else in the group
1440792 seeing it in the files is the first they have known about it again one has to ask what the police were doing by not making this material available at the time
1440793 it is frankly outrageous that information relating to potential suspects was not made available as a matter of extreme urgency once it was clear what had happened
1440794 the early stages of this were crucial and the police of all people should know that seeing these images has come as a shock to everyone concerned
1440795 the investigators are well aware that their work is not exempt from imperfections
1440796 they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results
1440797 this is not unfortunately a police story a crime fit for the investigative mind of a sherlock holmes or a hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice always restore order
1440798 he then realised the man was staring fixedly at the area in question very focused on what he was doing and did not notice flacks presence
1440799 he said he did not remember seeing the man there before or anywhere else in luz since madeleines disappearance
1440800 no element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances of madeleines disappearance
1440801 while it is a fact that madeleine disappeared from the ocean club apartment the circumstances and manner of how this happened is not known

1440814 the fact tiger woods isnt here is a shame for probably the spectators

1440816 the easy way to make a course more difficult is to make it longer the key is to make a course where the guy who has to hit a 6 iron out of a fairway bunker to the green has the same penalty as the guy who hits a 9 iron out of the bunker

1440862 the halacha jewish law holds no all inclusive exemption for pregnant women or those breastfeeding each case must be assessed separately the rabbi explained that the assumption that nowadays women are weaker than they were in the past is not necessary so and the medical logic says that in light of the nutrition and medicine that we live with today the situation is exactly the opposite thus he disputes the lenient halachic position stating that women in these situations must be exempt from fasting in all cases a stance supported in the recent years by popular rabbis of the religious zionist persuasion this is the rule decided upon by the head of the petach tikva hesder yeshiva rabbi yuval sherlow right before tisha bav

1440896 im in the business of taking a young man and building him into a responsible young man and obviously i feel like ive failed in this situation
1440897 sometimes for the better good of the whole some parts have to be sacrificed
1440898 there is basically a little more as i delved into it than i was aware of at the time
1440899 i had hoped this wouldnt be the way that the starting quarterback would be named
1440900 i would have rather have done it on the field and without controversy
1440901 i knew he was going to get in some playing time troubles
1440902 but in the end its all about what you have and how you plan to move on since hes not on our team anymore its tragic and everybody wants him on our team but we cant really dwell on it
1440903 i have no hard feelings and i mean that truly
1440904 i think he still has the ability to help a ballclub
1440905 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1440906 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1440907 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1440908 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1440909 youve got an economic slowdown and markets are slowly coming to terms with it

1440913 i think stephen is a bit disappiointed but from our point of view he will certainly push roy carroll
1440914 stephen has looked very sharp in pre season and i am not disappointed especially with lewis price being injured
1440915 he has spent the past couple of weeks with the physical conditioner to get his fitness up and has now joined in with the squad
1440916 we are going to try to take him on loan until the end of the season and are in the process of doing that deal
1440917 he has gone back to latvia and is due back for training tomorrow andrey can play wide right or left he is a good footballer and impressed me greatly and considering that was his first game for us i thought he equipped himself very well for the money it is costing us it is a gamble that is worth taking
1440918 i sometimes prefer that to see how the player adapts and progresses
1440919 we have got gary and mile but andrey will strengthen the squad
1440920 he is different to gary he has not got garys pace but he is a good passer and he was involved in the two goals against utrecht
1440921 alan gives us that experience quality and leadership and at the back he is a good talker
1440922 he will be skipper but as ive said on numerous occasions just because a player is wearing the armband it doesnt mean he is going to play every game alan is no different to anybody else he has to earn the right to be in the team
1440923 the responsibility at times may be played on savs shoulders a little bit too much some people can take to captaincy some people find it difficult to be perfectly honest i do not see it as a big deal personally maybe it will give sav a bit less responsibility and a bit more freedom to go and express himself
1440924 i speak to a lot of managers and they say their dressing rooms are the same when i was playing there was a lot of talkers and leaders the game is more quiet now whether that is the influence of the foreign players because they are not as vocal as the british players i dont know even the foreign coaches are not as vocal as maybe our coaches are now we have to have music in the dressing room to have noise
1440925 this is great even under these circumstances this is great
1440926 we provide enterprise management for the complete infrastructure whether virtualized or non virtualized
1440927 rather than just using xenserver specific management tools at the hypervisor we manage physical hosts virtual guests and anything else thats hooked up to the environment including mainframes databases clouds and saas software as a service
1440928 are not as friendly for production infrastructures that have a high rate of change which you typically see in infrastructures with virtualization
1440929 as a rule xenserver isnt well managed in the ecosystem yet and hyperics all about managing that environment monitoring performance and resources and adjusting them automatically
1440930 for what they do theyre the first such product for citrix xenserver
1440931 servers have physically been designed to handle one environment and the that goes with it including interfaces to storage and the network they arent optimized to run multiple environments simultaneously so when you run lots of different environments on a single server you have the potential for them to conflict with one another as they try to get to storage and network resources and thats a real bottleneck
1440932 not really efficient enough so you need something like 3leaf
1440933 we drive mainframe class features into x86 class commodity servers
1440934 id think if you have mission critical applications youd want to recover them in a lot quicker than six hours
1440935 microsoft and vmware are battling over milliseconds in terms of virtualization for disaster recovery and business continuity
1440936 its had a bit of a rough time in the states its opening against one of the highest grossing movies batman
1440937 people in the states are so used to lots of cgi action and sex and we dont really offer a lot of that in this film
1440938 you can tell gayle if she calls that im famous now for writing all of these rock and roll songs and even if thats a lie she shouldve given me a try
1440939 to ensure we continue the a1gp tradition of strong racing coupled with lots of overtaking the effort of the design team has been to provide a chassis that has a good level of down force but without the normal penalties this will make for much closer racing particularly in the corners as cars will be able to run together we have spent in excess of 300 hours in the wind tunnel and have tried hundreds of different aerodynamic variations to ensure the close exciting racing the series is famous for not only continues but gets better

1440943 mummy makeovers have a similar safety profile to individually performed procedures while offering distinct advantages versus multiple surgical sessions
1440944 a tummy tuck breast lift and liposuction are all common procedures for mothers looking to recreate their pre baby body for a woman who wants to have plastic surgery after pregnancy combining the procedures certainly makes a lot of sense
1440945 based on our review combining cosmetic procedures in a single surgical session for a mummy makeover does not appear to create any additional risk to the patient versus having procedures performed one at a time

1441131 s fue una jugada que ellos elaboran dentro del rea tiran y hay un desv o y le sale con buena colocaci n desafortunadamente fue el empate y se nos van dos puntos pero creo que salimos tranquilos porque hicimos un gran esfuerzo lo intentamos no pudimos anotar otro gol y bueno as es el futbol no hay que bajar la cara ni dejar de intentar porque eso s puede ser malo
1441132 s es un buen punto seguimos ah en los primeros lugares y eso nos debe de dejar tranquilos obviamente que como se dieron las cosas en el partido pues s te deja un trago amargo porque tuvimos muchas opciones y era un partido ganable pero ya analizando con la cabeza fr a creo que dentro de todo es un punto que nos sirve para estar peleando por el primer puesto
1441133 s as nos acostumbran hay partidos que no se pueden ganar pero tampoco se pueden perder entonces creo que un punto es un punto y hay que tomarlo as con calma ahora esperar una semana y prepararnos para el juego en casa contra cruz azul y sumar de a tres nuevamente

1441136 vamos a esperar la verdad que no podemos adelantar nada en este momento lo que s es que hoy est fuera
1441137 pienso que traer n un cuadro fuerte ya que se est n preparando para una temporada muy importante para ellos as que pienso que ven el duelo en nuestro estadio como una buena prueba para ellos
1441138 vislumbro que ser un juego muy complicado el del s bado porque tendremos un rival de mucha calidad el cual nos exigir desde el inicio y hasta el final del partido
1441139 el resultado me sorprendi porque nunca esperas que milan pierda 5 0 tengo la esperanza de que podremos ensayar el contragolpe que en los partidos de pretemporada es muy dif cil realizar pero este ser un duelo competitivo
1441140 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago

1441142 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1441143 line and listen to this weeks message and leave one for me
1441144 en lo personal tengo ganas de participar ya que no es lo mismo ver el juego de fuera siempre con la intenci n de aportar mi granito de arena si inicio ma ana ser decisi n de benjam n yo me siento en ritmo pero l es el que pone el cuadro yo me siento muy bien
1441145 todos sabemos que estos duelos son importantes y como tal los vamos a jugar
1441146 los hemos analizado bien y para ganar hay que ser pacientes tener valor para atacar y defender cruz azul ha aprovechado los pocos d as para prepararnos y tenemos la mentalidad de tener un buen trabajo vamos a ir a proponer porque la idea es que este nuevo cruz azul sea protagonista sin arriesgar de m s en el marcador
1441147 el funcionamiento del equipo depender mucho de la forma en la que se pare ma ana el rival pero nosotros tenemos que seguir actuando con la determinaci n que hemos venido mostrando y as podemos tener una buena actuaci n en el equipo si logramos igualar lo que hicimos el fin de semana pasado nos ir bien
1441148 tenemos que concentrarnos bien en el aspecto de la pelota parada porque as nos han metido dos goles ya que sabemos que el tener goles en contra implica m s trabajo para conseguir al menos un par de anotaciones de ventaja en cada partido
1441149 los dos duelos servir n para que podamos viajar contentos a espa a ma ana la clave ser salir bien concentrados san luis se nos ha complicado en los ltimos partidos y sigue siendo un equipo muy competente
1441150 sab amos que corr amos un riesgo al iniciar el torneo le present a la directiva lo que tieniamos de bajas para iniciar el torneo cuatro jugadores uno por l nea teniendo que ver a los jugadores que han estado como suplentes y armar un equipo que en el papel yo lo vi competitivo en la pretemporada lo observ bastante bien pero las circunstancias fueron adversas no nos favorecieron y obviamente este arranque no est programado
1441151 pero la verdad lo medimos mal hay que salir fortalecidos lo que no mata fortalece y vamos con esa idea al siguiente encuentro unidos m s integrados y con la firme convicci n de hacer bien las cosas en san luis para sacar un resultado positivo
1441152 ya que no hab a pasado por estas circunstancias cuando pasas algo y lo resuelves de una manera que a lo mejor no es la mejor manera pero si la resuelves bien a una experiencia futura tendr s como afrontarla eso es sacarle provecho a la situaci n y a san luis hay tratar de hacerle da o por que es un equipo complicado que sabe tratar bien la pelota pero sobre todo marca muy bien
1441153 he escuchado a muchos t cnicos decir que tienen listas las maletas la verdad yo no aqu nos vemos la otra semana
1441154 estoy igual que siempre bien no es la primera vez que jugamos juntos
1441155 comentando cosas que me parece ya que tendr an que terminar
1441156 lo que pasa es que ustedes opinan mirando a la cara de los dem s y sacan conclusiones de que uno est feliz o no y uno siempre repite lo mismo uno es feliz jugando al futbol

1441161 siempre tenemos la obligaci n de dar el m ximo de ganar sabemos que tenemos una camiseta muy importante que representamos a nuestro pa s y que intentaremos dar el m ximo por conseguir las medallas de oro
1441162 si ganamos el primer partido vamos a tener gran parte de la clasificaci n
1441163 brasil tambi n tiene grandes jugadores tiene a ronaldinho que se le ve con muchas ganas y que seguramente le va a sacar ventaja
1441164 nosotros sabemos que tenemos un buen equipo y que tendremos que estar muy concentrados sabiendo que contra nosotros siempre el contrario le da un poquito m s y que seguramente va a ser todo muy dif cil

1441166 gastric bypass patients work very hard to manage their weight and adjust their lifestyle after surgery
1441167 sometimes through no fault of their own or their surgeon the benefits of the bypass procedure are not permanent
1441168 to date revision options have been expensive difficult to perform and risky for the patient effectively leaving them without any treatment options now with this new incisionless procedure being offered at bluegrass bariatric we have a new and dramatically less invasive way to correct a key cause of weight regain
1441169 by eliminating skin incisions this new procedure may provide important advantages to patients including reduced risk of infection and associated complications less post operative pain faster recovery time and no abdominal scars
1441170 my original gastric bypass procedure was the best thing id ever done for myself i lost 99 pounds and really felt great but then the weight gradually started coming back

1441210 stiamo lavorando faremo un altro miracolo e regaleremo allitalia una sua profittevole compagnia di bandiera
1441211 al punto in cui siamo giunti la questione alitalia richiede uno sforzo congiunto di tutte le energie del paese le forze politiche le istituzioni nazionali e locali le organizzazioni dei lavoratori le imprese per raggiungere un obiettivo che diventa ogni giorno pi difficile
1441212 in questa prospettiva credo che pur nel normale svolgersi della dialettica politica e parlamentare debba prevalere ha sottolineato vito la consapevolezza che il recupero di efficienze e di competitivit dellazienda rappresenta un interesse nazionale di rilevanza strategica rispetto al quale sarebbe irresponsabile ridurre il confronto ad una sterile contrapposizione tra maggioranza ed opposizione
1441213 the asian market is one of the most important automotive markets in the world and we are very pleased to extend our presence there especially with a prominent market leader such as nissan

1441215 the mitsubishi forklift trucks product line is known for providing reliable equipment that will keep our customers operations moving

1441217 le semplificazioni in materia di lavoro ha detto sacconi comporteranno un risparmio annuo di circa 4 miliardi di euro questo solo linizio di un percorso
1441218 questo equivale a una riduzione fiscale per le imprese questa operazione fa male alla cattiva burocrazia e di questo non ce ne importa niente fa invece bene alla competitivit nel 2012 mi piacerebbe arrivare a un taglio dai 17 ai 25 miliardi di euro lequivalente di una manovra finanziaria

1441224 as we previously announced our second quarter results were below our expectations due to challenges primarily in the areas of revenue per day and vehicle depreciation costs
1441225 in this tough economic environment we continue to concentrate on the items in our business that we control such as maximizing revenue per day vehicle utilization cost reduction and service delivery
1441226 our focus in todays environment is on executing every day in every market with every customer
1441227 e necessario rispettare lo sport ha detto il titolare della farnesina e non politicizzare i giochi
1441228 sia da stimolo per tutti gli atleti compresi quelli italiani
1441229 a fare un qualunque gesto che non solo il boicottaggio o non sfilare alla cerimonia inaugurale ma anche indossare qualcosa di simbolico o parlare dei valori quando si intervistati
1441230 gli atleti italiani non hanno bisogno di inviti perch sanno perfettamente qual il dovere morale cui adempiono nel momento in cui gareggiano
1441231 non mancher loro la possibilit nelle modalit che riterranno pi opportune per esprimere piena adesione alla necessit di un rispetto autentico dei diritti delle persone
1441232 nessuno vuole dimenticare la questione dei diritti umani in cina tuttavia nellimminenza dellapertura delle olimpiadi opportuno tenere separata la politica dallo sport
1441233 la via spiega il leader del pd walter veltroni non disertare la cerimonia di apertura che da sempre la festa di paesi di culture diverse ma sarebbe molto positivo se nel corso delle olimpiadi fosse visibile limpegno civile di molti atleti a favore del tibet
1441234 chiedere agli atleti di disertare la cerimonia inaugurale una ipocrisia ma anche un ribaltamento delle proprie responsabilit

1441237 the success of this years motor show can be attributed not only to the quality of the global debuts and the support of such a fantastic collection of motor manufacturers but also to the wide range of interactive attractions and family friendly features
1441238 following our decision to hold the vauxhall insignia world debut in london gms motor show experience was excellent from beginning to end
1441239 the number of people showing interest in all of the gm brands exceeded our expectations from families and business car drivers drawn to the all new insignia to supercar fans drooling over the new corvette zr1 and chevy camaro
1441240 no sooner has this show closed than we start planning the next one
1441241 we have had a terrific range of events and exhibitors this year and we will have to work very hard to raise the stakes again in 2010 but we are ready for the challenge the feedback we have had from exhibitors has been immensely positive so we are confident that the show will be even bigger and even better in two years time

1441262 if there s one sector that stands to benefit handsomely from a further slide in oil or at least a moderation in crude s rally the airlines
1441263 some investors will rightfully cringe from any mention of this sector after all the airlines have consistently lost money throughout their post deregulation history
1441264 most of the majors have declared bankruptcy on multiple occasions since that time however we ve traded the airlines on a few occasions we took some triple digit percentage gains in the airlines back in 2005
1441265 the airlines leverage to oil prices is well known expectations are so low in fact that several major air carriers actually managed to beat consensus expectations in the second quarter
1441266 and although sentiment is already at rock bottom there s a real basis for cautious optimism first if i m right about oil fuel costs won t rise appreciably in the third quarter this huge headwind is dissipating
1441267 my two favorite airlines for a trade are us airways and delta air lines delta reported a 1 billion loss in the second quarter but that includes a 1 1 billion noncash accounting charge known as goodwill impairment
1441268 if we net that out delta actually posted a small profit quite frankly that s amazing given the more than 100 jump in fuel costs the carrier has experienced over the past year
1441269 delta is aggressively cutting costs and reducing capacity delta has 1 billion in undrawn capacity on its credit lines and 3 3 billion in unrestricted cash the company isn t going bankrupt any time soon
1441270 delta is also in the process of merging with northwest airlines in the company s most recent conference call delta raised its projected savings resulting from this merger buy below 8 i see the potential to reach the mid teens
1441271 buying airlines is extremely risky you should only take this trade if you re willing to assume a far higher than average risk and are ready to treat it as a trade not an investment
1441272 for the even more adventurous there s us airways like delta you could argue that us airways was actually profitable or close to it in the second quarter if we exclude noncash charges us airways will also benefit from lower fuel costs and sharply falling capacity
1441273 i think now is a particularly opportune time to buy the world s largest fast food company
1441274 yum brands operates 35 000 restaurants under the kfc taco bell and pizza hut brands
1441275 for starters yum keeps extending its streak of impressive results for the seventh quarter in a row it beat expectations
1441276 earnings per share increased 16 for the quarter and 28 year to date not to be overlooked either is the fact yum raised guidance again
1441277 this quarter fewer than 5 of companies in the s amp p 500 can boast this triple whammy beating earnings and revenue estimates and raising guidance
1441278 ironically while most of the other triple whammy stocks enjoyed hefty single and double digit run ups on the announcements yum sold off
1441279 and here s where i think most investors are missing the boat and once again focusing too heavily on the short term yes yum s in a pinch food costs are rising and consumers are spending less
1441280 in other words margins are getting squeezed and the company like most others isn t about to raise prices for fear of destroying more demand but margins are only off about 1 across all divisions hardly an amount to panic about
1441281 moreover sales are still increasing at double digit rates so even if yum s making a little less on each one pound burrito at taco bell or variety bucket at kfc net profits are still increasing
1441282 not to mention this margin contraction is a short term phenomenon
1441283 even if the margin pressure persists a little longer than we expect it will do little to undermine the long term fundamentals working in the company s favor namely international expansion for six years running yum s added at least a thousand new international locations
1441284 ceo david novak expects 2008 to be no different in fact worldwide he expects the company to open 1 600 new units that s 4 4 per day making yum the fastest growing retailer in the world
1441285 of course growth in china is propelling this massive expansion operating profits for yum s china division alone jumped 38 in the most recent quarter and it will continue to do so into the foreseeable future
1441286 with only 2 726 china locations yum s still in the first inning with the bases loaded and no outs of a tremendous growth story management estimates that china can conservatively support 20 000 locations that s the equivalent of 36 more years of growth at current rates
1441287 and when you tack on a massive 4 billion stock repurchase program a five year average return on equity of 60 a dividend that s quadrupled in four years a non cyclical industry world class leadership and new efforts to reignite same store sales in the united states i have little reservations recommending this stock
1441288 rebates to individuals are expected to total 106 7 billion for 2008 the majority of rebates were sent during the initial round of payments which began april 28 2008 and will continue on a weekly basis through mid july 2008
1441289 expecting strong growth in the second half of the year

1441345 ayah saya melihat sebelas bintang dan matahari dan bulan saya melihat mereka sujud kepada saya
1441346 seorang daripada mereka berkata tidak janganlah membunuh yusuf tetapi lemparlah dia ke dasar sumur dan supaya dipungut oleh sebagian orang orang yang lalu pengembara jika kamu mau melakukan
1441347 sesunggungnya kepergian kamu bersama yusuf amat menyedihkanku dan aku khawatir kalau kalau ia dimakan serigala sedang kamu lalai daripadanya
1441348 sesungguhnya kamu akan menceritakan kepada mereka perbuatan mereka ini sedang mereka tiada ingat lagi
1441349 ayah kami pergi berlomba lari dan kami meninggalkan yusuf dengan barang barang kami lalu dia dimakan serigala tetapi ayah tentu tidak akan mempercayai kami sekalipun kami berkata benar
1441350 bahkan sebenarnya dirimu sendirilah yang memandang baik perbuatan yang buruk ini maka kesabaran itulah yang baik dan allah jualah yang dimohon pertolongan nya terhadap apa yang kamu ceritakan
1441351 hormatilah kedudukannya boleh jadi dia akan bermanfaat kepada kita atau kita pungut dia sebagai anak sendiri
1441352 aku berlindung pada allah sesungguhnya tuanku telah memperlakukan aku dengan baik
1441353 apakah balasan bagi orang yang menghendaki berbuat serong dengan istrimu selain dipejarakan atau dihukum dengan sisaan yang pedih
1441354 jika bajunya koyak di bagian depan maka perempuan itu telah berkata benar dan yusuf berdusta termasuk orang yang berdusta tetapi jika bajunya koyak di bagian belakang maka perempuan itulah yang berdusta dan yusuf orang yang benar
1441355 sesungguhnya perbuatan ini adalah sebagian dari tipu daya kamu yusuf berpalinglah dari hal ini dan engkau hai istriku mohon ampunlah atas dosamu itu karena sesungguhnya engkau termasuk orang orang yang bersalah
1441356 istri pembesar itu menggoda hambanya yang menundukkan hatinya dengan cinta
1441357 maha sempurna allah ini bukan manusia ini tidak lain hanya malaikat yang mulia
1441358 inilah dia orang yang kamu cela aku karenanya benar aku telah menggoda dia tetapi dia menolak dan jika dia tidak mematuhi apa yang aku perintahkan niscaya dia akan dipenjarakan
1441359 wahai tuhanku penjara lebih aku sukai daripada apa yang mereka serukan padaku
1441360 aku bermimpi bahwa aku membawa roti di atas kepalaku dan sebagian diantaranya dimakan burung terangkan pada kami artinya sesungguhnya kami memandangmu sebagai orang yang berbuat kebajikan
1441361 wahai kedua temanku dalam penjara salah seorang dari kamu akan memberi minuman arak untuk tuannya dia akan kembali ke pekerjaannya semula sebagai pelayan sekeluarnya dari penjara dan yang satu lagi dia akan disalib lalu burung memakan sebagian kepalanya
1441362 aku bermimpi tujuh ekor sapi betina yang gemuk dimakan oleh tujuh ekor sapi betina yang kurus dan tujuh tangkai yang hijau dan tujuh tangkai lain yang kering wahai para pembesar terangkanlah padaku tentang arti mimpiku
1441363 aku sendiri akan memberitahu padamu artinya maka utuslah aku pada yusuf
1441364 kamu bercocok tanam tujuh tahun sebagaimana biasa maka apa yang kamu tuai hendaklah kamu biarkan pada tangkainya kecuali sedikit daripadanya untuk kamu makan kemudian setelah itu akan datang tujuh tahun yang amat sulit menghabiskan apa yang kamu sediakan itu kecuali sedikit yang kamu simpan kemudian sesudah itu akan datang tahun yang padanya manusia diberi hujan dan dimasa itu mereka memeras buah buahan
1441365 kembalilah kepada tuanmu dan tanyakanlah kepadanya bagaimana halnya perempuan perempuan yang telah melukai tangannya yusuf sesungguhnya tuhanku maha mengetahui tipu daya mereka
1441366 pada hari ini engkau di sisi kami mempunyai kedudukan lagi dipercaya
1441367 jadikanlah aku bendahara negeri ini mesir sesungguhnya aku sanggup memelihara lagi cukup mengetahui
1441368 bawalah kepadaku saudaramu yang sebapak yaitu bunyamin tidakkah kamu melihat aku menepati sukatan timbangan ukuran sedang aku sebaik baik penerima tamu tetapi jika kamu tidak membawanya kepadaku maka kamu tidak akan mendapatkan sukatan lagi dari padaku dan jangan kamu mendekatiku
1441369 kami akan membujuk ayah kami dan sungguh kami akan melakukannya
1441370 ayah sukatan itu dilarang bagi kami sebab itu kirimlah saudara kami bunyamin bersama kami supaya kami mendapat sukatan itu sesungguhnya kami akan menjaganya
1441371 adakah aku akan mempercayai kamu kepadanya seperti aku mempercayai kamu kepada saudaranya dahulu
1441372 ayah apakah yang kita inginkan lagi uang kita sudah dikembalikan kepada kita dan kami mendapat bekalan makanan untuk keluarga kami dan kami akan menjaga saudara kita kami akan mendapat tambahan beban seekor unta itulah sukatan perhitungan yang mudah
1441373 aku tidak akan mengutusnya bersama kamu sehingga kamu memberi aku satu janji yang teguh dengan allah bahwa kamu pasti akan mendatangkannya kembali kepadaku kecuali kamu dikepung
1441374 sesungguhnya aku adalah saudaramu maka janganlah engkau bersedih terhadap apa yang telah mereka perbuat
1441375 kami kehilangan gelas berkaki kepunyaan raja dan barang siapa dapat mendatangkannya akan memperoleh bahan makanan seberat beban seekor unta itu aku jamin
1441376 demi allah kamu mengetahui bahwa kami tidak datang untuk membuat kerusakan di muka bumi mesir ini kami bukanlah pencuri
1441377 balasannya adalah bahwa barangsiapa didapati barang yang hilang dalam karungnya maka dia sendirilah balasannya begitulah kami memberi hukuman terhadap orang orang yang zalim
1441378 jika dia seorang pencuri seorang saudaranya yaitu yusuf adalah seorang pencuri juga
1441379 kamulah yang lebih buruk kedudukannya allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu terangkan itu
1441380 wahai al aziz yang perkasa sesungguhnya dia mempunyai ayah yang sangat tua maka ambillah salah seorang antara kami untuk mengganti tempatnya kami melihat bahwa engkau adalah termasuk orang orang yang berbuat baik
1441381 kami berlindung kepada allah daripada menahan seseorang kecuali orang yang kami temukan harta benda kami padanya sesungguhnya jika kami berbuat demikian maka kami termasuk orang orang yang zalim 12 79
1441382 wahai anak anakku pergilah dan carilah berita mengenai yusuf dan saudaranya janganlah berputus asa dari kesenangan allah sesungguhnya tiada yang berputus asa melainkan kaum yang tidak percaya kafir
1441383 wahai al aziz penderitaan telah menyentuh kami dan keluarga kami kami datang dengan membawa barang barang yang tidak berharga tepatilah kepada kami sukatan untuk kami dan bersedekahlah kepada kami sesungguhnya allah membalas orang orang yang bersedekah
1441384 apakah kamu mengetahui apa yang kamu lakukan terhadap yusuf dan saudaranya yang ketika itu kamu belum mengetahuinya
1441385 aku yusuf ini saudaraku sungguh allah telah berbudi baik kepada kami sesiapa bertakwa dan bersabar maka sesungguhnya allah tidak menyia nyiakan pahala bagi orang orang yang berbuat baik
1441386 demi allah sesungguhnya allah lebih menyukai kamu daripada kami dan sesungguhnya kami bersalah
1441387 tidak ada cercaan pada hari ini kepada kamu allah mengampuni kamu dia adalah yang maha penyayang diantara yang paling para penyayang pergilah ambil baju ini dan kamu letakkanlah ke wajah ayahku dan dia akan memperoleh kembali penglihatannya kemudian bawalah kepadaku keluarga kamu semuanya
1441388 sesungguhnya aku mendapati bau yusuf sekiranya kamu tidak menuduh aku lemah akal
1441389 demi allah sungguh engkau adalah dalam kekeliruan engkau yang dahulu
1441390 tidakkah aku mengatakan kepada kamu bahwa aku mengetahui dari allah apa yang kamu tidak tahu
1441391 ayah kami mohonkanlah ampun untuk kami atas kesalahan kesalahan kami sesungguhnya kami bersalah
1441392 sungguh aku akan meminta memohonkan ampun bagi kamu kepada tuhanku sesungguhnya dialah yang maha pengampun lagu maha penyayang

1441448 it was probably somebodys job because everybody has to be employed
1441449 so there was no need for volunteers to do it
1441450 typically there are not a lot of adults available to teens in the czech republic
1441451 theyre busy or working youths need people who are older than them who care about them spend time with them and are there unconditionally for them
1441452 kids have opportunities today their parents never would have dreamed of
1441453 theyre the first generation thats grown up with freedom so theyre figuring it out on their own because their parents grew up differently
1441454 the rules are difficult to explain to kids without a baseball background
1441455 you have to rely on other people a lot so you feel like youve lost your sense of independence
1441456 i think especially under communism you were very close with your immediate family and you could trust those people but you really just didnt know who else you could trust
1441457 so people are very careful about what they say and how they welcome new people and strangers

1441479 we didnt have enough stamina to finish we have to be able to finish in this league the teams that can finish they win
1441480 i want to keep creating this type of environment out here where they have to compete each and every day
1441481 these things are really what well really be judged on later on whether we win or lose those kind of situations the quarterbacks need more at bats in those situations as opposed to looking at a card and getting ready for something that may or may not happen when we get to a game

1441484 theyll present all the facts and the grand jury will decide if any charges are appropriate
1441485 the majority of our investigation focused on the accident investigation and basically how the whole thing transpired in terms of the accident the post accident investigation everything
1441486 thats certainly one of the things that probably will be considered by the grand jury his actions following the accident itself
1441487 he is represented by an attorney so therefore were not interviewing him at this point in time
1441488 the baby has gained a small amount of weight but is still battling for her life
1441489 all alexis recalls is her car stalling out and steering over to the left shoulder of the road
1441490 she put her flashers on and some other vehicles were able to pass by but nicholas joseph was not able to do that for some reason and rear ended her car
1441491 were very interested in where he was coming from and what he had been doing and whether he was under the influence of anything
1441492 and that would obviously have affected his reaction time and whether he could have avoided striking alexis vehicle in the first place

1441542 requisitos y condiciones para la inclusi n y exclusi n del nombre de una persona en el sistema de referencias bancarias
1441543 es de nuestro conocimiento que la sudeban ha venido realizando un proyecto de resoluci n para el uso de sicri y que por intermedio de la pagina web la instituci n ha mantenido una consulta p blica a los fines de dar a conocer el proyecto de resoluci n y recibir sugerencias al respecto y nos solicit a los consumidores y usuarios a trav s de asuserbanc nuestra opini n la cual le hicimos llegar en su oportunidad

1441545 maar mijn respect gaat uit naar de gentleman roger vanden stock die zo chic was mij niet aan te vallen en zelfs te steunen hij weet ook dat ik eerst anderen heb aangezocht om dit te doen
1441546 het profvoetbal in belgi hervormen in de eerste plaats zorgen voor een gezonde economische basis een beter zicht op de geldstromen een andere verhouding tussen profliga en de voetbalbond de kbvb twee jaar geef ik mijzelf en als er niks beweegt dan stap ik meteen op
1441547 de juiste combinatie was ervaring vanuit het bedrijfsleven in combinatie met politieke competenties de doelstellingen zijn gelijk maar de weg daar naar toe vereist diplomatie en onderhandelingstactieken om de geesten te laten rijpen ik had luc vanden bossche wel een geschikte kandidaat gevonden maar de profliga vond dat ik moest verder doen
1441548 de profliga en de voetbalbond zijn verzand in het niet beslissen 80 procent van onze energie gaat op aan interne twisten de rest aan het beheer en aan de voetbalzijde moet de kwaliteit van het product beter
1441549 het licentiesysteem zou beter moeten functioneren er is te veel tolerantie voor clubs die steeds dezelfde zwakheden vertonen bijvoorbeeld op vlak van financieel beleid en infrastructuur zeker in beroep worden tekorten met de mantel der liefde bedekt
1441550 nog iets weet u dat de stijgers hun licentie voor eerste klasse krijgen van de licentiecommissie voor tweede klasse dat gaat nu veranderen als de licentiecommissie de criteria toepast zonder tolerantie dan ziet de eerste klasse er vandaag heel anders uit
1441551 weet u hoeveel aanbevelingen we toen hebben gedaan zeventien weet u hoeveel er daarvan zijn gerealiseerd nul transfergelden zouden zoals in engeland worden gestort aan de bond en dan pas aan de club speciaal om de schulden eerst aan te zuiveren jos vaessen heeft dat voorgesteld en dat is allemaal unaniem goedgekeurd bondsvoorzitter jan peeters heeft dat achteraf op de persconferentie helemaal uitgelegd uw collega rudy nuyens van het laatste nieuws vroeg toen nog binnen welke termijn die aanbevelingen gerealiseerd zouden zijn peeters werd kwaad hoe durfde hij zon vraag stellen het zou onmiddellijk worden ingevoerd dat was 20 maart 2006 anderhalf jaar later is alles nog hetzelfde
1441552 ik begrijp deloitte ons voetbalbeheer is niet transparant genoeg dus begrijp ik ook de overheid die vinden voetbal boeiend maar door de ondoorzichtige geldstromen willen ze niet participeren niks garandeert mij dat er vandaag niet weer een soort ye aan het werk is die onze wedstrijden vervalst we zijn het aan onszelf verplicht om dat zeventienpuntenplan uit te voeren
1441553 plus nog eens vier ploegen die je tolereert om met veertien te zijn dat was n visie er was ook het eerste plan wijnants met twee keer twaalf ploegen daarna kregen we een verbeterde versie met twee keer tien er zouden twee ronden worden gespeeld een eerste waarbij de laatste vijf een tweede ronde in groep b spelen en de eerste vijf van elke poule in een groep a om de titel spelen de zwakheid is dat die groep b een veredelde tweede klasse is
1441554 maar het plan heeft wel de verdienste dat het de spanning verhoogt we spreken er vandaag over met de voorzitters van de eerste klasse dat is geen vrijblijvende vergadering integendeel wel zal ik van elke maatregel voor onze competitie eerst het effect laten bestuderen voor we beslissen
1441555 het puur schrappen van de sportieve dimensie lijkt mij wat drastisch misschien moet er een eindronde komen tussen eerste en tweede klasse om te dalen en te stijgen het gaat inderdaad om kmos en anderlecht behoort tot 500 grootste bedrijven in belgi een goede spreiding van die bedrijven lijkt mij logisch de amateuristisch recreatieve visie op voetbal is voorbij ik heb niks tegen dender integendeel maar als daar volgend jaar hamme bij komt en elk jaar opnieuw zon sympathiek fenomeen dan zitten we niet op het juiste spoor ik wil niet in de situatie komen dat ik de man ben die de teams uit eerste klasse weer dat is de taak van de licentiecommissie en die moet vooral extern worden bemand
1441556 de clubs die het vandaag sportief en economisch waard zijn om in eerste klasse te spelen zouden kansen moeten krijgen om in eerste te blijven met een ondersteunend systeem vanuit de competitie om uiteindelijk een vorm van competitief evenwicht te vinden
1441557 clubs die hebben bewezen dat ze genoeg fans naar het stadion krijgen geef je zo de tijd te groeien beter nog je belet hiermee dat ze in de tweede kolom ineens exotische pistes gaan wandelen ik hoor nu weer van een egyptenaar wat hebben we al allemaal niet gehad waarom zijn al onze redders exoten dat zijn geen goeie signalen
1441558 oezbeken chinezen russen egyptenaren waarom doen die mannen dat mensenhandel witwassen of om de competitie te be nvloeden en dan via het gokken winst te maken het is mij niet duidelijk maar geen enkele exotische piste heeft onze clubs ook maar al iets opgeleverd
1441559 geen kat wat het verschil is tussen de profliga en de bond
1441560 maar ook de missie van de bond ken ik niet zij doen een aantal dingen voor ons en als ze dat nog willen blijven doen zal het van een onberispelijk professioneel niveau moeten zijn niet zoals nu de teneur in de meeste landen is een verzelfstandiging van de liga de bond lacht met de liga omdat we altijd ruzie maken wat in het verleden ook wel klopte en omgekeerd vinden ze in de profliga dat in de bond geknoeid wordt
1441561 onwaarschijnlijk zwaar de voetbalbond heeft jaren niet gefunctioneerd en zich zeker niet aangepast ik heb de indruk dat de keersmaecker de goeie dingen wil hij ziet het juist en heeft een goed denkpatroon of hij structureel organisatorisch iets zal kunnen veranderen dat weet ik niet
1441562 neen maar dat moet groeien de blokken van de vijf grote clubs tegen de dertien andere clubs dat is niet meer zo uitgesproken we hebben voor elke verandering een tweederdemeerderheid nodig ik zal dus mijn mening over het competitiebestel verdedigen maar ik ben er vooral op uit als voorzitter om een kwalitatieve consensus te bereiken
1441563 de tv rechten zijn onderworpen aan europese regels van mededinging en die stipuleren onder meer dat de rechten in loten op de markt komen net als vorige keer gaan we meer krijgen dan 36 miljoen euro ik reken op meer ik denk dat onze rechten in vergelijking met het buitenland nu te laag geprijsd zijn
1441564 ik denk dat anderlecht hoopt dat ze op een dag weer volwaardig bij europa zullen horen zoals roeselare ook droomt dat het misschien zo sterk als club kan worden ik hoor dat de grote clubs meer geld van de tv willen maar anderzijds heb je clubs die een herverdeling willen organiseren omwille van het competitief evenwicht
1441565 ik wil in elk geval een duidelijk signaal de krachtsverhoudingen moeten anders

1441575 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1441576 the primary concern with our current very active seasonal forecast numbers is the continued ocean surface warming in the eastern and central tropical pacific although it seems unlikely at this point there is a possibility that a weak el nino could develop by the latter part of the hurricane season if this happened it would likely reduce the number of late season tropical cyclones
1441577 we expect the atlantic basin tropical cyclone season will be very active with activity that is about 190 percent of the long term average
1441578 we base our predictions on long period statistical models constructed on the past 60 years of historical data residents should take these forecasts as an indication of what this years hurricane activity is likely to be if the global atmosphere and ocean behave in the next few months as they have over the last 60 years no seasonal forecasts can determine when or where storms are going to strike so coastal residents should take precautions during hurricane season and be prepared
1441579 the same factors that make individual months active or inactive are often not the same factors that make the entire season active or inactive
1441580 we are continually improving our forecasts to provide people with specific monthly hurricane forecasts along with landfall probability forecasts
1441581 we are in an active cycle in the atlantic basin that is expected to last another 15 to 20 years we believe this is part of a natural ocean cycle and is not the result of human induced increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide

1441607 the reason the whole sienna fling happened was because he fell off the wagon he stopped ringing his counselor and stopped going to meetings him not being sober is the key to the whole mess as soon as balthy arrived back in la he started pleading with his wife to take him back he told me hed gone to their house and stood outside crying he was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna

1441619 gm says chevy volt battery will have a 10 year 150 000 mile warranty
1441620 confirmed the capability of our selected cell chemistry in terms of safety range recharge time power density and energy density
1441621 but one of the important challenges remaining is proving ten year 150 000 mile life when were developing the battery over a three year timeframe obviously well protect the customer in this regard with our warranty
1441622 that kind of warranty is excellent now how about the rest of the car i would think the electric motor would be a no brainer since i understand they dont break
1441623 but one of the important challenges remaining is proving ten year 150 000 mile life when were developing the battery over a three year timeframe obviously well protect the customer in this regard with our warranty but we still need to prove out the required durability
1441624 every cloud with a silver lining is really dark in the middle
1441625 i read an article in an auto magazine where evs will have 1 10th the moving parts of an ice power vehicle
1441626 to me the volt represents independance and i demand that choice
1441627 even with this mornings err ill still be reading your posts and waiting for you to say
1441628 a nimh battery can have two to three times the capacity of an equivalent size nicd however compared to the lithium ion battery the volumetric energy density is lower and self discharge is higher
1441629 overall the battery development is on track but one of the important challenges remaining is proving ten year 150 000 mile life when were developing the battery over a three year timeframe obviously well protect the customer in this regard with our warranty but we still need to prove out the required durability
1441630 how can i get one of those new improved energy density batteries and a firmware chip for 60 aer
1441631 to me the volt represents independance and i demand that choice
1441632 he says that battery energy density will have to improve though before e flex cars larger than the volt could emerge
1441633 a startup reports progress on a battery that stores more energy than lithium ion ones
1441634 these advancements provide the pathway to meeting our present requirements
1441635 ps statik you really are the attention seaker you should post more often in the forums but again less people would read you at least on the last few posts you didnt hack the main subject
1441636 even with this mornings err ill still be reading your posts and waiting for you to say
1441637 how many pairs of shoes does your wife have anyway
1441638 10 years on the battery is a good warranty but why 150 000 miles if you drive 40 miles every day for 10 years it comes to about 146 000 miles if you use the range extender to drive another 40 per day you will reach the mileage limit in about 5 years the mileage warranty on the battery should be for electric driving only
1441639 id love if eestor works out but im a doubting thomas i will believe it when i see it
1441640 challenges remain in proving the batteries will last 10 years and 150 000 miles indicating for the first time publicly that gm plans to warranty that benchmark

1441649 the controls that were developing do a few things theyre primary function is all the hardware and software that monitors and controls the state of the battery so it controls the state of charge and the state of health of the battery and it will also help with the cell balance so it will look at all the different cells it takes very precise measurements on every single cell and then there are a series of calculations and then based on that it will do adjustments to make sure that all of the cells are balanced properly
1441650 battery energy density will have to improve though before e flex cars larger than the volt could emerge

1441706 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1441707 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1441708 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1441709 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1441710 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1441718 to advance the competitive use of steel through a market driven strategy that promotes cost effective steel based solutions
1441719 a strong demand for steel in the marketplace is essential to ensuring our industrys overall competitiveness aisis market development programs have allowed us to develop a unified approach enabling the steel industry to keep pace in the global economy
1441720 the north american steel industry is widely recognized as having a dynamic and innovative model for making steel the material of choice through market development
1441721 our aggressive approach to pro competitive collaboration between steel producers and customers is providing value to our members in the form of steel solutions in the marketplace it also reflects strategic direction resulting from the aisi visioning project which led to the institutes heightened focus on a robust policy agenda while also recognizing the importance of advancing steel as the material of choice
1441722 dave helped build the market development program into a category leader over the past 20 years and is well qualified to lead the implementation of this new business unit

1441728 our new years resolution was to acquire two new properties before the end of 2008 one giving us oil and gas production income and one giving us a high potential exploration property the tungkal acquisition gives us the realization of the first half of that goal and we have negotiations in the works that should realize the second half on schedule

1441852 este vorba despre legea mozaica in care preotimea aaronica impreuna cu semintia lui levi alcatuiau clasa de preoti care slujeau in templul domnului totodata legea mozaica era bazata pe o sumedenie de jertfe pentru pacate ispasire si altele care toate laolalta erau o umbra a viitoarei si supremei jertfe si anume a jertfei lui isus isus a desfintat legea mozaica fiindca acum el adevarata jertfa sa prezentat pentru scopul lui dumnezeu iar legea de dinante de el nu mai era valabila fiindca fusese implinita asteptarile israelitilor au luat sfarsit caci a sosit mantuitorul sau o desfinteaza si o data cu ea si ziua de sabat sau de odihna care dupa calendarul de atunci pica sambata in cadrul calendarului nostru

1441854 totodata legea aaronica tinuta pana la venirea lui mesia nu ii ierta pe evrei de pacate ci doar le amintea de ele pentru a nu le mai face si pentru a respecta legea lui dumnezeu ea nu promitea viata vesnica

1441873 im not a crusader for hip hop or for language even though i deal with words i deal with words to point at the spirit you know what im saying im more concerned about the evolution of humanity and the music that i make be it hip hop or rock and the language that i use be it spoken or written is aimed at invisible things that one can only connect to through prayer and meditation and my concern is seeing that meditative state becoming reality in all of our lives so that we can live peacefully not just with each other and not just in some government standardized version of the martin luther king dream way but in a way that is harmonious with the universe and that is beyond militarism
1441874 hip hop is a rhythmical musical derivative of poetry like the child of the traditional sense of poetry poetry being the mother i grew up with the child and after a while i was like wow youre really cool id like to meet your parents
1441875 with poetry saul felt he could focus more in introspection philosophy and metaphysics topics that were sadly being phased out of the ever more image conscious braggadocio style that was overtaking hip hop
1441876 were always saying word up and word is bond gang starrs first fucking hit was these are the words that i manifest hip hop is about the power of word and when emcees forget that they forget themselves and they become fucking caricatures of themselves living out some dream that is not theirs its just buying into the american dream

1441943 im going to answer that the best i can your phone was breaking up we had a bad connection there were working with goodyear as far as evaluating a wider tire a tire that is a larger circumference that allows it to have a larger volume of air in there and helps its durability i think part of your question was about the tire width and size versus the body i think i got that out of it if we come to a place that goodyear needs to be to help the performance help the tires and help the feel as far as the body goes and the sheet metal those type of things can be changed in a matter of days or weeks or months with proper planning were looking at some different things with goodyear you know well follow their lead on what they need to help the performance and durability of the tires
1441944 the problem is solely theirs and by that i mean its theirs to figure out its not going to come with anything we do to the track figuring it out will only come with getting the car and tire combination right and that requires actually spending the time and effort to do something about it the track wont change next year so if they want to come back they better figure it out because i dont think the fans want to come back and see that
1441945 indianapolis motor speedway diamond cut the racetrack causing the tires not only to wear quickly but turn to a powder diamond cutting didnt work at charlotte and it really didnt work at indy i blame the officials at indy for making this race so bad turning 400 miles into 10 lap heat races ill go to the local short tracks for heat races not indy re do the track surface making it smooth and raceable also put a companion race like arca or indy lights at the speedway on saturday

1441947 what a difference in the racing between the brickyard 400 and the pocono 500 using the same goodyear tires
1441948 because of olympics certain types of abuses are increasing in china
1441949 these abuses are directly connected to the organization of olympics to have smooth olympics theyre basically abusing the rights of their own citizens at this moment
1441950 theyre satisfied with their country and 82 percent say their economy is good whats extraordinary about it is that it is almost a universal opinion its shared by just about everyone we polled
1441951 china is a freer better richer place then it was when it was awarded the games
1441952 but actually at closer examination what seemed to come through was firstly its more to do with things like opening up the economy as a whole and to do with odd things like the spread of mobile telephony the impact of that type of freedom by contrast most of the actual impact of the games themselves have tended to be in the opposite direction
1441953 organizers of the olympic games have been providing sufficient and convenient internet access
1441954 so they have a duty and responsibility they are not doing it for whatever reason
1441955 it has to be remembered that the ioc is a sports organization and electing beijing as the host city some seven years ago was really with a vision to see how sport and the coming together of the world could have a positive impact
1441956 but its not for us to make direct statements on the matter of human rights its really a discussion between governments and the relevant organizations who are the experts in this field
1441957 youll represent americas love for freedom and our regard for human rights and human dignity
1441958 youll represent that to other athletes and to the people of china
1441959 i would say that im sure that come the ninth of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over

1441962 respeto las decisiones del presidente y del vicepresidente yo voy a platicar con ellos m s tarde
1441963 no para nada lo nico que me pone nervioso es no tener a mis jugadores los que est n en la selecci n pero como siempre dijimos vamos a apoyarla y la estamos apoyando a mi lo que me corresponde es tratar de trabajar m s todav a para que contra monterrey el s bado estemos al cien
1441964 se me hace inc modo que contra cruz azul ramos un gran equipo que iba a dar mucha pelea y un partido despu s contra tecos porque contra barcelona no lo tomo mucho en cuenta las cosas cambian much simo pero yo tengo toda la tranquilidad no estoy para nada intranquilo
1441965 yo a jorge lo conozco desde hace cuatro a os y s c mo piensa s lo que le gusta y siempre m s o menos hemos concordado en lo mismo yo creo que por eso me trajeron para tratar de crear un tipo de perfil de jugador de acuerdo a la filosof a de esta instituci n y comparto lo que dicen jorge y n stor claro con las circunstancias debidas
1441966 en chivas estamos acostumbrados a trabajar bajo esta presi n yo como encargado del equipo debo tener m s calma y estoy preparado normalmente chivas no pierde dos partidos seguidos parece que perder un amistoso repercuti m s de lo que yo esperaba perdi mil n 5 0 contra chelsea y no se hizo un drama y ac el campe n del f tbol mexicano tambi n lleva un punto igual que nosotros y no creo que haya tantos focos rojos como dicen
1441967 en un fin de semana se pierden dos partidos y parece que lleg un hurac n entonces por m s que pida paciencia creo que no es un punto de partida para lo que este equipo necesita la paciencia gira en torno a los resultados en chivas los resultados siempre tienen que estar a la orden y estamos muy conscientes de ello
1441968 seguramente tuve varios soy una persona que tambi n se equivoca y reconozco que me equivoqu en alguna cosas tanto contra tecos como con barcelona espero que ya no vuelva a suceder pero son cosas que platicamos muy intensamente con el grupo de tal manera que podamos sacarlas a flote en el pr ximo partido
1441969 s sobre todo con barcelona hubo errores conceptuales en la parte t ctica ahorita lo platicaba con algunos de los muchachos s hemos ca do en errores de ese tipo pero creo que en determinado momento siendo el segundo partido y en un amistoso como con barcelona pudieran darse como normales y son muy corregibles aparte este equipo no padece de ese tipo de errores conceptuales
1441970 con m s raz n tengo que tener calma como la hemos guardado siempre a nadie le gusta perder en un amistoso menos con el barcelona pero debo darle la dimensi n que tengo que darle
1441971 tuvimos dos bajas las de bravo y maza rodr guez se agreg la de michel y la de arellano y yo creo que debemos hacer un an lisis del equipo a partir de eso aunque tengo fe en ganar el s bado
1441972 sabemos que los t cnicos vivimos de los resultados y yo no puedo estar pensando en que si no gano me van a cesar ni tampoco cuando fuimos s per l deres me sent a superm n no tengo temor por nada mi nico temor es que el equipo no juegue como yo quiero que juegue el s bado
1441973 ganar el s bado es la mejor respuesta que podemos darle a cualquier inquietud duda o desconfianza que se tenga
1441974 i dont know how much im allowed to say but im a very bad person

1442018 i have parents calling and saying they saw their child in the background of a picture of other children and he didnt look happy or his face looked red has he been putting on enough suntan lotion or i havent seen my child and i have seen a lot of other children is my child so depressed he doesnt want to be in a picture
1442019 in previous years parents would understand that we were out in the field with children and wed get back to you after dinner when we had freer time
1442020 now a parent calling at 11 will be off the charts if they dont have a response by 1 or 1 30
1442021 theyll give their child two cellphones so if they get caught with the first one just give it up and youll have the second one to talk to me
1442022 thats widespread not isolated i call it fading parental morality what theyre doing is entering into delinquent behaviors with their children and what kind of statement is that to a child

1442031 seeks fewer immigrants but a warmer welcome for those admitted
1442032 the problem is its difficult to know whats causing a change like this
1442033 but the one thing we know for sure is that the country is in a deep economic downturn if not a recession which means theres much less need for workers especially those providing services for the middle class
1442034 immigration is a market driven phenomenon and thats why immigration is beneficial to the economy
1442035 when we need them they come and when we dont they go home has enforcement had some effect perhaps but theres no question that the economic downturn would in and of itself have a huge effect in attracting fewer illegal immigrants and sending more home
1442036 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1442037 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian

1442042 it was a great game for us the last game before going into the olympic tournament we are happy that we played them and im sure they feel they got better from this
1442043 but at the end of the day we won the ball game and found a way to win
1442044 if this was the olympics today he would play but its not its just a warm up game and we are going to be cautious and make sure it is right

1442051 sports and athletics programs such as basketball dance and yoga should remain at the middlefield facilities
1442052 a lot of parents dont have an extended support system such as a family member or trusted friend they can call when they need someone to care for their children in an emergency
1442053 those situations can lead to neglect or even abuse we want to avoid that by making the alternative care we provide at the crisis nursery as accessible as possible

1442055 almost all our players play in europe so it would be much easier for us to join the six nations
1442056 but we are also in the southern hemisphere and it would be great to join the tri nations
1442057 but then we would never get a holiday because we would be playing tri nations when our clubs are on holiday and we would never get a break our clubs would not be happy and in this professional era they are our bosses it is a really difficult decision
1442058 the world cup was a really big thing for us but it is impossible to keep at that level if we only play six tests per year

1442070 she knows about my christian faith she just wouldnt ask
1442071 i want her to be happy and healthy and stay on the right path
1442072 if i discuss her relationship i say that i want her to be happy
1442073 i think if and when we do wed probably announce it after the fact as opposed to making any big announcement
1442074 we both wear rings and im giddy when i see all the pictures of people so happy standing there confirming the love they wish they could have expressed for a long time
1442075 im a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality and im proud of how the nation is steering toward that
1442076 was tricky part of the coming out process is figuring out who you like and what that means and how to act on it
1442077 being an actor reduced my level of anonymity i couldnt just go to some bar and walk in and ask someone out on a date
1442078 if i had any regret it would be that strange lack of anonymity that created panic within myself that i would be found out

1442084 cameron diaz is one of the greatest friend anyone can ever have she has so much love to give we also support each other through the bad times ive always felt like shes my big sister but at the same time i know that sometimes im wiser and a bit less naive than she is we just spend so much time having fun and laughing together thats what true friendship is about from star magazine print edition august 11 2008 star also has some more quotes from drew about her difficult childhood growing up with a mother who let her do whatever she wanted and a father who was losing his faculties from the way they work them into the article they seem like theyre from an old interview and i was able to find the original full quote but its unsourced ive never really understood how i should feel or behave in a relationship i didnt have the kind of childhood or family life that would have given me any perspective on what a happy home life or relationship would feel like my father was literally out of his mind and my mother was more like a friend than a real mom to me she would take me out to clubs and i wound up feeling like part of this very unreal kind of world although that was the only world i ever knew growing up
1442085 all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages

1442088 theyre a continuation of our efforts in security but theyre also a reflection of a changing threat environment
1442089 customers are always asking whats the most important thing to get done when we release security updates
1442090 the new exploitability index helps with that problem were going to give predictions on how exploitable each issue is
1442091 its another piece of information another piece to the puzzle
1442092 i think its usefulness will depend on the implementation and how accurate the predictions are but it should help emphasize the need to look at exploitability as one of the factors in deciding what to patch
1442093 mapp will give the protection providers a head start and should shorten the time between our updates and their protection we recognize that its a race
1442094 i dont have to tell you that this takes some people at microsoft outside their comfort level
1442095 but the problems in security today are so large that no one vendor can deliver a solution by themselves were pushing the envelope here
1442096 well do the reverse engineering in many cases that will id where the vulnerability is
1442097 you have to give them credit that theyre putting effort into the security process
1442098 its not a silver bullet to the problem but more information is always better both of these are kind of interesting and show that microsoft is being more proactive in the security space

1442113 i think the fed would rather wait until after the election before they consider raising rates
1442114 that will give them time to get a better view of the economy and see if financial markets have become less fragile

1442125 as the commander in chief he does not have to take the advice of the commander on the ground
1442126 as a general you dont necessarily say you have to listen to me
1442127 i mean what barack obamas saying is he appreciates general petraeuss judgment but hes got concerns that go beyond iraq
1442128 if you are saying to the commander in chief here is a strategy i believe that works we need to try this we should give it a shot you would hope that that commander in chief would take that seriously
1442129 it sounds like what tara is saying is shouldnt he at least say
1442130 third there is clearly a racial element given that all of the groups where obama is performing worse come among white voters

1442149 you wanna know how i got this cum stain on my back
1442150 hello nickelback i was wondering if you had a song we could use for this movie were making
1442151 theres no question in my mind that shes been ready for the job for a long time
1442152 i think the biggest challenge is going to be living up to the tradition
1442153 girls basketball at sehome has a longstanding tradition of success long before i came on as an assistant we need to continue that tradition with hard work and teaching the kids what it takes to be successful
1442154 shes a hard worker shes very knowledgeable about the game and she works really well with the kids shes a teacher on our staff so she understands how to teach kids
1442155 theyve taught me how important it is to go to coaching clinics to learn about the game and how to teach it colin really showed me how important it is to prepare for each game by scouting he showed me the importance of breaking down film and being as prepared as you can as a coach to help your players prepare for every situation that may come up
1442156 theres no question in my mind that shes been ready for the job for a long time
1442157 i think the biggest challenge is going to be living up to the tradition
1442158 girls basketball at sehome has a longstanding tradition of success long before i came on as an assistant we need to continue that tradition with hard work and teaching the kids what it takes to be successful
1442159 shes a hard worker shes very knowledgeable about the game and she works really well with the kids shes a teacher on our staff so she understands how to teach kids
1442160 theyve taught me how important it is to go to coaching clinics to learn about the game and how to teach it colin really showed me how important it is to prepare for each game by scouting he showed me the importance of breaking down film and being as prepared as you can as a coach to help your players prepare for every situation that may come up
1442161 we will have a target on our back just because well be wearing the name sehome
1442162 but graduating four players will definitely leave us with some big shoes to fill we have several kids coming back with experience who have been to the state tournament i think theyre ready to continue the tradition here at sehome
1442163 the six steps to dealing with liberal friends and family
1442164 we joked a little bit about it in the spring coaches meeting
1442165 i met with the coaches and told them they needed to have year like they did last year and everybody kind of laughed about it it turned out they outdid themselves
1442166 it was just amazing that every team did as well as they did
1442167 thats what im most proud of is how every team was competitive and thats what makes me so proud of this group of coaches
1442168 everyone focuses on firstplace state champions but every team did well for us this year it was just a phenomenal year allaround
1442169 a lot of people dont believe ill be able to survive teaching and not coaching at the same time
1442170 when next spring rolls around thats probably when it will be the toughest
1442171 right now im so busy and i have so much energy it feels good ive accomplished quite a lot and i think its a good time to take a break
1442172 that was very tough for me to make that switch
1442173 we had been doing very well in slowpitch we advanced to the state championship game seven times in 15 years
1442174 i think it was probably in the late 80s and we had just made it into the state championship game for the first time
1442175 i dont remember the year the score or who we played i do know that we got crushed 13 3 by kettle falls and my team still attempted to carry me off the field on their shoulders quite a task considering how big i am
1442176 when you look back you dont remember the wins the championships etc
1442177 what you remember is the people and the chance to see them grow and mature and be involved in their lives is much more important that the records god blessed me with a lot of good people to work with players coaches and athletic directors and i will always be grateful for that
1442178 i had back surgery two years ago and that kept me from doing things ive always done like hitting fly balls and throwing batting practice
1442179 fortunately ive had some really good assistants that have picked up for me
1442180 bob has been a big part of our athletic program for many years
1442181 hes done an excellent job of coaching for us hes won a couple of state championships in softball and done an excellent job of mentoring our student athletes
1442182 he was a competitive coach but he always did it with the utmost class
1442183 we had so many battles with bobs teams and you knew they were going to be well coached he always paid attention to detail with things like mechanics i always enjoyed coaching against bob because if you beat him you knew you did a heck of a job
1442184 i think that the one thing about courtney is that she is somebody who has kind of dedicated herself to the process shes an amazing athlete but she also puts the work behind it shes probably one of the hardest workers to come through the program and it shows on the court thats why she is who she is shes worked hard at it shell be missed were all really excited to see how she does at boise and watch her there
1442185 she just brings a complete player offensively and defensively shes a great rebounder a strong passer and a great finisher she runs the floor well her decision making is good she has a very competitive spirit and shes just a natural athlete
1442186 shes kind of the hammer on defense that other teams dont have
1442187 they had both positions available my dad taught in the shoreline school district and i have some family down there
1442188 im going to miss my colleagues and the students and the athletes
1442189 i initially thought when they x rayed it there that it was a broken fibula and they said it was just that
1442190 i went to an orthopedic doctor wednesday and he said he thought the ankle had shifted
1442191 i thought the recovery time would just be minor like four weeks
1442192 it hit me with the shock i was pretty bummed
1442193 the coaches have always been telling me i should try it and i finally decided to do it
1442194 i really just wanted to stay in shape for basketball but it ended up being a lot of fun i wish i had done it my other three years here
1442195 of course its going to be tough to see him go
1442196 you dont just go out and replace a coach like that but he has young kids who are starting to play the game and a family he wants to spend more time with he told me before the postseason started he was going out with the seniors he went out in a big way
1442197 its going to be tough to fill the swimming position quickly because its hard to find qualified coaches within the district for that sport its gotten even harder with some of the cutbacks that are happening
1442198 anyone who has watched him compete in other sports knows the kind of athleticism he possesses what everyone doesnt necessarily see is the effort he puts forth in everything he does any time you find a kid with that kind of desire and work ethic no matter how talented he or she is theyll find success in whatever he or she chooses andrei certainly has found it at meridian
1442199 hes a coach on the floor hes a guy who can carry out a game plan bradys been an exceptional role model for kids in our community i really mean that he never got a technical foul he plays with a good attitude hes a good teammate his sportsmanship is outstanding and off court he lives a disciplined life
1442200 mason is the most gifted athlete i have ever worked with in his two seasons of track he has established himself as not only one of the greatest middle distance runners in the state of washington but one of the top in the country his accomplishments and talents on the track along with his positive attitude and fun loving personality will leave an incredible legacy
1442201 colin flynn has an uncanny ability to relax stay focused and run his own races
1442202 i was planning working out every day getting going on the wsu summer workout schedule
1442203 ill probably rent a couple of movies and a couple of video games
1442204 the weather doesnt make me feel any better ill have to make the best of a bad situation
1442205 im proud definitely of what i accomplished and what my teammates accomplished
1442206 i think we all had a pretty successful senior season
1442207 as far as physical hes one of a kind with that size strength and speed
1442208 but its mentally and emotionally what he can do for a team its the ability to get a read on the situation and know what his teammates need from him
1442209 he has that knack hed know when to be funny and when to be serious and that definitely benefitted us it wouldnt have mattered if we had 12 seniors on the young meridian basketball team we still would have followed andrei
1442210 at that point i was as excited as anyone watching the game as a fan
1442211 we have some family friends who have told us we should do something like us
1442212 were hopeful that well have a good turnout it should be fun
1442213 the thing about them is just that they are so steady
1442214 they are always ready to play and they are not willing to give up they can be down but they are never out
1442215 the very last point i just sat there thinking did we just win
1442216 i still sometimes think back and wonder if we really did it its still hard to believe its been so much fun i think that is the most important thing just enjoying what were doing
1442217 they are a really good team and really good competition we had a pretty good feeling it was going to be the same as last year at state but with a different outcome
1442218 i was well aware of the shoes i had to fill were those of a legend in tim irvin
1442219 and before tim irvin there was another legend and that was bob dorr a quick glance just at the school records that were established during the dorr irvin era is enough to make your head spin i think every time in this new era that we are lucky enough to break one of those records which isnt all that often we like to think we are approaching upon excellence
1442220 and in my prospective there are just a handful of coaches i would consider to be legends
1442221 in my conversations with tim you could always tell how competitive he was
1442222 hes always strategizing and looking at things to figure out a way to give his team the best chance for success there is no down time for him hes always looking ahead and figuring out a plan
1442223 i always tried to remind them that this was their team
1442224 i let the kids have a lot of say in what we do i make the workouts but i tried to listen to how they wanted me to handle it and how they were feeling our cross country team runs together five days a week during the summer and that was something that they said they wanted to do
1442225 this past year at the class 2a state cross country meet our girls went out a little quick
1442226 they hung on for the state title but they didnt have their best performance he made an adjustment for his team in time for the 3a race on the spot he was always watching what other kids were doing and was a master at making sideline gametime decisions
1442227 i think one of the really really masterful coaching relationships has been tims relationship with bronwyn crossman
1442228 bronwyn is headed to the university of oregon which is the hallowed ground for middle distance runners to work with arguably the best middle distance coach in the country in vin lananna and she leaves as a state champion that final touch tells us a little more about the extent of the tim irvin influence to put that into context that doesnt happen everywhere
1442229 you didnt want to be called a wuss by coach irvin you knew he wasnt mad at you but you wanted to do better the next time he cared about his athletes and he wanted to see each of them succeed he did everything he could to make you successful and you always wanted to do your best to please him
1442230 we were just on the cutting edge of discovering what the girls could do in the mid 70s
1442231 before that the girls sports werent offered it was all new to us when i took over in 78 we combined the coaching for both programs and we found that really elevated the girls program
1442232 i told my wife i had the cross country dream again last night
1442233 i dont know why but for some reason i was at pasco getting ready for the state meet i know its time for me to step away and there are a number of things that ill be able to do now that im fully retired but there i was in my dream looking for ways to help our team win
1442234 ive learned to never say never and ive had some coaching friends that have had a difficult time staying away
1442235 i know it wont always be easy but i just feel it is the right time for me
1442236 it takes a lot of knowledge to be as successful as he was he is always thinking ahead and strategizing he can take a sophomore and not only see how good they are now but see what they are capable of becoming two years down the line
1442237 i never wanted to be someone to walk away when the cupboard was bare
1442238 we have some very good runners coming back next year the boys program is getting better and better and the girls team is going to be a contender i think its going to be an exciting time for girls cross country here in whatcom county bellingham and sehome both have good teams back and i think its going to be fun to watch
1442239 hes enthusiastic about running and hes a runner himself i have no doubt that he will do a good job
1442240 we were meeting the night before and we knew it was going to be close we were telling our girls that west valley wore blue red and silver and making plans for what they needed to do and our young girls said coach youre making us nervous so we decided it was best to just go out and run then they beat us by one stinking point it turned out west valley knew us better than we knew them
1442241 head coach alan doud said he didnt want to coach any more and asked me if i wanted to come back
1442242 that was a turning point if i had gotten that job at western i wouldnt have been available to take over the cross country teams
1442243 we had an incredible group of girls coming up in 2001
1442244 and they had an amazing run then we had another strong group follow right behind them and they kept it going one thing i think you realize after youve been a successful coach is a big part of it all is being in the right place at the right time
1442245 we had a run that made all of us look like some pretty smart coaches
1442246 you cant coach as long as i did and win state titles without a talented group of athletes
1442247 ive had a great group of kids to work with its cyclical you definitely need to have a coach who recognizes talent at a school and knows enough about how to bring it out but youre not going to get anywhere without that talent
1442248 and that was pretty accurate because it was just incredible ive never seen that before ive never seen a team go 1 2 3 4 5 at a state or district meet like we did that year we just had such great athletes that year and they were all great competitors
1442249 im going to miss competing against these other teams from the old northwest league
1442250 im going to miss that thats the thing i need to get out of my mind as i move on but thats a hard thing to do
1442251 is a techno geeky way to say flexible glitch free audio
1442252 the redesigned pulseaudio automatically adjusts the way it feeds audio data to accommodate system load and ensure the audio data is always ready when needed

1442270 children involved in sports should be encouraged to participate in a variety of different activities and develop a wide range of skills young athletes who specialize in just one sport may be denied the benefits of varied activity while facing additional physical physiologic and psychological demands from intense training and competition

1442275 inconsistent and inadequate medical care for hiv positive immigration detainees endangers their health and lives

1442278 particularly dangerous with many chronic care cases and es pecially for hiv aids patients
1442279 the department of homeland security says it spends millions to fulfill its legal duty to provide care to immigrants in detention
1442280 but until real steps are taken to ensure that detainees with hiv receive adequate care the most vulnerable will face unnecessary illness and even untimely death and until it sets standards that can be enforced homeland security cant guarantee proper care

1442282 when we talk about pushing a tests limit of detection or lod were referring to the signal to noise ratio
1442283 its really a matter of figuring out how to reduce the background noise and make the signal stand above the noise
1442284 we identified a location that has the maximal signal to noise ratio
1442285 by focusing on this signal rich point of light we extended the lod by two orders of magnitude
1442286 about 90 percent of our time was spent in sample preparation not actually performing the assay
1442287 with further integration and automation of the test the time could be reduced significantly
1442288 the optical sensor requires a more expensive set up because of the confocal microscope
1442289 so in a small dental or doctors office the electrochemical sensor generally would be easier and cheaper to use but to really push down the signal to noise ratio the optical sensor has the advantage
1442290 but the technology is advancing so rapidly its difficult to predict how the optical sensor might be used in the years to come
1442291 at this point it has certainly pushed the envelope for the limit of detection and this will be an important capability in advancing salivary diagnostics

1442299 the way to have good soldiers is to treat them rightly a private soldier has as much right to justice as a major general
1442300 we knew going into the season that it was going to be a struggle to keep the legacy up as far as the team title
1442301 but winning a state title was something i was shooting for thats something i was building toward and really wanted so there was that victory for me but not so much for the team it made it bittersweet
1442302 i was a little bit nervous just because i only had a one shot lead and i knew the girl behind me was aggressive and a good player because i had played with her before
1442303 but my coach always told me to shoot a number play your game and it will come to you
1442304 im pretty level headed i try not to get caught up in one shot i just move on to the next
1442305 the thing about them is just that they are so steady they are always ready to play and they are not willing to give up they can be down but they are never out
1442306 putting together an undefeated season like brandi and jill did is really difficult if they were going to lose it was going to be to a very good team they were never just going to lose focus and drop a match
1442307 i respect him for his positive attitude and the great sportsmanship hes shown to all the teams in our conference
1442308 erica was the type of player that made the other people on our team realize what they were capable of where some people might be happy just getting the ball over the net she was booming shots
1442309 when you have someone of maddies ability playing at no 3 singles you know its going to be a very difficult matchup for the opposing team
1442310 i think she was a real leader for our team what she does not only helps our team now but its going to set the tone for this program for years to come
1442311 mandy is best known for her doubles play but she is great singles player as well she is determined and smart one of the best competitors that i have ever coached
1442312 in my opinion molly is one of the top 2a players in the state singles or doubles and she still has a lot of upside
1442313 she and andrea have such great communication out on the court its something they work on but they do a great job they also do a great job supporting each other
1442314 i think she and anne really got the tennis bug this season they both have started to put in the time to really become better and were expecting big things
1442315 chloe has been an overachiever as a result of her work ethic she has had a positive impact on our team in terms of a passion for the sport and the desire to be the best
1442316 loni made a terrific amount of progress this year she was able to hit the ball with much more control she had a good year
1442317 amy is just a terrific competitor she has great concentration when shes playing and a terrific ability to keep the ball in play
1442318 she carried us pretty much this year she came in as our no 1 knowing she had some pretty big shoes to fill and helped us finish second at the district tourna ment and third at state
1442319 he just has a great ability to motivate athletes in indi vidual sports hes brings that focus and intensity and it comes out in his players hes really brought stability to that program
1442320 she showed a lot of poise determination and leader ship all season karly has improved dramatically over her four years as a mariner golfer
1442321 kinsey is a natural all around athlete and leader who has always shown an intelligent approach to the game of golf she exhibited a poise and maturity not seen often in a high school athlete
1442322 her skill develop ment and focus took a giant step this year earning her praise from com petitors and coaches through the season she will be a cornerstone and leader of our team next year
1442323 she doesnt back down from any shot she came into this season with something to prove and really showed that she has a lot of potential
1442324 brinn was the leader of our team she has a great capability for setting goals and achieving them thats definitely one of her strengths
1442325 alyssa was a tal ented asset to have on our team this season she has a good golf swing a very well balanced swing and a great attitude she was a pleasure to coach

1442331 we dont believe the security or privacy of these would be members will be compromised in any way
1442332 but out of an abundance of caution and in keeping with a policy of always leveling with our members we wanted to issue this warning regardless of which state law may or may not require it
1442333 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1442334 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals where criminals are able to breach computer security systems as alleged here they have enormous ability to cause harm

1442343 there are a lot of people who are leaving their cars on the mainland the cost of getting your car out here is so expensive now
1442344 we always wanted to ride bikes in the san juans
1442345 we started what we thought were the easier ones and were working our way up
1442346 my three favorite colors are here blue green and white
1442347 and i put together a jar of pennies and nickels and a bunch of fake money to try and buy his car he didnt sell it to me
1442348 ive probably built 30 or 40 cars over the years and probably 18 of the 19 cars running in the 1 200 class on any given night
1442349 lets just say when theres an accident at the track i usually dont get a lot of sleep
1442350 were always doing something with the cars and with racing its a total team effort to get the car ready to drive
1442351 if i ever have any ideas or questions about the setup of the car i defer to my dad
1442352 he has the experience he knows the equipment and my sister shes right in there as part of the crew making sure everything stays clean my moms roll is that she lets us go racing
1442353 you have to keep up with the new parts and technology to compete
1442354 if youre not keeping up with whats coming out youre not going to do very well thats just how it is
1442355 when we started building cars we were building them out of bedrails
1442356 really we would use whatever we could get to make it go around
1442357 im working on the car just about every night during the season this is what i want to do for the rest of my life
1442358 methanol is a little cheaper than diesel or fuel now which is pretty ironic because it used to be a lot higher
1442359 the cost of fuel has hurt things quite a bit as far as the traveling shows go but i think we still put on a good show
1442360 theres a lot more that goes into racing than what people see on the track on a friday night
1442361 you have to work at getting sponsors and after that you have to work hard to represent those sponsors
1442362 its definitely a wild ride getting into one of these things
1442363 there was a lot of anticipation trying to get here and doing it was a ride i will never forget ive always dreamed of racing a big car but actually being here at dirt cup is so surreal its almost like a dream
1442364 everybody is getting better and better and starting younger and younger
1442365 one day i hope im one of these guys who is a big name and i know im going to get my butt kicked by some 17 year old some time
1442366 physically it can be tough ive slammed into that concrete wall hard and had to be taken to the hospital ive broken both arms two times each but ive never thought about not racing
1442367 you have to sacrifice just about everything youre working on a car all week or at least three or four days a week just to make sure its done and ready for the weekend
1442368 my uncle used to race in a circle but my dad has always said he prefers to go fast in a straight line
1442369 racing on a circle track is just something i can do its one of my talents
1442370 the neatest part about family racing is that you can take your son or your daughter out racing and then work with them and teach them in the garage during the week
1442371 it really doesnt give them a chance to go out and get into the wrong stuff it gives them common sense confidence and helps them understand the way things work

1442386 as i walk in theyll be playing the panamanian national anthem i will be carrying a sealed letter from president bush to president torrijos validating my appointment
1442387 i think its going to be amazing to stand there at the palace with president torrijos as the ambassador
1442388 the playing of the star spangled banner will also be a moment i really want to savor to reflect on how much i love my country and what it means to be a united states ambassador
1442389 in what universe is the new york times considered an objective newspaper
1442390 and for an hilarious comment on the dinosaur medias love affair with obama lets go to the video
1442391 compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities
1442392 worrying level of inflation rates results largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level
1442393 developments in the global balance of demand and supply for food and energy
1442394 we know the international price of energy and other commodities they add additional pressure to inflation in china
1442395 the biggest challenge for the world economy as a whole is not the oil price as such i think there are mechanisms that will lead eventually to an equilibrating between demand and supply but it is trying to ensure a monetary policy framework for the world as a whole that does not build into it an excess inflationary impetus
1442396 repeating the mistakes industrialised nations made prior to the great inflation of the 1970s
1442397 while the dollar depreciation is helping to reduce the us current account deficit it has not been sufficient to alleviate imbalances and risks rather new misalignments may be emerging and risks may be shifting
1442398 with inflation a clear and present threat and with real policy rates in most countries very low by historical standards a global bias towards monetary tightening would seem appropriate

1442411 we are not entertaining immunity for anyone involved with this case
1442412 the state attorney our investigators are working together as a team as well as to find any information that is pertinent to this case whatever strategy they deem is necessary and appropriate thats the strategy that will be followed
1442413 we have not negotiated any type or come to them with any offers
1442414 our client has never stated ill tell you where shes at if you give me immunity anything stated about that is truly a misstatement
1442415 shes been in that car many times they are going to find dna evidence in the car if they didnt you have to question law enforcement if they did a thorough search of it or not

1442417 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1442418 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1442419 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1442420 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1442421 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1442422 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1442423 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1442424 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1442425 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1442426 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1442433 our hypothesis was that certain non toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ros would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda 7 il 24 and be safe for human use
1442434 we are very excited at the prospect of this chemoprevention gene therapy as a means of both preventing and treating pancreatic cancer and it has significant potential to move rapidly into human clinical trials

1442437 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1442438 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1442439 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1442440 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1442441 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1442442 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1442443 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 of coronary heart disease
1442444 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1442445 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1442446 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to reeducate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually

1442459 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1442460 i think by the time we get to the end of this year or early next year the inflation numbers will look a lot less threatening and i dont think the growth environment will be significantly improved
1442461 i found this to be a poorly disguised compromise between those who believe inflation pressures are coming down and inflation hawks who fear the fed is already behind the curve
1442462 the fed should be in a holding pattern for the next five months
1442463 this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged

1442480 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting with family members this morning
1442481 he was walking this morning and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible
1442482 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1442483 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1442484 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1442485 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1442486 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1442487 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1442488 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1442489 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1442490 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1442491 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1442492 and as i said theyve got a lot of obligations that they must fulfill in order for these sanctions to leave
1442493 the more ive seen the more critical i see the need is for the people in burma to be for the world to pay attention to the people of burma and for the world to put pressure on the military regime
1442494 i think it will be i think it would be good for these athletes who have worked so hard to see their president waving the flag
1442495 personally i dont think kids mind a bit of gore and danger in their nursery rhymes or fairy tales
1442496 dalton mcguinty was doing a favour for reporters afflicted with summer brain stupor
1442497 heres the news the ontario premier said helpfully after a speech late last month ontarians are coming together to more effectively assert themselves in the face of an unfairness caused by the financial arrangements between us and ottawa
1442498 the premier is always careful to say that he is a proud canadian and that he understands his province has been blessed by geography and circumstances that give it a responsibility to share its wealth
1442499 mr mcguinty has earned some concessions in the past three years but the broad ranging reform of fiscal relations he is seeking eludes him his efforts seem to resonate with voters who find the notion of a 20 billion gap easy to comprehend one opinion poll earlier this year gave him two to one support over federal finance minister jim flaherty in their war of words over ontarios economic strategy
1442500 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1442501 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1442502 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery

1442512 they felt it would be helpful if senior officials in government met with candidates who were from outside the province even outside the country in order to sell them on the promotion of the province what a great place it is to live and to work
1442513 i would challenge anyone out there to point to an example of where government has interfered at all with the academic autonomy at memorial
1442514 we have just deliberately not gotten involved we have not interfered in any manner at all
1442515 this was a situation where they invited us to participate and we did and we did openly and honestly
1442516 i honestly dont see anything wrong with that ms burkes involvement and i am sure the people of this province dont
1442517 weve been elected by the people of this province to be responsible for the public purse and the public treasury to make sure that its handled and its managed responsibly and thats all were doing here

1442520 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1442521 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1442522 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1442523 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1442524 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1442525 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence

1442528 i think the fed would rather wait until after the election before they consider raising rates

1442532 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1442533 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1442534 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1442535 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1442536 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1442537 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1442538 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1442539 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1442540 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1442541 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1442542 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1442543 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1442544 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1442545 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1442546 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1442547 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case

1442551 to listen today to barack obama its all dick cheneys fault
1442552 well be off foreign sources of oil in 10 years
1442553 obama always one step behind in taking a stand this was mccains idea and now obama is calling for a change in energy policy geez does this guy have any ideas of his own nope
1442554 obama voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by president bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure for which vice president dick cheney played a major role mccain opposed the bill saying at the time that it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry
1442555 this belies the fact that supply is not the problem just as opec has said
1442556 new drilling would not solve the problem today when the public needs it solved but ten years from now or later

1442558 critics of the offshore drilling plan noted that the energy department released data july 2008 showing that u s exports of finished petroleum products including gasoline diesel fuel and jet fuel soared to 1 592 million barrels per day in may the exports set a record for the month and were up 31 percent from a year ago

1442589 some actors surely have a chance in hollywood too i like til schweiger gedeon burkhard is a cool actor and i think both could work there well i also like daniel bruehl from goodbye lenin if i had a role for a german actor it would be great to cast it with one of them
1442590 about one in every three are either in the critically endangered or endangered category which means they could disappear in the next five to 10 years if we dont take the measures necessary to protect them
1442591 if we dont engage with these animals in the next two to three years then theres a real risk of them disappearing
1442592 we have a close connection to them we learnt about them as children we see them in zoos we see them in films we see them in the wild if we go out to look at them
1442593 they are just wonderful animals and i think we have a moral obligation to conserve them more than that they also can be the basis of the economies for many of these tropical countries
1442594 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1442595 mr solana will discuss it with representatives of the five plus one

1442598 there are very strong purchase drivers at work around mrm but there are also key barriers still in place
1442599 one of the most significant inhibitors is simply a lack of customer education even after learning about mrm and its benefits many companies find it difficult to sort through all of the solutions that have made their way to todays market as with any new technology a customer has to be very clear on the purchase criteria and then very disciplined in evaluating available offers
1442600 an apples to apples comparison is not always possible but a little digging will allow businesses to review each solutions features on a side by side basis the vendors integration and customization capabilities should also be closely considered along with post sale service and support

1442604 a handful of passengers from the lufthansa flight mainly business passengers have decided not to travel today the others will be booked on alternative flights
1442605 obviously if you are about to take a flight its not something you expect to happen so i imagine people are feeling a little bit shook up
1442606 our plane was sitting on the end of the runway with the parking brake on
1442607 it wasnt moving another aircraft came towards it and then collided with it touching it with the wing tip
1442608 basically we were taxing and then it felt as if the plane was skidding there was a big judder i looked out and the end of the wing had crumpled there was a dent in the other plane we were probably there for about an hour before we were taken off
1442609 it was a shock not a huge drama but definitely a shock unfortunately we were only away for a week now rather than being sat in the sun we are sat in the radisson hotel in manchester airport

1442637 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1442638 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1442639 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs

1442658 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1442659 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen

1442670 al gore has raised us 300 million to bombard the world with his message that all the energy in the us should be renewable in 10 years he is even running his ads during sponge bob square pants our children are watching this propaganda and are being forced to watch
1442671 please help us as much as you can to get this film out now
1442672 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1442673 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1442674 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1442675 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1442676 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1442677 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1442678 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1442679 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1442680 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1442681 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1442682 a young man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of this country
1442683 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1442684 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1442685 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1442686 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1442687 when it comes to ethics and showing that you have a real concern for ethical issues then what you do is make a check from your campaign organization that is sitting on as we all know that is sitting on a lot of money which came from these sources and give it away give it to charity
1442688 his failure to do so i think shows that he just doesnt get it when it comes to some of these ethical issues
1442689 overall father love appears to be as heavily implicated as mother love in offsprings psychological well being and health
1442690 the system is not just for compressing the data its a synthesis of advanced technologies and research into pedagogy
1442691 the sponsor could also contribute about 50 a month to the school directly to provide the power and net connections
1442692 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1442693 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1442694 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1442695 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be

1442708 angel will provide students a consistent place to go for class and school materials
1442709 the course syllabus student grades students end of quarter assessments of their classes will all be online in angel
1442710 central ohio technical college is addressing the challenge of making education available to all with positive action
1442711 we commend cotc for their dedication to continuous improvement and are pleased to welcome the college to the quickly growing angel community
1442712 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1442713 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1442714 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1442715 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1442716 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1442717 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1442718 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1442719 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1442720 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1442721 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1442722 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1442723 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1442724 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1442725 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1442726 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1442727 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1442728 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1442729 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1442730 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1442731 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1442732 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1442733 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1442734 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1442735 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1442736 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1442737 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1442738 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1442739 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1442740 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1442741 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1442742 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1442743 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1442744 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1442745 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1442746 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1442747 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1442748 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1442749 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1442750 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1442751 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1442752 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1442753 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1442754 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1442755 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1442756 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1442757 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1442758 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1442759 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1442760 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1442761 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1442762 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1442763 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1442764 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1442765 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1442766 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1442767 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1442768 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1442769 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1442770 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1442771 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1442772 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1442773 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1442774 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1442775 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1442776 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1442777 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1442778 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1442779 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1442780 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1442781 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1442782 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1442783 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1442784 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
1442785 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
1442786 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1442787 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1442788 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1442789 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1442790 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1442791 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1442792 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1442793 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1442794 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1442795 was a highly intelligent student with a strong interest in writing and poetry
1442796 my wife became very upset this afternoon she perused our conversations and found them very disturbing i also imagine it would freak your parents out too and perhaps the school officials not to mention the police
1442797 its that whole what society thinks thing that somehow the mere feeling that i enjoy communication with you is bad if you were a mom and you knew your daughter was up at 1 36 doing this you would feel pretty upset
1442798 id be hard pressed to explain to other adults my wife included the nature of our friendship
1442799 a strong public policy of protecting children who given their maturity level cannot be expected to control their emotions nor exercise the judgment expected of mature adults particularly those adults serving as teachers
1442800 unfortunately its not uncommon and the kids who are the most risk are the youth
1442801 a predator spends a lot of time building trust a lot of trust and thought on how to build that trust and nothing in the time it takes to destroy it
1442802 were consulting with the wake county das office about the case and keeping them apprised of the situation
1442803 i needed a book just like this for one of my kids
1442804 why are these girls going to care about some girl in a mud hut
1442805 i cant work or agree with anyone who fails to see me as human but i wish to hell people could see past politics and to the humans behind them
1442806 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1442807 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1442808 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1442809 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1442810 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1442811 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1442812 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1442813 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1442814 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1442815 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1442816 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1442817 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1442818 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1442819 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1442820 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
1442821 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
1442822 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
1442823 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
1442824 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
1442825 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
1442826 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
1442827 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
1442828 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
1442829 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
1442830 hell be returning this week to d c to push for energy solutions
1442831 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1442832 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1442833 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1442834 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
1442835 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
1442836 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
1442837 gro muskul s blond und gut aussehend ruderten in der college mannschaft und nahmen an internationalen rennen teil
1442838 er wirkte nicht wie ein profi ich kann das beurteilen ich hatte schon mit 15 meine eigene firma
1442839 i love it here and i want to be part of the team so im happy to have signed my new contract
1442840 je belandt dan in handel waarbij apparaten als tweedehands worden ge xporteerd naar afrikaanse landen die bij aankomst ondeugdelijk blijken te zijn ze eindigen op de schroothoop met alle gevolgen vandien
1442841 de overheid moet gemeenten opleggen alleen zaken te doen met bedrijven die spullen f netjes uit elkaar halen bij voorkeur in nederland of ze terugbrengen naar het kringloopcircuit waar het gerepareerd wordt en als tweedehands apparatuur aan burgers wordt verkocht
1442842 de nederlandse vereniging van metaal en elektroproducten nvmp regelt de recycling van elektronica die is ook de beheerder van het fonds dat met de verwijderingsbijdrage gevuld is als de gemeenten al hun oude apparatuur bij de nvmp inleveren gaat het goed
1442843 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1442844 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1442845 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1442846 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1442847 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1442848 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1442849 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1442850 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1442851 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1442852 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1442853 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1442854 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1442855 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1442856 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1442857 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1442858 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1442859 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1442860 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1442861 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1442862 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1442863 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1442864 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1442865 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1442866 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1442867 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1442868 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1442869 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
1442870 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
1442871 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1442872 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1442873 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1442874 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1442875 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1442876 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1442877 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1442878 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1442879 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1442880 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1442881 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1442882 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1442883 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1442884 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1442885 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1442886 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1442887 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1442888 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1442889 besorgniserregend ist dass sich das regime in zchinwali offen auf einen krieg vorbereitet nach angaben der s dossetischen f hrung sind in der region zchinwali in den letzten tagen bis zu 300 terroristen eingetroffen die b rger russlands sind
1442890 die russische seite wird die gesamte verantwortung daf r tragen dass banden vom territorium russlands auf das georgische gebiet eingeschleust werden russland wird auch f r die sch rung der spannungen in der konfliktzone und f r die weitere entwicklung in dem gebiet voll und ganz verantwortlich sein
1442891 das armeekommando sieht ein dass eine waffe wie brahmos ihrem besitzer den sieg im fall eines konflikts sichert
1442892 i began to hear the chilling screams of a woman next door why have you got a woman next door they told me there was no woman but i was unconvinced those screams echoed through my worst nightmares for a long time and i later learned in guantanamo from other prisoners that they had heard the screams too
1442893 our lord take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from yourself a protector and appoint for us from yourself a helper
1442894 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1442895 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1442896 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1442897 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1442898 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1442899 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1442900 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1442901 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1442902 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1442903 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1442904 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1442905 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1442906 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1442907 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1442908 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1442909 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1442910 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1442911 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1442912 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1442913 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1442914 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1442915 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1442916 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1442917 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1442918 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1442919 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1442920 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1442921 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1442922 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1442923 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1442924 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1442925 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1442926 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1442927 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1442928 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1442929 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1442930 glen played the most games as a hurricanes player and did so at a high level
1442931 we are honored to have been a part of his distinguished playing career and look forward to paying tribute to his accomplishments
1442932 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1442933 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1442934 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1442935 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1442936 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1442937 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1442938 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1442939 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1442940 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1442941 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1442942 as a person who is interested in people she is down to earth she is very smart i always say if you want something done just ask michelle shell get it done and get it done fast and if she doesnt know how to do it shell go find out and still get it done she likes people she can relate to people shes friendly she doesnt look down to people and she likes kids
1442943 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1442944 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1442945 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1442946 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1442947 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1442948 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1442949 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1442950 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1442951 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1442952 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1442953 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative

1442960 even though corporate earnings are under pressure airlines will never curtail investments in technology projects as they are closely linked to safety security and other operational aspects if they do so their airworthiness will be adversely impacted and it will send out the wrong message to customers

1442964 the launch of a new ticketing office in pune marks yet another milestone in the constant endeavour of kingfisher airlines to provide a superlative flying experience
1442965 the discount is being offered as the flights are the domestic leg of an international flight which is to say that the aircraft might be operating a mumbai chennai gulf sector flight which gives us the opportunity to fly people between mumbai and chennai before picking up more onward international passengers

1442979 the providential nature of what is happening on the campaign trail

1443066 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning without michelle he wouldnt be there

1443084 there are limits on what an individual can do in terms of brain power this naturally pushes people towards specialisation but specialisation works only if you can get access to all the individual areas of thought because people can connect sources of information so much more easily through new communications technology the process of knowledge discovery will get faster and faster
1443085 my point is that most of the technologies such as wind turbines or using hydrogen as a fuel that produce carbon less energy are technologically not particularly challenging in principle and have been known for a long time some for centuries

1443098 despite the torrential rains throughout central mexico which kept a large number of people from getting to the voting booths especially in the shantytowns and the countryside where the roads are not paved despite our limited funds and despite the media barrage against us the first stage of the consulta nacional went ahead as planned and it was an overwhelming success
1443099 the successive mexican governments without consulting the people have proceeded to privatize countless government services and public enterprises this has caused untold harm to the people especially to the poor we cannot and we will not allow more poverty unemployment frustration violence and destruction of our country that is why we will not allow our oil resources to be privatized the will of the people must be heard it will be heard
1443100 differs on 10 points with the plan submitted on april 6 by calder n and the pan
1443101 she and the calder n government are open to finding common ground and a common reform plan with all the political parties in mexico that genuinely wish to modernize mexicos ailing energy system
1443102 great progress had been made to come up with an energy reform plan that unites the country
1443103 we must not further divide the country and provoke both internal and foreign confrontation
1443104 sufficient strength to impose its vision or its particular plan it will be necessary to compromise
1443105 now that the debates are over it is necessary for the congress to take action it is time for all of us to act responsibly
1443106 there will be no more congressional takeovers ortega stated referring to the 18 day takeover in april by dissident prd legislators of both houses of congress to prevent the fast track vote on calder ns energy package
1443107 we will not participate in any further acts of civil disobedience now it is time for a vote to be taken by the elected representatives of the mexican people
1443108 the beltrones pri so called alternative plan is a carbon copy of the pan proposals
1443109 the plan is unacceptable in any form the so called differences are of no significance it is an alternative that would do the same thing as the calder n plan that is turn our oil resources over to private mainly foreign interests
1443110 the pri the pan and the prd can have all the leadership meetings they want but the final decision will rest on the outcome of the referendum if they fail to respect the vote of the people as expressed through the three stages of the consulta nacional we will not sit back idly we are prepared we will mobilize nationwide we will not permit the politicians to privatize our oil and destroy our nation
1443111 we will not allow foreign masters to take over the destiny and resources of our country the only master here are the people if the pri and the pan go ahead and seek to impose a vote in the congress we will be ready we will call upon the mexican people to mobilize in mass protest actions there will be huge mobilizations across mexico there will be actions of peaceful civil resistance to prevent the privatization of pemex and our oil resources
1443112 on july 27 the no to privatization vote was overwhelming it was a vote of rejection of the privatization proposals presented by calder n but it was also a vote of rejection of beltrones of the pri
1443113 there are two camps here one the one hand there are those who defend the nation the majority of the workers and people on the other hand there are those who seek to turn our oil wealth over to the interests of the multinational corporations the pri pan green party televisa carlos slim and all those who would seek to reach a consensus with the oligarchs
1443114 the political situation calls for preparing a national march to mexico city to stop the takeover of our oil resources
1443115 this political situation also raises the following question what kind of political organization is needed to assist the working people of mexico to safeguard their interests
1443116 the nation is not for sale pemex must be defended
1443117 we want to continue to be a free country we do not want to become a colony
1443118 we will not accept the privatization of pemex in any form whatsoever

1443120 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1443121 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1443122 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1443123 they clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1443124 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1443125 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1443126 this seems highly suspect to me a report by the rwandan government how do we know the motivations of these officials

1443150 a good geothermal energy source has three basic requirements a high thermal gradient which means accessible hot rock plus a rechargeable reservoir fluid usually water and finally deep permeable pathways for the fluid to circulate through the hot rock

1443153 the issues at the va medical center in little rock were detected by va employees revealed through investigations by the food and drug administration and vas office of research oversight and ultimately referred to vas office of the inspector general
1443154 this is an example of va detecting and fixing its own problems
1443155 the issues cited in vas inspector general report are being addressed through an aggressive action plan the little rock research program is under heightened scrutiny to ensure no recurrence

1443161 the five plus one proposal has a number of ambiguities that the iranians feel that until they are resolved properly iran cannot respond properly to the proposal itself
1443162 iran is trying to resolve these ambiguities and i think this letter is part of that process
1443163 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures

1443203 what happened to the no left turn at the tim hortons at the transit and michael anthony lane intersection
1443204 i thought it was conditioned by the town that no left turns could be made into the tim hortons from transit road
1443205 they cut the dividing driveway median and now they can do anything they want
1443206 that was part of the site plan approval that it was conditioned that no left turns could be made into the tim hortons by vehicles traveling south on transit road
1443207 how did they ever get the approval to do that
1443208 as it was a state highway tim hortons went to the dot and got permission to reconfigure the driveway
1443209 in other words all the conditions the town sets can just be thrown aside by the state
1443210 this is a pretty substantial change a change that negates a condition that residents fought for traffic safety reasons then within six months this change is allowed

1443215 we had a warm winter followed by a rainy spring which caused high levels of planktonic plant life to develop
1443216 this meant that the oysters were particularly well fed and spent a lot of energy developing their sexual organs to the detriment of their natural reserves leaving them vulnerable to oshv 1

1443237 this is the first time that water was so high in st lucien road in 2006 our house was flooded and we lost our microwave and fridge
1443238 there is a lot of development taking place on the hills but the drains have remained the same and therefore cannot accommodate the volume of water
1443239 years now diego martin is flooding and they are doing nothing about it
1443240 we lost over 3 000 in items due to the floods
1443241 renewed immediate inspection of all existing bridges to see if there is any possibility of a problem with an existing bridge
1443242 the fact of the matter is even though the bridge was built by another government another minister of works i am the minister of works now
1443243 i have to deal with this i assume that if anybody else was the minister of works they would have to deal with it
1443244 it is not a question of where the buck stops this is a ministry of works bridge assembled by ministry of works workers and was in the process of being disassembled by ministry of works workers so definitely all of us in the ministry have to take responsibility for this
1443245 i have one regret and that is that i hid my problems from my relatives
1443246 the reason was that i never wanted to worry them but i urge all women to speak out against abuse or you could end up like me or worse i was lucky but the next woman may die
1443247 i have to heal on the inside and outside before i think of a relationship
1443248 i could never forget that day he dragged me into his car and drove me to a lonely road where he ordered me to kneel down
1443249 with a cutlass over my head the man told me if i cant have you nobody can then the chops started
1443250 this should never have happened a bridge should not fall either during construction or worse during removal this just should not happen
1443251 mommy im very sorry for the embarrassment i have caused everyone
1443252 i apologise for the embarrassment i have caused and i am sure that this wont happen again

1443256 i think there is a parallel between san jose and detroit
1443257 it took the red wings three years of playoff experience to finally win the stanley cup as a team we had gained experience from losing to edmonton in 2006 and anaheim in 2007
1443258 i think there are three types of teams in the nhl
1443259 there are teams building for the playoffs teams expecting to make the playoffs and teams expecting to win the stanley cup san jose is like detroit in the latter group
1443260 the fans ownership management and players expect to win the sharks have had several successful regular seasons but not in the playoffs the pressure to win here will be similar to that in detroit where the pressure to win every year is immense
1443261 whether a player has one goal or 600 goals players want to score we talk offense even in our own defensive zone but thinking offensively doesnt mean you are not responsible for other areas away from the puck
1443262 to get over the top we have to deal with pressure in the playoffs
1443263 i think the team has dealt with that this summer we have brought in rob blake they have all won stanley cups
1443264 i havent really paid attention i just plugged it in at the beginning of the summer and left it
1443265 weve done studies and found that people are over watering with automatic sprinkler systems up to about 50 of what they should be using

1443267 people that water every day yeah they will find that they will have problems because their roots arent very deep and this is the worst time to cut back that much

1443312 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1443313 we have our own class action going now well its being set up its not in court yet but we do hope that this current government now will give full recognition to our service and give us full access to the veterans entitlement act
1443314 we want full recognition of servicemen who have had hazardous service equal to that of serving in vietnam or iraq or anywhere else and full entitlement to access to pensions and the gold card
1443315 we want a health study on our widows and our children our offspring they will need ongoing and continuing support
1443316 the government has planned it this way and by government i dont necessarily mean just the labor government
1443317 when you change the government you change the politicians but you dont change the bureaucracy and its the same bureaucracy and its defendants exist now that existed in the 1950s when the tests were on in top secret
1443318 obama will never investigate the bush administrations well documented criminal activity
1443319 what i would want to do is to have my justice department and my attorney general immediately review the information thats already there emphasis mine and to find out are there inquiries that need to be pursued i cant prejudge that because we dont have access to all the material right now i think that you are right if crimes have been committed they should be investigated youre also right that i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of republicans as a partisan witch hunt emphasis mine because i think weve got too many problems weve got to solve
1443320 so this is an area where i would want to exercise judgment i would want to find out directly from my attorney general having pursued having looked at whats out there right now emphasis mine are there possibilities of genuine crimes as opposed to really bad policies and i think its important one of the things weve got to figure out in our political culture generally is distinguishing between really dumb policies and policies that rise to the level of criminal activity you know i often get questions about impeachment at town hall meetings and ive said that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances now if i found that there were high officials who knowingly consciously broke existing laws engaged in coverups of those crimes with knowledge forefront then i think a basic principle of our constitution is nobody above the law and i think thats roughly how i would look at it
1443321 so i guess im saying that emotions play an important role in thinking about what the legal system should be doing but under our constitutional order we go back and forth between the emotions and the legal requirements and thats a way of guaranteeing fairness and as i say very important to have a degree of bipartisanship with respect to subsequent investigations all emphasis mine

1443366 the sad part is a lot of people wont be surprised its tragic its sad all we have to do is have one our ships hit and a bunch of americans killed and one or two news stations say it was the iranians and the countrys going to be ready to go to war theyd even be willing to call a draft to say we have to go to save israel we have to march in so we need a draft thats the worst part that i fear

1443379 team a hasnt given me a reason to move them down
1443380 my preseason predictions are more important than what ive seen on the field
1443381 team a was my pick at the beginning of the year so im sticking with them
1443382 team a has a really good win on its resume now
1443383 okay its the preseason so it really doesnt mean anything unless its 2004 and youre auburn
1443384 we are just out here enjoying it trying to feel that good breeze thats coming in
1443385 weve fared this pretty well thank god weve had a lot worse
1443386 i love him but my opinion of him right now is much lower
1443387 if you tell a player that hes not wanted he goes to his manager who says thats great and then they try to get out of the club and the club gets nothing for them but he might be put up for trade you never know even if hes got a contract
1443388 no doubt someone would want an alan didak so the club might be playing the smart game and saying all right hes at the club hes got his suspension if we go public saying were going to sack him now we dont get anything for him at the end of it it doesnt help the cause
1443389 ive got no worries with the philosophy of the club i have been a bloke who has been pushing that things havent been hard enough but ive got no worries with it now
1443390 i said i thought they should have gone all the way and sacked didak but this still hurts them and i think it hurts them more now that they miss out on the game that they love and now they have got to work hard and win back the respect
1443391 it is something that obviously during the discussions yesterday and this morning we addressed do these players deserve to be part of the collingwood football club
1443392 we dont have any resolution on that and thats something that will be evaluated at the end of the year
1443393 could those players be traded yes we will review that at the end of the year
1443394 i wouldnt think so that it would happen at north
1443395 i think were all pretty responsible we all know what to do lifes all about choices and youve just got to make sure you make the right ones
1443396 i dont really think it would happen here were a pretty good club so i dont reckon it would happen here
1443397 its pretty important this time of year you want your best players playing
1443398 theyre probably just as around the mark of the top eight as we are so they want their best players playing
1443399 we do have great faith in our players and we rely on them to make the right call at the right time
1443400 it does crystallise that in football there is a ripple effect for everything that happens it shows the players impact on the sponsors on the club on the media is far reaching so if anything we hope that our players learn from what happens
1443401 his football abilitys pretty good but i dont know about him if he came here if they got him here well see what happens but hopefully that doesnt happen

1443411 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1443412 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
1443413 my view is that if we have a vote lets make it a rational policy
1443414 we cant let republicans hold this issue hostage because of one vote
1443415 the current debate seems to be bogged down in partisan one upmanship
1443416 its grossly unfair to the democrats who want a vote
1443417 this is a not a new issue this just didnt happen today weve been working on this for months

1443419 we have a plan and we will stick to it
1443420 a commitment to public reporting and transparency can make the real difference in improving safety healthcare quality and patient engagement
1443421 this important set of measures can help us track progress toward improved safety and coordination of care across clinicians and settings
1443422 given the known gaps and variations in care for patients infected with hiv aids and hepatitis b and c it is imperative that the medical community begin to systematically measure itself at the individual clinician and system level to identify where improvement efforts are needed
1443423 the nqf process is instrumental for endorsing a single set of consensus standards that will help alleviate the multiple competing sets of measures for hiv aids and hepatitis against which clinicians are currently measured this supports our ultimate aim a uniform standard of care that every consumer can expect
1443424 all stakeholders including employers physicians and the government are looking for endorsed standards like these perioperative performance measures that are feasible reliable and valid
1443425 the harmonization of measures achieved by the nqf committee will hopefully result in a more clear understanding of the utilization of these important vaccines
1443426 setting standards for how we measure vaccination rates will help us raise the bar
1443427 not only will we know how many people are accepting vaccinations but also how many are refusing them this way we can improve our strategies for vaccination set targets for improving rates and measure our success in addition the new health care worker standard is an important first step to increasing vaccination rates in this group which would reduce the spread of influenza in health care settings

1443532 why do you oppose bushs tax cuts but not clintons 1997 tax cuts clinton cut taxes on capital gains which certainly is good for the economy but is far more skewed towards the rich than income is why dont you describe clintons tax cuts in more detail for me
1443533 tax cut for the rich see p 5 of http www cbo gov ftpdocs 77xx doc7718 effectivetaxrates pdf
1443534 our emergency rooms are closing down because illegals do not pay
1443535 there is no excuse to not sealing the border other nations know how to seal their border and it is not a complex undertaking at all 2000 miles of border 10 guards per mile only 20 000 guards needed
1443536 they pay into soc security while their parents dont draw from it
1443537 intervals that it takes for per capita world gdp to double
1443538 also i said it would not cause a recession in the broader economy and it has not and it will not after 15 months i have been proven right and you have been proven wrong
1443539 i challenge you to prove either of these two statements wrong
1443540 i dont like what it says as it conflicts with what i want
1443541 yes i read translations of the russian press and they do express their opinion freely there and they do criticize putin as much as we do bush so no biggy
1443542 my tribe is not ruling the wrong people are making money clearly we are on the brink of some disaster
1443543 by 2040 well have run out of hay to feed our horses and flint will become so rare that well no longer be able to make arrowheads to hunt our mastodons
1443544 100 oil what a scientist would say to an investor
1443545 1 that rising oil prices do not cause a long term downward adjustment in demand oil demand may be inelastic in the short term but in the long term people will buy more efficient cars carpool ride bicycles reduce discretionary trips conduct more commerce online etc to assume otherwise is to ignore the most basic law of economics
1443546 2 that rising grain prices will not move consumption away from increasingly expensive meat towards affordable grains fruits and vegetables thereby reducing grain and water demand this too is economic illiteracy
1443547 3 that there will be very little technological innovation in alternative energy automobile efficiency batteries or information technology from this point on
1443548 4 that most economic growth is now in knowledge based industries which consume far less energy per dollar of output the us economy today produces twice the financial output per unit of oil consumption as it did in 1975 with information technology rising as a portion of total economic output
1443549 5 that a major economic downturn featuring skyrocketing food prices for people in poorer countries will somehow not translate to a lower birth rate that inhibits population growth and hence curbs demand and that population projections will somehow not change
1443550 6 that there will be no humans living beyond the earth whether in orbit or on the moon by 2040 i say that advances in photovoltaic efficiency make lunar colonies closer to viability by that time
1443551 7 that we are going to have over 30 years of negative growth in world gdp despite not having had a single year of negative growth since 1973 and despite the trendline of growth solidly registering at 4 5 a year even today
1443552 fossil fuels are currently the most economically available source of power for both personal and commercial uses petroleum fuels our cars and thirst for plastics while natural gas and coal heat and electrify our homes mass transportation is also largely propelled by fossil fuels in 2005 more than 3 4 of total world energy consumption was through the use of fossil fuels petroleum led with over 43 4 percent of the worlds total energy consumption followed by natural gas 15 6 percent and coal 8 3 percent north america is the largest consumer of fossil fuels utilizing nearly 25 percent of the worlds resources
1443553 my main dispute is the claim that the world of 2040 will be much poorer than today and that car ownership will be rare i dont think you are advocating that as a realistic outcome
1443554 exergy services can be equated to exergy inputs multiplied by an overall conversion efficiency which of course corresponds to cumulative technological improvements over time based on this hypothesis economic growth from 1900 to 1975 or so is explained almost perfectly except for wartime perturbations
1443555 dead wrong choose whatever measure you want from life expectancy to un human development data to infant mortality to nutrition to vacations taken the world and the us are much richer than 30 years ago all these are data beyond gdp
1443556 it has been 16 years since the demand for cod led to the collapse of the once superabundant cod fisheries in the north atlantic off newfoundland disappearing with them were some 40 000 jobs other deep sea species have already been depleted the orange roughy formerly known as the slimehead and the chilean sea bass aka patagonian or antarctic toothfish
1443557 have an economy that matches the us economy in size if the us grows by 3 a year for the next 22 years it will be 30 trillion in 2008 dollars by then china with an economy of 3 2 trillion in nominal not ppp terms would have to grow at 11 a year for the next 22 years straight to achieve the same size which is already faster than its current 9 10 rate if even that can be sustained for so long no country let alone a large one has grown at more than 8 over such a long period
1443558 we do expect an increase in the pace of appreciation of the yuan through the balance of the year
1443559 large scale reconstruction of buildings roads and other infrastructure in the earthquake zones may push fixed asset investment growth higher
1443560 the impact on consumer prices may be short term but one should not ignore the impact on upstream producer prices as demand increases in the near future for cement steel copper aluminum and other construction materials needed for reconstruction
1443561 you would be hard pressed to find any non russian who thinks russia will be the 3 superpower in 2030
1443562 the rise in the ppi threatens to feed through into sustained higher levels of cpi even as food prices the main contributor to the current bout of inflation stabilize
1443563 severely battle any creation or any spreading of rumors that would upset or frighten people or cause social disorder or illegal criminal behavior that could damage social stability
1443564 were at the start of a massive boom in chinese security spending
1443565 and just as we need to be aware of how to profit from the growth in chinas commodity consumption we need to be aware of companies that will profit from security consumption theres big money to be made
1443566 chinas golden shield corporations and the development of surveillance technology in the peoples republic of china
1443567 a gigantic online database with an all encompassing surveillance network incorporating speech and face recognition closed circuit television smart cards credit records and internet surveillance technologies
1443568 it was clearly similar to what we were condemning china for
1443569 waiting times for simple procedures are next to nonexistent as opposed to the months long waits in socialist countries
1443570 the united states would still be the sole world power
1443571 typically in the past when americas economy has weakened the rest of the world soon flagged but this time the rest of the world has speeded up even as the american engine has lost steam gross national product per person is now growing faster in the euro area than it is in america domestic demand is also booming in emerging economies in asia the middle east and russia and most of chinas growth comes not from exports but from domestic demand
1443572 america used to be the worlds biggest exporter first it was pushed aside by germany and now it has been outclassed by china in global finance too america and the dollar are being shoved off their pedestal the dollar is still preferred as a reserve currency but it is no longer the favourite form of cash for households and firms there are now more euro s in circulation than there are dollars my italics in the international bond market the euro has displaced the dollar as the main currency wall streets stockmarket capitalisation has now been eclipsed by europe combined with russia
1443573 including unfunded promises made for medicare social security and federal retirement programs u s taxpayers have a total debt of 59 trillion thats 516 000 for every u s household
1443574 the nations average personal savings rate fell to negative 1 in 2006 meaning that americans spent more than they earned
1443575 last year when treasury debt increased by 184 billion almost half of that amount was provided by lenders in china china is the largest source of funding for the united states governments deficits
1443576 only 4 of the total money came from american investors and institutions
1443577 their fastest growth these days lies in europe africa the middle east south america and elsewhere in asia in other words practically anywhere other than the united states
1443578 agency to invest its immense reserves in foreign currency some analysts say the formation of the new agency means china is moving away from heavy reliance on investing in united states dollars through treasury securities the new york times march 10 p c3
1443579 i have seen the classified only reports and based on those reports i believe that we as a nation are at risk of major failure should our army be called to deploy to an emerging threat
1443580 this nation has got to replenish and fix what is soon going to be broken
1443581 under current plans it will take two to three years after the iraq war ends my italics to restore equipment levels it will take five years and at least 75 billion for the army to increase its active duty ranks as planned up to 547 000 soldiers
1443582 the backlog of veterans disability claims stands at more than 405 000 with cases averaging 177 days to be processed experts estimate that an additional 400 000 claims will be filed in the next two years
1443583 care facilities for american troops and their families are buckling under the strain of war and funding limitations
1443584 there is no argument of whether the u s army is rapidly unraveling
1443585 joseph e stiglitz nobel winner in economics co authored a study that predicts the iraq conflict alone will eventually cost taxpayers more than 1 trillion counting military rebuilding and health care for wounded veterans
1443586 the war bill is going directly on the nations credit card
1443587 with gasoline at 5 gallon consumers will migrate towards hybrids plug in hybrids and electric vehicles so rapidly that the auto manufacturers will start engaging in aggressive competition to lower prices and accelerate innovation this will greatly widen the fronts at which the oil market is exposed to the far cheaper and decentralized electricity market this spells trouble for oil producers who have to compete with electricity that is 3 5x cheaper in providing the same transportation
1443588 then the fun begins the terrorists and despots who got lured into profligate spending under 120 oil will eventually find that the demand for their exports is plummeting furthermore the thing about subsidies such as those that iran doles out is that they are self propagating note that in 2005 iran exported 44 billion in oil but spent 25 billion in subsidies meaning that if oil fell to 30 barrel irans export revenue would effectively become zero if the same level of subsidies are maintained 34 cent gallon gasoline leads to more car purchases and hence more demand for gasoline increasing the cost of maintaining the subsidies and hence the oil price floor at which irans export revenues would shrink to zero at 120 barrel the subsidy obligation will be so burdensome that even a drop back down to 70 barrel would lead to a revenue falling behind expenses at the same time china will have no choice but to aid in the hastening of these technological advances as they will have to shift their priorities from locking up oil contracts to reducing the crushing cost of oil imports at 120 barrel
1443589 but out of 8 news networks if 7 are left wing and just 1 is right wing and even that network contains liberals why does fox news bother you so much if only 1 out of 8 news networks caters to half of the population yet you want to suppress even that that means you are opposed to free speech doesnt it how is what you seek even remotely fair
1443590 if only 1 out of 8 news networks caters to half of the population
1443591 the left thus still controls 7 out of 8 news networks
1443592 and the fox news are highly opionated which is really bad tell me do we need opionated news or news told us in a neutural way your own sentence proves the point of the article which is that your type obsesses over fox
1443593 they will of course either quickly change the subject or attack you personally with childish insults
1443594 it seems like you are on the holy war of bashing the left wing
1443595 excuse me why does my sentence prove the point of the article
1443596 i just think they should do better job of delivering news not
1443597 i have not decided which side i am on in the wot
1443598 no josh you are calling one oversight a crushing defeat
1443599 if i were a copy a perfect copy how would you know i wasnt really me
1443600 the suffering populations have little or no redress for the unforgiveable harm being allowed
1443601 to expect china to radically cut emmisions in their growth period is absurd unhistorical immoral and un capitalistic
1443602 china is immoral slavery and pollution abounds humans and the environment must not be made to suffer to gain an economic advantage
1443603 the chinese economy seems to be demonstrating very similar disquieting symptoms
1443604 ill agree with harsh on this one we as americans cannot simply be in favor of free markets only when it suits us that is indeed unamerican that is why i slam those who demonize outsourcing
1443605 we must support the free market throughout i never liked us farm subsidies as it punishes us consumers as well as poor farmers worldwide only to benefit iowa farmers so they vote for the pork giving candidate in the iowa primaries thus us consumers and indian farmers both suffer
1443606 the chineese concept of capitalism is corrupt and communist there is no level playing field when the red chineese keep bankrupt state enterprises running full speed
1443607 the chinese economy seems to be demonstrating very similar disquieting symptoms
1443608 bringing in phony high end material is actually more lucrative than smuggling drugs
1443609 in the slavery scandal authorities say nearly 1 000 children and adults were abducted and forced to work in brick kilns operators beat and starved workers often with local government protection
1443610 i think it would be better if the media would stop playing up this issue
1443611 any bias against products with a made in china tag does injustice to chinese exports overall good quality
1443612 i think it would be better if the media would stop playing up this issue
1443613 world citizen is just about the last person who is qualified to comment on democracy he actually refuses to admit that burma iran russia north korea etc are not democracies
1443614 i am 100 percent anti abortion with no exceptions i believe all life is precious
1443615 abortions should be legal only when the pregnancy resulted from incest rape or when the life of the woman is endangered
1443616 i would vote for him so many others would too
1443617 in short he is an unthinking right wing extremist with no chance whatsoever of attaining elected office outside the backward cesspool of louisiana politics
1443618 i would vote for him so many others would too
1443619 im kind of shocked by the amount of hate and intolerance towards countries youve mentioned
1443620 that btw is the true measure of the quality of a country the net difference between those wanting in vs those wanting out
1443621 look at how poorly russia scores in democracy vs america
1443622 linking partially the oil prices with the food prices corn ethanol and soia diesel and more make immediately painful for the petrotyrants the new prices
1443623 but the issue here is the flow of migration between russia and the us
1443624 that would be nice but unlikely in such a short time
1443625 your economist link still ranks russia at a lowly 102 out of 167 so not very different from freedom house russia being lower than venezuela liberia and thailand where there was recently a military coup is actually worse than i expected
1443626 if you look in more detail what drives the score is functioning of government and political culture
1443627 russia is still below mexico and in human development an even more expansive measure than gdp russia ranked just 65th 10 points below mexico
1443628 that may be but it still means russia is not a democracy
1443629 chavez as just as much of an authoritarian dictator as castro
1443630 you cant take one piece of an index that you like while excluding the ones you dont like at a full composite level mexicos hdi is better than russia individual components may vary but the total is what matters
1443631 in democracy russia ranks at a composite of 102 out of 167 from your own source that is not a very compelling ranking saying it is a democracy but not a liberal democracy is meaningless
1443632 perhaps chavez executes fewer people than castro did but he has changed the constitution to make himself dictator for life and taken control of the press i provided a link with many sources
1443633 even then only 1200 died in katrina far less than the 15 000 in france and 20 000 in italy as well from a mere heat wave
1443634 wrong that is propaganda from the foreign media i provided points on why so many mexicans again a country with a higher hdi than russia still come to the us to do low skill jobs
1443635 in theory yes but the best features would be 80 from the us and 20 for europe and the 20 in europe would mostly be from ireland and possibly denmark sweden
1443636 so heres my prediction you tell me the price of oil and ill tell you what kind of russia youll have
1443637 the point is russia has a lower hdi than mexico and apparently cuba which is already considered to be a poor country
1443638 a ranking of 102 out of 167 being solidly within the hybrid regimes group is vary far from being a democracy or even a flawed democracy cutoff at rank 81
1443639 gee why might he have done that if he remains in power for 30 years do you actually think it is because people voted for him throughout
1443640 he has shut down free speech of those who want to have him removed through the democratic process refer back to point 1 to see a pattern here
1443641 chavez is in the same bracket as castro and arguably worse than pinochet was
1443642 given your defense of authoritarianism in both russia and venezuela it appears that there are very few dictators that you would find troubling
1443643 if anything it shows that 15 20x more die in france italy from a mere heat wave than from a city being submerged in the us the large gap between the us and europe was displayed for all to see
1443644 being poor in america is still a more compelling life than being middle class in mexico or russia
1443645 rather i would say america is better at matching income with contribution
1443646 yet the curious thing is that european society at least in the nordic countries is far less stable than americas if one compares the incomes of children with those of their parents or considers how long people in one income group stay there nordic countries emerge as far more mobile than america britain shows more class stability than its northern neighbours but it is still a lot closer to them than it is to america the obvious explanation for greater mobility in the nordic countries is their tax and welfare systems which especially when compared with americas deliberately try to help the children of the poor to do better than their parents one might expect social mobility and economic flexibility to go together in fact to be two sides of the same coin but to the extent that redistribution is an explanation it implies the opposite that social mobility is a product of high public spending a bit like the low incidence of poverty or longer life expectancy on both of which europe also does better than america the other part of the explanation seems to be their superior education systems education has long been recognised as the most important single trigger of social mobility and all four nordic countries do unusually well in the school appraisal system developed by the oecd that in turn may explain why the bigger continental european countries notably france germany italy are not as mobile as nordic ones with relatively poor education systems they are bound to perform more like britain but that still makes them socially if not economically more flexible than the land of the free for europe the secrets of greater social mobility are first tough redistribution policies that particularly benefit those at the bottom and especially in nordic countries a more supple and less class ridden education system running from top to bottom america could learn something from that
1443647 wrong the us has 17 of the top 20 universities in the world far more graduate students come to the us from europe than vice versa also a higher percentage of americans have bachelors degrees than in europe
1443648 there are far more female executives in the us than europe
1443649 blacks in america have a higher per capita gdp than whites in france or sweden
1443650 very wrong if that were the case people would be leaving america for europe which even poor americans do not do in fact many more europeans still come to america
1443651 sweden and denmark would not be able to apply their models if they had millions of illegal mexicans draining the system without contributing the influx of arabs into scandinavia threatens their future greatly
1443652 give bush administration more freedom and remove major opponents russia china european union and i easily predict the world situation in the nearest future
1443653 cuba has a higher hdi than mexico which in turn is higher than russia yes
1443654 the actual quantitative ranking supercedes your subjective opinions on how low the bar for democracy should be set at
1443655 he isnt it world help if you get your facts right
1443656 once again it is proven that other than america almost no other country will fight for the freedom of others
1443657 these two technologies in combination will cause the consumption of oil across the us and even china would drop dramatically and permanently within just a few short years
1443658 we know what we are but we know not what we may become
1443659 thus at this half way point i am re affirming my prediction that we will see victory in iraq by 2008
1443660 indicating the near complete ideological convergence between anti us fifth columnists and al qaeda
1443661 the biggest challenge will be convincing enough people that it is indeed a victory as per the measures above
1443662 first off i know whats going on in iraq from first hands my relative happens to be there third term front line
1443663 the evidence now shows clearly that saddam did not want to work with osama bin laden at all much less give him weapons of mass destruction
1443664 there has been a glaring unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders
1443665 america continues its desperate struggle in iraq without any concerted effort to devise a strategy that will achieve victory in that war torn country or in the greater conflict against extremism
1443666 desperate attempt by an administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war
1443667 there is no question america is living a nightmare with no end in sight
1443668 america has not been fully committed to win this war
1443669 there is nothing going on today in washington that would give us hope
1443670 president pervez musharrafs crackdown against extremists is unlikely to ease political pressures on his government
1443671 the heavy hand displayed in the governments dealing with radicals occupying the lal masjid red mosque and its renewed commitment to fight extremism while improving musharrafs standing with moderate secularists triggered a backlash from religious conservatives
1443672 it reminded me a bit of london in the 1980s when you were getting ira bombs
1443673 frankly the risk was very small and people kind of shrugged it off and had a fatalistic attitude to it
1443674 when you drive around the streets its absolutely business as normal markets are full people are really not worried about this
1443675 the fundamentals of the pakistan equity market look fairly attractive
1443676 once the political uncertainty has cleared and our feeling is that it may by the end of the year this is a market that asia investors should have on their radar screens
1443677 pakistans economic expansion initially bankrolled by a positive money supply shock has transformed into a domestic consumption boom that is both bonafide and self sustaining
1443678 the deployment of a nuclear weapon by enemies in north america or a us occupied state will result in a green light for the us to use its nuclear arsenal
1443679 you can convert any gas vehicle to an electric one for 10 000 now
1443680 remember that if 200 000 000 americans usa is the 1 of earth pollutants if you didnt know switch to electric cars the north and south poles stop melting less people will have asthma and less people will die from the lung cancer are you ready to make the difference
1443681 you can convert any gas vehicle to an electric one for 10 000 now
1443682 so where does this leave us converting a gas car to electric can cost between 5 000 to 7 000 to do it yourself or 10 000 to 20 000 to have a conversion shop do it for you if you compare this to the price of a new car today evs can be cost competitive
1443683 so it appears some people think the list is too optimistic while others think it is too pessimistic this could be a sign that it is close to the weighted average of expectations
1443684 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
1443685 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1443686 the apostle paul and the introspective conscience of the west
1443687 cults and cosmic consciousness religious vision in the american 1960s
1443688 are at risk of worsening disease more symptomatic days and reduced quality of life as a result of these environmental changes
1443689 we need champions throughout the world who will work to put protecting human health at the center of the climate change agenda
1443690 have what it takes to stay in al east race
1443691 this is my livelihood i want to make a name for myself
1443692 i also have to do it for boxing canada this is make or break if i do well in this tournament it can do well for our future fighters in this country
1443693 i dont want to call it a monkey on the back
1443694 i dont think we came back with the thought of fixing something so much has changed
1443695 the further you get from the athens regatta the less important it becomes i think that has evolved in the last three or four weeks the closer we get to the first race the less important is the last four years
1443696 i cant worry so much about the medal we are going to win
1443697 i think we have to win by the fact the team is a great team as a unit
1443698 if you are not prepared for the olympics its quite overwhelming
1443699 ive already walked through this pass before and i feel much more prepared
1443700 if they are seeing canadian fighters for the first time they dont know us from adam
1443701 its important you come familiar with the different countries and different system with fighters in those countries
1443702 we noticed when they were out there but we noticed when everyone was out there
1443703 there is that feeling we owe them one when you are out on the course you try to be as sharp as you can
1443704 they came in they spoke of bonus money and royalties
1443705 they never said anything about pipelines whatsoever or any of the other bad things that weve learned about
1443706 in the past drilling was not taking place in the heart of the city
1443707 now were having all the problems associated with gas drilling compressor stations pipelines drill pads theyre taking away our green space theyre bringing in pollution theyre bringing in truck traffic affecting our neighborhoods in a very negative way
1443708 theres hundreds of thousands of dollars coming into here theres jobs being created
1443709 well i think we pay those journalists whether on channel 8 or channel 11 or the star telegram in terms of advertising support
1443710 we see this as pretty much instead of running the ads on the program were just writing the check direct
1443711 with all the lipstick you put on it its still a pig
1443712 it is still a media campaign for the company to get people to sign their leases
1443713 people are drinking a higher quality product whether theyre going from a seagrams to a grey goose vodka maybe theyre celebrating their big paychecks working out on the barnett field
1443714 and i think if you spoke to the fire chief today hed say we probably evacuated unnecessarily
1443715 you know so much of this is unknown and yet it is commonplace in west texas taking rural mentality and bringing it into a municipal area and those two often dont mix
1443716 for it to be more than that the thief would have to hack into two different passwords and even then would not get what identity thieves want most a social security number and or credit card information
1443717 les clients nous disent quils aiment woody allen quils veulent mission impossible 3 dans leur monture ou quils veulent la photo dun acteur connu puis nous la fabriquons ici et leur exp dions
1443718 people are hurting because bush has sent the economy into a ditch and norm coleman has been riding shotgun the whole way
1443719 we need a change in this country and im going to bring a change
1443720 more than anyone else i know the difference between talk and results
1443721 you have to ask of each candidate what have we done in our lives to merit serving you in the u s senate
1443722 i love our country and i cant stand what the two party system is doing to our country
1443723 its dragging us down its heading us in the wrong direction
1443724 if we can do that we will no longer be held hostage to saudi sheiks and others who are not our friends
1443725 were talking about wind were talking about biomass and bioefuels were talking about rail were talking electric hybrid cars
1443726 we need to have a massive reinvestment in renewable energy and the winner will be rural minnesota
1443727 were not going to deport 12 million people thats absurd we couldnt do that if we wanted to
1443728 i think this is the ticket right here i might have to get a bag of those
1443729 thats why were going to change it but first i have to get elected spread the word
1443730 padahal rp 20 juta saya pakai buat modal awal tanah saya di kampung saya jual
1443731 dulu tempat ini gelap dan rawan banyak kabel kabel yang dicuri pembunuhan ada juga yang diperkosa tapi karena ada kita jadi aman
1443732 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1443733 the school district is defined by what happens in the classrooms not by what is said in the boardroom i have had the opportunity to see firsthand some of the difficulties our teachers face each and every day and it has helped me appreciate why our istep passing rates are below those of suburban districts thats a gap we must strive to close for all students across the district
1443734 i could not support such a massive property tax increase especially considering that taxpayers were already staring down the barrel of record increases due to changes made at the state level
1443735 there is significant work that needs to be done on our buildings but we need to develop a plan that taxpayers can afford and support
1443736 we need to do what is necessary to keep the buildings viable but above all the district needs to re establish funding to the capital projects fund to allow future upgrades and repairs to be done on a pay as you go basis
1443737 student achievement remains the number one priority and the balance score card now gives us benchmarks that we can use to quantify our progress as we move forward
1443738 in the elementary schools is where we will first have to concentrate resources
1443739 we also need to develop student accountability in the middle schools before the high schools can improve i look forward to working with jon and all the other board members as we tackle the issues that are critical to the success of our students and ultimately our community

1443754 my fathers greatest achievement was to recover from the horrors of that war and to emerge as a decent man
1443755 many people were not able to do that he had nightmares for the rest of his life but it wasnt something he liked to talk about we just hadnt pictured him throwing grenades and bayoneting his way through german trenches but we now know that is what he did
1443756 ridley actually went over the top on two occasions the first attack at delville wood was a horrible experience but somehow he managed to come away unscathed the second time he wasnt so lucky
1443757 his battalion had been sent to attack the gird trench near gueudecourt
1443758 they were dispatched without any proper reconnaissance being carried out
1443759 a lot of the battalion was wiped out by machine gunfire but ridley and the other survivors simply had to make their way through the trench armed with bayonets and lobbing bombs he was hit on the head with a rifle butt and fell to the ground
1443760 the german soldier than lunged a bayonet at him but he managed to save his own life by directing it into his groin rather than his stomach
1443761 he was unconscious for a while but did recover then a soldier lunged a bayonet up his hand and through his wrist he passed out again
1443762 we can only assume that the german soldier was killed at around the same time because ridley obviously survived
1443763 i think in some respects the experience during that war was even worse as he talked about it even less

1443766 what about a different society that does not rely on continually exploding cheap sic to produce things for profit yes you would not have a car and you would not be flying off to faraway places for your jollies you would not have lots of pre packaged food furniture would be expected to last as opposed to be chucked out to rot away into methane on a landfill site
1443767 and for the car drivers of london and big cities use a bike or bus
1443768 he said he hoped to appeal and would also be considering whether legal action under human rights legislation may be possible
1443769 if he wants redress a law suit for unfair dismissal is the way to go
1443770 what youve got here is a private company deciding that having a bnp councillor on its books is bad publicity and bad for business
1443771 its also almost universally reviled for good reason and considered radioactive by employers
1443772 presumably based upon the anecdotal evidence that the union grassed him up
1443773 id say public contempt for the bnp runs at between 90 and 95 of the population
1443774 the only people who would advocate pro employee anti business legislation of this type are well to the left of the labour party
1443775 okay so you dont speak big grown up thats fine
1443776 even if 15 of the public are at least well disposed towards the bnp that still means that the vast majority of the bus companys customers are not
1443777 as demonstrated though the people youre talking about are not pc leftists but are in fact the uber capitalist owners of the bus company
1443778 what activists and pressure groups so far as i can see the only people cited in the report are unison
1443779 a local political campaign for a party that is detested by a very large proportion of the companys patrons

1443786 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1443787 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1443788 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1443789 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1443790 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1443791 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others
1443792 so if theyre learning about aggression and angry words at home they will tend to use these behaviors as coping mechanisms when they interact with their peers
1443793 has served as one of the primary contributors to its persistence and severity
1443794 sticks and stones will break my bones but words will gt
1443795 we can see the strained yet still ordered interface structure that opens up a wide pathway for ions to be conducted
1443796 the new layered material solves this problem by combining two materials with very different crystal structures the mismatch triggers a distortion of the atomic arrangement at their interface and creates a pathway through which ions can easily travel
1443797 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1443798 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1443799 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1443800 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1443801 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1443802 i think if they really build one of these quantum computers there will definitely be resonators in them
1443803 our position was clear as mayors and i honored that this morning with no agreement on the per diems i couldnt support the millage
1443804 i think we all said no for now that certainly would be an indicator of my vote
1443805 its not that we dont need the jail the fact is we still have time to pass the jail millage and solve this problem
1443806 maintain what is effective adapting in simple ways to higher complexities when necessary
1443807 whats interesting to me is that this exact study was done in 1988 and given to the usga it was disregarded now 20 years later its considered valid
1443808 the second quarters activity continued to play out to broad themes in the market one secular and the other more cyclical
1443809 first is the growing acceptance of pipes by large cap companies as an efficient vehicle for quickly raising capital in distressed situations a trend that has been apparent since early 2006 second there is a market based decline in traditional micro cap company activity since late 2007 as those issuers struggle with low share prices and increased risk premiums required by pipe investors
1443810 investors demands for increased protection in micro cap deals are influencing their structure
1443811 although economic times have cast a cloud over wall street many firms have looked to the pipe market to meet capital requirements and continue to grow their companies over 75 billion has been raised in the first two quarters of 2008 through 691 deals which is the largest amount of investment in a similar period in the markets history healthcare technology and energy sectors remain the most active while financial institutions have found refuge in pipes raising over 51 billion in a period when capital markets are in turmoil and some sectors have ceased to function altogether the pipe market continues to thrive

1443820 it is this maybe that holds us down and shakes us up and wakes us up and pulls us under it is this maybe that we stake our entire future on it is this maybe that will cause our children to grow up and either resent or respect us it is this maybe that makes me both proud and ashamed of who i am

1443904 the social psychology of police interrogation the theory and classification of true and false confessions

1443906 the only way to become a true craftsman is to slop on comfy clothes and do it every day for years and years
1443907 brick walls are there for a reason they give us a chance to show how badly we want something
1443908 although current guidelines recommend that measurements of bone density be repeated once every 2 to 3 years our data suggest that at this rate of testing the average person would exhibit changes well below the margin of error

1443912 youd think that sort of trial would have been done by now but it hasnt
1443913 this is a nobel prize winning question if someone can figure it out
1443914 hopefully in the near future well have some more concrete evidence that speaks to the question
1443915 we dont believe the security or privacy of these would be members will be compromised in any way
1443916 there is no reason to believe this is anything other than the simple burglary of a laptop which the local police are investigating
1443917 we would certainly support an increase in the cost of living adjustment
1443918 ill tell you we get calls every week from retirees pleading with us to find some way to increase their pension every dollar counts for these folks
1443919 a lot of our retirees are upset and theyll be even more upset when i tell them the state is going to get a raise and theyre not
1443920 when you think about it these people are being stretched thin too
1443921 i think it was a good time because its not costing us any extra money this year
1443922 is it wrong to enhance their pension by 10 a month no but do we have the money to do that absolutely not so what are we doing
1443923 what seems like a very small change has an enormous cost because of the numbers and there has been no public hearings or analysis done about whether the state can afford this because it cant
1443924 employers should be careful that they are going to get sued they are treating employees unfairly in the first place and wasting human resources in the context that they are relying on these weight based stereotypes
1443925 this is what weve hoped for for years to come out
1443926 hes looked at the stereotypes and proven that they are not true
1443927 you cant simply flush peoples lives down the toilet because you are worried theyre going to get sick
1443928 we know that several looked for an affordable policy but many had a pre existing condition that made it unaffordable
1443929 these were not the poorest of the poor because they get coverage through medicaid or the city contract with shands jacksonville
1443930 health coverage is not something you expect to have so having it was something that was fantastic and a perk
1443931 i think it was one of jacksonvilles proudest moments when it started offering jaxcare to small businesses
1443932 we started the program thinking that cost is so low and coverage is so good people would come to the door
1443933 well be able to intervene earlier its a way less costly system to get more people access to routine care
1443934 the decrease in aerosols probably accounts for at least half of the warming over europe in the last 30 years
1443935 a 17 year old man was referred to the inpatient psychiatric unit at royal childrens hospital melbourne with an eight month history of depressed mood he also had visions of apocalyptic events
1443936 the patient had also developed the belief that due to climate change his own water consumption could lead within days to the deaths of millions of people through exhaustion of water supplies
1443937 if we do not begin reducing the nations levels of carbon pollution australias economy will face more frequent and severe droughts less water reduced food production and devastation of areas such as the great barrier reef and kakadu wetlands
1443938 with this issue we kick off a debate concerning one of the main conclusions of the the united nations international panel on climate change ipcc
1443939 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
1443940 when i started that job in 1999 the evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming seemed pretty good
1443941 the evidence was not conclusive but why wait until we were certain when it appeared we needed to act quickly but since 1999 new evidence has seriously weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming and by 2007 the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon played only a minor role and was not the main cause of the recent global warming
1443942 if there is no hot spot then an increased greenhouse effect is not the cause of global warming
1443943 you cannot deny there is a connection here something bigger than us

1443947 as an artist and a christian i understand the difficulty in reconciling the two and finding our place in life the church often times ignores or rejects the relevance of the artist in the work of the kingdom while the world rejects the perspective of the christian in culture t can be a disheartening place to live but as christians and as artists we are called to persevere we should not forsake the gathering together of like minded believers but also seamlessly make our way out into the world as salt and light taking part in and befriending and supporting the culture christian artists should be the first ones in the door at gallery and museum openings we should be seeing participating in and dialoguing with those artists and whats going on in the artworld organizations like civa who desire to bring together the church and artists and to speak with relevance to all are providing a great service to the culture we live in and the one to come

1443950 oh the gloriously discrete and probing hints she made along the way as clever as my own sister how subtly she plumbed me for my own sense of self without prompting me to admit before my own awareness that i am what i am
1443951 i am unto the fourth world as adam was unto the third i am the spirit become mind to create spirit as he was the spirit become flesh to create mind i am the breath of new life man was the innumerated artillery and we shall be the arrows that strike into the schemes of the devouring center
1443952 gaya needed to know what i was and she gave me a name you wish only to know my name for you can see what i am your eyes show more than the flesh but i ask you man what do you see when you look in a mirror

1443957 er ist ein ungew hnlicher spieler wir sind sicher dass er die ohnehin schon starke mannschaft komplett machen wird und zudem einer der zur h lfte von spanischem blut ist
1443958 gebt mir zwei monate und ich werde interviews auf spanisch geben k nnen
1443959 dina versucht noch das richtige datum f r die hochzeit auszumachen so wie es aussieht wird sie aber ende des jahres stattfinden
1443960 monatelang haben sie ihre beziehung geheimgehalten und sich als gute freunde bezeichnet aber sie haben festgestellt dass es sich nicht nur um ein kurzes liebesabenteuer handelt es ist f rs ganze leben und das wollen sie jetzt der ffentlichkeit zeigen
1443961 dass es dort auch nach den olympischen spielen solche anschl ge geben wird weil die ursache nicht beseitigt ist durch die spiele im gegenteil es wird auch danach probleme geben weil die soziale ungerechtigkeit in china sich vergr ert und die beziehungen zwischen der zentralregierung und den minderheiten versch rfen sich
1443962 kann sie einsetzen um proteste von demonstranten die sich f r mehr demokratie einsetzen im keim zu ersticken

1443964 the joy of the summer is theres less traffic on the roads and its mango season
1443965 theres a whole legion of us that go crazy when marilynn has mangoes
1443966 the hatcher mango is around for a couple of months each year then thats it
1443967 the hatcher mango is not stringy at all and has a thin seed
1443968 once she discovered hatchers she was so thrilled she was addicted she would send them to me when i lived in nebraska now i am keeping up the family tradition i send them to my kids
1443969 once you find something that is a real winner and a treasure you take full advantage of it
1443970 the imports are actually boiled it takes all the aroma and flavor and the pulp is rubbery
1443971 you have to drop everything else you are doing and concentrate on mangoes
1443972 you cant let the mangoes sit very long they have to be moved
1443973 mangoes grow in a clump you might have a ripe one and some green ones
1443974 the trick is to grab that single mango from the clump
1443975 dont stand under a bunch of ripe mangoes they will hit you on the head
1443976 i am proud of my father in law for coming up with this mango
1443977 people tell me they have never tasted anything like it he started something special we cant let it die weve got to keep it going
1443978 they are perfectly the same as their daddy i am in heaven here i am a happy person
1443979 our immunity is stimulated by being exposed to the chicken pox when that stimulation goes away our protection is going to decrease so well see more cases of shingles my guess is that were going to be giving doses of the varicella vaccine to 30 and 40 year olds to prevent shingles the better we do eradicating chickenpox the more were going to see shingles
1443980 obviously when he told them that there was a bench warrant and they were going to be arrested they became alarmed
1443981 out on the street when you have those profiles you can sell them for anywhere between 150 and 300 to the next tier up or the next level up in an identity theft organization
1443982 unfortunately there are some members of society that tend to prey on the elderly
1443983 the most vulnerable people in our society that were supposed to take care of because of all the years they sacrificed to work are the ones that are being targeted and thats unconscionable
1443984 appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations of how dangerous anthropogenic global warming is blah blah blah blah
1443985 already around the arctic circle this is uh a famous village in alaska shows a photo of a house about to go over an embankment this is a town in newfoundland shows a video of a home going over an embankment while gore pauses for for maximum dramatic effect as the house goes down the hill
1443986 the wetlands behind my house didnt have any way too drain said cyril sheppard
1443987 i think that a lot of this is caused by that water seeping into the sub soil and the waves on the other side just make it worse
1443988 all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent
1443989 no doubt we are all gonna freeze to death from gl
1443990 september 11 has become the catch all excuse for virtually every proposed expansion of government power
1443991 one example is a national identification card and data base long desired by some in government and which was mandated by legislation passed by the congress in 2005 with the support of both senators mccain and obama although i was no longer in the congress when this bad legislation was passed i had vigorously opposed it in the years since it became law just as i led the successful effort to rescind a previous mandate for a national id card
1443992 the real id act establishes a new and privacy invasive national id card program by forcing states to standardize their drivers licenses and creating a vast national data base of private information on the citizenry the law establishes through the back door something americans would never have accepted directly a national identification card
1443993 there was no open and honest vote on real id the mandate was slipped into a supplemental appropriations bill discouraging any real debate over the issue
1443994 creating anything close to a national id card threatens americans basic civil liberties and privacy while doing little or nothing to make us more secure
1443995 means higher fees longer lines and greater inconvenience for americans getting a drivers license the burden on states which have to redesign and remake state licenses and include all manner of information on citizens applying for new drivers licenses would be extremely high and immensely costly since they would have to restructure computer databases security systems verification measures and more
1443996 tougher government reforms than any other candidate in this race reforms that would eliminate the kind of no bid contracts that this administration has given to blackwater
1443997 most contractors act as if the law doesnt apply to them under my plan if contractors break the law they will be prosecuted
1443998 we have to crack down on private contractors like blackwater because i dont believe they should be able to run amok and put our own troops in danger and get paid three or four times or ten times what our soldiers are getting paid
1443999 the developers goal is to fit more than 100 zombies onscreen at once i do that that it may be possible to attain this goal but capcom will not be able to have the same visual polish at the 360 linkage
1444000 he proceeded to describe to the group a very long and detailed homicidal plan
1444001 that he had bought a bulletproof vest had obtained a gun a very detailed plan to kill his co workers
1444002 my daughter was involved in a little theater in frederick
1444003 and whenever she was in a musical she would walk into church and ivins would be at the piano and he would start playing a tune from the musical she was in just as a quiet sort of hello
1444004 he was leaning over the table and i was on the other side of the table and he leaned forward and was just really excited at how finely milled the powder was
1444005 they came in they spoke of bonus money and royalties
1444006 they never said anything about pipelines whatsoever or any of the other bad things that weve learned about
1444007 in the past drilling was not taking place in the heart of the city
1444008 now were having all the problems associated with gas drilling compressor stations pipelines drill pads theyre taking away our green space theyre bringing in pollution theyre bringing in truck traffic affecting our neighborhoods in a very negative way
1444009 theres hundreds of thousands of dollars coming into here theres jobs being created
1444010 well i think we pay those journalists whether on channel 8 or channel 11 or the star telegram in terms of advertising support
1444011 we see this as pretty much instead of running the ads on the program were just writing the check direct
1444012 with all the lipstick you put on it its still a pig
1444013 it is still a media campaign for the company to get people to sign their leases
1444014 people are drinking a higher quality product whether theyre going from a seagrams to a grey goose vodka maybe theyre celebrating their big paychecks working out on the barnett field
1444015 and i think if you spoke to the fire chief today hed say we probably evacuated unnecessarily
1444016 you know so much of this is unknown and yet it is commonplace in west texas taking rural mentality and bringing it into a municipal area and those two often dont mix
1444017 itll take 10 years to get any oil from new drilling and it wont help
1444018 geloven moet je zelf doen en het liefst in de kerk
1444019 you moron what kind of stupid assed answer was that

1444021 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
1444022 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1444023 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1444024 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1444025 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1444026 extremely so if you have kids but everyone should have one no matter how old you are
1444027 they cannot implement a survival plan when the disaster is knocking on their door
1444028 we really dont think about some of these things until you watch tv and see some of these things happen
1444029 you just have to be prepared it really is so so critical its extremely important that people have a plan and i dont think that the majority of them do
1444030 the biggest thing that weve tried to teach logan is keep your head
1444031 most people assume they will be there for their household
1444032 parents overlook the fact that they may be the ones that are injured
1444033 you should prepare for any emergency in your home whether its fire flooding or anything like that
1444034 in the area of governmental regulation this is the second worst thing that can happen to a hospital
1444035 the only thing worse is if the state or federal government takes away the hospitals license to operate
1444036 unfortunately these are not that uncommon we found something that needs to be corrected immediately something that puts patients in jeopardy
1444037 most times the facility will correct what needs to be corrected to remove that certain situation
1444038 we believe that conditions within fort walton beach medical center posed an immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of patients
1444039 executive leadership was at the hospital all weekend long and planned to respond to the ahca by today
1444040 a plan of correction will be given to the state by the end of the week
1444041 they should be submitting their plan of correction to the state by close of business today
1444042 work with ahca dcf and cms to achieve a plan that will be accepted by all
1444043 individuals in need of baker act screening and placement will be redirected to the bridgeway center inpatient treatment services unit for the duration of the moratorium
1444044 our community relies every minute of every day on fort walton beach medical center
1444045 we need that hospital and we need it functioning and compliant with all state and federal laws so it can function
1444046 i personally have 100 percent faith in wayne campbells capability to respond and lead the hospital through this unfortunate incident
1444047 its challenging having a professional career your parent not living close to you having family and finding time to take care of your needs as well
1444048 it does affect the bottom line if people dont pay attention to what theyre doing they make more mistakes
1444049 part of you is absent the part of you able to focus and get the job done
1444050 its not just kids dealing with their parents theres a lot more spousal caregiving youre still working and your wifes had a stroke
1444051 if you excise caregivers from the workplace you wouldnt have a workforce
1444052 executives cannot keep turning their back on aging issues and caregiving comes with that
1444053 it takes a cultural change if a middle manager experts you to be in your seat eight hours a day performing youre never going to say anything to anybody
1444054 how do i avoid being seen i need to work but i also need to be at home
1444055 were glad to have you in the workforce if youre a caregiver here are some numbers to call
1444056 its important to seek support from people who are close in your life people you know you can get emotional support from
1444057 if youre not in a healthy place youre really ineffective for everyone
1444058 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1444059 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1444060 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1444061 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1444062 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1444063 if we fail to act there are severe indications for national security our economy and our environment
1444064 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1444065 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1444066 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1444067 wow this is my style of coding man it has a name associated with it
1444068 when using a debugger it becomes a pain to inspect the value if you follow that coding style
1444069 if they dont speak our language or they do something thats culturally unacceptable like keeping chickens in their back yard that further isolates them
1444070 i tell them you can trust the police department here its not like in your country
1444071 i bring police over who speak their language spanish ukrainian vietnamese
1444072 i dont think it is fair to a guy who is 75 yesterdays 75 is not the 75 of the 1950s if you stop screening and treating men at 75 you are going to have a lot more people dying of prostate cancer
1444073 the problem is that we cant tell which ones are really bad
1444074 we could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1444075 at this point we recommend that men make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference
1444076 we know that prostate cancer is a slow growing disease and years ago used to say that 70 might be the cutoff now that the population is aging and remaining healthy we are extending that to 75
1444077 this is another piece of evidence to present to the patient
1444078 age in and of itself is not a definitive determinant of whether you should be excluded from treatment

1444082 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
1444083 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
1444084 secret activities that the government would not like to see disclosed
1444085 it turned out that there was quite a bit of stuff that was unaccounted for
1444086 and two that were labeled unknown an army euphemism for classified research whose subject was secret
1444087 zack left fort detrick in december 1991 after a controversy over allegations of unprofessional behavior by zack rippy lab technician charles brown and others who worked in the pathology division
1444088 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him he was a world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for over 33 years with the department of the army we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
1444089 can you tell who here is tutsi and who is hutu
1444090 oh we were just noting that this was the place we were stopped by a road block while fleeing to congo from the genocide they were checking ids for ethnicity and taking the tutsis to be killed they checked the first five ids those of my husband and children which were all hutu just before flipping to the next one mine which is tutsi the man said thats enough and let us pass god was with us that day
1444091 well we think within 2 years the rebels will come back across the border so you better come back soon
1444092 ich hoffe dass wir es im wesentlichen hinter uns haben
1444093 ist viel leidenschaft zu sp ren was die partei jetzt braucht ist augenma

1444095 es ist einfach seine unertr gliche arroganz sein auftreten als graf rotz die ihm nun zum verh ngnis wurde
1444096 eine gro e koalition ist schwierig weil die erkennbarkeit der parteien darunter leidet
1444097 ich w nsche mir also keine gro e koalition ausschlie en aber sollte die spd nur eine koalition und zwar eine mit oskar lafontaines partei
1444098 ich w nsche mir eine koalition von sozialdemokraten mit sozialdemokraten auch wenn das gelegentlich die komplizierteste koalition ist
1444099 diese frage stellt sich mir nicht die hybris dar ber nachzudenken hat herr wulff ich habe sie nicht

1444107 i am delighted to be associated with a brand like nakshatra that has garnered immense popularity not only in india but worldwide i hope this association is amiable and mutually profitable
1444108 katrina is the perfect representation of the young trendy and fashionable woman that nakshatra targets she lends a refreshing look to the brand we are excited about having her on board as the new face for nakshatra

1444110 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1444111 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1444112 if there is a subtle shift in the risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern

1444117 i was scared of spiders and bugs and i hated anything gross
1444118 the most important thing that happened to me in college
1444119 after i went on ascent i felt more at ease when i got back to school i learned a lot about myself and that theres no harm in trying something new i left with a good group of friends and a better sense of what gettysburg was all about
1444120 aw fuck we totally forgot about that so with any luck i should be rolling out this afternoon
1444121 this whole experience makes me feel like a kid in a sweets shop im just taking in everything with a little look here a little taste there my favorite part of the gifting suite id say the bling skullcandy gave out necklaces with silver or gold skull shaped charms thats what we all need bling bling bling
1444122 the best things that i got in the gifting suite are these skullcandy headphones and a swag filled backpack that ive yet to explore ive been up all night though and im still sort of drunk so i dont know im probably the wrong person to interview
1444123 im a little not quite sure where to go but im happy by the open bar can i just ask though are they actually tattooing people here because thats retarded this is not the right environment for that
1444124 im here shooting interviews with musicians in the diesel booth what can i say about the experience there are a ton of sponsors here and plenty of free shit who doesnt love that also its just a chill vibe and everyones really nice in here
1444125 this is my first year in the music lounge and i love being here i just love working with loud music and tattooing ive tattooed a ton of musicians throughout my career so being here and offering free services isnt really about exposure to musicians im just here to do my job and make people happy
1444126 the energys really cool i like how there are different djs in different rooms it creates a bunch of distinct atmospheres
1444127 im here providing services with red 7 salon this is our second time working the lounge and were having a great time it gives the hairdressers a different atmosphere to work in and we get to meet people from all over the country as well as bands and members of the media acting as a sponsor is a unique opportunity for exposure
1444128 being part of the gifting suite is a great way to reach out to a bunch of artists at once while theyre here they can demo the product and give us feedback its great to be able to meet up with artists and interact with them
1444129 one thing i find confusing is the rock the vote banners at rock the vote nights i see the words up there but im not sure of the signficance since there are no polictical goings on in the lounge
1444130 i love the music the open bar and the people here are really cool but i feel like this is over sponsored theres brand exposure everywhere and in a way that makes this feel sort of corporate and more like a networking event than a real party
1444131 so church and state what does this have to do with a presidency
1444132 fifteen years ago today working families everywhere achieved a victory when the family and medical leave act went into effect this groundbreaking law helps guarantee that americas workers shouldnt have to choose between their jobs or their health and the health of their families
1444133 because of the fmla more than eighty million people have been able to take needed time off work to care for themselves or family members
1444134 and because millions of people a year who are covered by fmla cant afford to take the time to which theyre entitled ill assist states in adopting paid leave systems strengthening the family and medical leave act wont just benefit employers or workers it will help put the american dream within reach for hardworking families

1444137 theres a time for action and theres a time for vacation now is the time for action
1444138 ive gone to see anwr myself did you know that anwr is 20 million acres large of which 1 5 million was set aside for mineral exploration we are only proposing to drill on 2 000 acres which is 1 100th of 1 of the total size of anwr

1444141 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
1444142 were absolutely crazy not to use our own resources there is only one person who is stopping us from using americas resources speaker nancy pelosi all we are asking is to open the house its a simple request
1444143 it just doesnt make sense were a can do nation not a cant do nation were the nation of people that invented the light bulb we have the ability to solve this energy crisis
1444144 pelosi is on a book tour god bless her she wrote a book i wish i could take the time to write a book well now is the time to vote not the time to write a book
1444145 we cant pick and choose our alternative resources we must use them all because they support and compliment each other
1444146 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote today senator obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates

1444149 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1444150 we believe the congress should not take a five week paid vacation until it passes a compromise to give the american people access to more american energy
1444151 the american people arent going to get a vacation from high gas prices and congress shouldnt take a vacation until american families get relief at the pump
1444152 wouldnt you think it would be possible for your elected representatives to come together and formulate a plan to reduce gas prices
1444153 many people understand that any energy plan has to include deep ocean exploration
1444154 do not be discouraged we are here today to move forward on a compromise energy solution
1444155 for the past three weeks we have been pumping gas for my constituents i have heard from normal people saying that we need to use our natural resources we need to drill for oil we need to use wind we need to use solar we need to use geothermal energy
1444156 seventy six percent of the american people are saying get it done stop sending a 170 million a week check to hugo chavez
1444157 tras nueve a os de trayectoria hecho que no afect en demas a a los dem s componentes y que como si nada hubiera pasado han seguido adelante presentando este nuevo disco
1444158 we just want speaker pelosi to call members of congress back from their five week vacation for this vote if you think you are not being heard i want you to know you are i am holding a 1 500 page stack of emails you sent me yesterday keep emailing your congressmen
1444159 many people in my district use energy in their daily lives through farming and such when gas prices go up the standard of living in my district goes down
1444160 there are excuses like blame china and other countries but the truth is this problem of high energy prices lies right here at home no more excuses
1444161 it is important that we take these steps we need to take action today
1444162 the television cameras here are usually feed live to c span the lights are not usually dimmed like this why are they like this today because the democratic majority in this house of representatives decided to shut this place down and go on vacation
1444163 i know how much the auto industry and the autoworkers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so

1444165 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1444166 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1444167 this will not be easy and it will not happen overnight
1444168 talking about his plan to provide an immediate energy rebate to americans who are struggling with high gas prices create five million new green jobs and eliminate our need for middle eastern oil over the course of the next ten years
1444169 right now the obama campaign has at least 15 offices open in the state and they plan to open about a dozen more
1444170 obamas not saying i just need to get 271 electoral votes
1444171 im going to try to bring everybody and all these states on board cause we need to move this country together as a whole
1444172 go around put up signs shake some hands see some of the important people in the village
1444173 the campaign is treating alaska as a key battleground state
1444174 its a tough state to move but were making a play
1444175 if theres any year where a democrat can win alaska this is the year
1444176 weve always voted up here just nobodys paid much attention
1444177 i dont remember that there ever was a real democratic campaign in christian county or that a presidential candidate opened an office here
1444178 times are a changing which can be attributed to more people moving into the county and young people are more aware of whats going on
1444179 its not going to be an easy task but theyll know were here in christian county
1444180 weve never had this happen now we can come in and ask questions and talk
1444181 its a gathering place for democrats to be together weve never even been able to afford an office for our christian county democrats
1444182 the subcommittee has clearly recognized the importance of the inls mission to develop an advanced nuclear energy system for use across the nation and to develop the next generation of nuclear scientists and engineers the investment in inls advanced test reactor user facility and the center for advanced energy studies will provide vital support to crucial national programs like the next generation nuclear plant that will reduce our dependence on foreign fuel sources
1444183 essential to our food security and food safety and to preventing american agriculture from moving outside our borders
1444184 president bush and i have agreed on many issues but setting farm policy is not one of them
1444185 this bill is long overdue and its time for it to become law
1444186 specialty crops are about 51 percent of the gross revenue of american agriculture
1444187 but they have never been mentioned in our federal ag policy
1444188 off we go into the wild blue yonder climbing high into the sun
1444189 to capture the power of the sun from the blue yonder and transmit it back to the base electrical system
1444190 the most significant strategic challenge america faces is moving our nation and our nations defense to an energy independent posture
1444191 serves as a 21st century prototype not just for ohio but for the entire nation our region because of our advanced energy technologies will help lead america to a new day when energy freedom will be restored others may talk about restoring americas energy independence here in northern ohio we are already leading america forward
1444192 this base clearly captures that lead in a way that the public will come to understand
1444193 were creating the economy of the future thanks to a robust federal commitment combined with local participation from many quarters
1444194 theres a lot at stake here there is no higher priority than making our nation energy independent and positioning northern ohio as a leader in that endeavor we have shown that can lower our operating costs and improve our security at the same time we intend to show the rest of america the way to declaring independence from unstable foreign energy sources
1444195 she writes it in the mirror if the mirror smokes up
1444196 the parties dispute how many times shaffy was notified and how many times she had the dog out of its carrier
1444197 both the flight purser and captain lacey assert that they had no idea that shaffy was iranian or middle eastern prior to learning about this lawsuit
1444198 the reasonableness of the carriers opinion is to be tested on the information available to the airline at the moment a decision is required
1444199 before any of the problems arose during the flight captain lacey had overheard shaffy addressing the crews purser in a hostile and disrespectful manner as shaffy boarded the aircraft
1444200 once the aircraft was in the air and on the way to las vegas captain lacey received multiple calls from various members of the flight crew regarding shaffys recalcitrance
1444201 shaffy has presented no evidence on the number of calls captain lacey did or did not receive and is in no position to dispute that aspect of his testimony and declaration
1444202 moreover even if the crews complaints were exaggerated the captain had no choice but to rely on the information that the crew provided him
1444203 for the foregoing reasons set forth above the court grants uniteds motion for summary judgment
1444204 what we or at any rate what i refer to confidently as memory meaning a moment a scene a fact that has been subjected to a fixative and thereby rescued from oblivion is really a form of storytelling that goes on continually in the mind and often changes with the telling too many conflicting emotional interests are involved for life ever to be wholly acceptable and possibly it is the work of the storyteller to rearrange things so that they conform to this end in any case in talking about the past we lie with every breath we draw

1444225 everything that i know and everything i believe in basketball pretty much comes from coach chaney
1444226 when i talk to my staff the things that coach chaney says or used to say just flow out of me its not like i walk around trying to quote him but when you deal with a given situation you just hear his voice in mine
1444227 he and his staff have done a terrific job of getting the best out of each and every one of his guys and his team will be one to be reckoned with
1444228 i know some of his players almost as well as he does
1444229 our findings do not support the use of cocoa butter lotion for the prevention of striae gravidarum
1444230 we receive thousands of phone calls each year about cms at the american cancer society acs national cancer information center and our web pages on cm are among the most popular on our website
1444231 the very large number of randomly chosen volunteers in the acs studies of cancer survivors and the availability of personal medical and psychological information provided an opportunity to study this topic in very precise detail and in some new ways
1444232 one result we find especially interesting is the substantial differences in use of cms by gender and type of cancer
1444233 thus it is uncertain whether all study subjects had truly unexplained pain

1444238 the study has underlined the potential effect of the timing at exposure of sexual and body growth variables on the risk of prostate cancer
1444239 while it has not been immune to the negative macroeconomic trends it appears that a number of companies in it and it employment are outperforming the general economy this is in stark contrast to the last major economic pullback where it and it employment dramatically underperformed the broader economy and job market
1444240 for us to win the championship it was really the only way i could say thank you to him
1444241 its the only thing i can give him to show the appreciation for what hes done for me as a young head coach
1444242 it wasnt fair to the kids or the staff to try to completely change the way we play in three days
1444243 so we just went with what brought us there that game helped us for this season it gave our guys confidence in how we play
1444244 he was such a good shooter for us and a clutch shooter and he was one of our toughest players so well probably have to do it by committee to replace what he gave us
1444245 i thought they were the best team in the league pretty much all year
1444246 i was so impressed with their talent how hard they played and what a good job milan did coaching them
1444247 in a bigger picture coach phelan is not in the naismith basketball hall of fame
1444248 so anytime we can a chance to get on tv like that i feel good because i know its another opportunity for other people who may not know what hes done to put it in a bigger spotlight

1444296 the lowest common denominator in all of the missional incarnational practices is discipleship and the difficulty of discipling people in the midst of a consumerist culture the story of the middle class in america is one of safety security comfort and convenience in other words american christians have overwhelmingly chosen the story of the american way rather than the way of jesus

1444332 its not just teachers and school nurses who need to be able to deal with asthma
1444333 the office staff bus drivers and janitors also need to be informed sometimes especially in rural areas there is only one nurse who covers several schools its up to teachers and others to recognize impending symptoms and take appropriate actions
1444334 when we think of asthma we often think of severe wheezing and shortness of breath
1444335 however for many kids a full blown attack can be preceded by a persistent cough complaints of not feeling well and not behaving properly instead of the classic signs

1444338 importantly we discovered that this fibrosis occurs more rapidly and to a greater extent in the portion of the gut the largest lymphatic tissue in the body containing the t cells compared with other immune tissues

1444342 our method allows us to more efficiently find the beetles so that they can be controlled especially when their populations are low or when the beetles are difficult to survey
1444343 for invasive species it is much easier and cheaper to detect and try to eradicate invaders when they are still localized and their numbers are small before they have a chance to disperse widely
1444344 before our project little was known about the chemical ecology of cerambycid beetles or their use of attractant pheromones and the pheromones of only a few species had been identified
1444345 our longer term goals are to gain a better understanding of which subfamilies tribes and genera are likely to use pheromones and within those groups to determine the types of chemicals that are used as pheromones
1444346 conversely if we can predict which species do not use attractant pheromones there would be no point in looking for such compounds and we could focus on finding the chemicals that attract these species to their host trees
1444347 these morphological features and specific behaviors are reliably associated with pheromone use by cerambycid beetles
1444348 specifically for a large group of species we found males have a particular type of glandular structure to produce pheromones these males adopted a very specific stance when they were releasing their pheromones akin to doing pushups thus from simply checking for the presence of the glands or observing the behavior of a new invasive cerambycid species or both regulatory personnel can reliably predict whether a new species uses attractant pheromones that can be identified and exploited for its detection and management
1444349 this is critically important for lure design because lures must release 5 000 to 25 000 micrograms of pheromone per day to be effective
1444350 this is in marked contrast to pheromone baited traps for other insect species where release rates from the trap lures are typically a few micrograms per day we are working to develop lures for field use that are capable of these high release rates for extended periods such as weeks
1444351 packing high picture quality into a body thin enough to slide into a pocket that is the basic concept of micro four thirds

1444476 because of this oraquick test way more people accept hiv testing than otherwise might
1444477 but if in fact there are more false positives than anticipated we need to be prepared
1444478 if were going to start widely testing in a population where there hasnt been wide testing before were going to have to be really careful to have accurate and robust testing
1444479 there are now a number of companies that are getting close to introducing a new generation of rapid tests
1444480 an internist may be the ideal person to initiate the hiv testing encounter and handle any potential false positive results but many people under the current health care system dont have that kind of provider
1444481 if we screen people and dont get them into care weve done little to help the patients

1444498 clutch stats are over his career insanely consistent i didnt do the math to isolate his yankees tenure though
1444499 i have to say that my impression of a rod is that he is one of the mentally weakest superstar athletes i have ever watched he seems to often over swing for the fences rather than settle into the moment and rake he seems to fear failure more than be confident about success he seems to excel when not much is on the line or when someting happens so fast that he has to react on instinct rather than think about whats coming

1444523 review jamey johnsons new cd bare knuckled barroom poetry review
1444524 these quad machines are very noisy and cause the same noise pollution as motorbikes
1444525 in this instance though weve had many complaints from residents of the villages of mesoyi tala tremithusa emba kissonerga and chlorakas
1444526 we have a campaign to try to eliminate this problem
1444527 at least once a week police are in these areas trying to prevent illegal machines from driving on the road and to stop any offenders lawbreakers are charged and sent to court
1444528 since january we have had around ten such cases and the culprits paid fines ranging from 500 1 000 for various charges
1444529 obviously it would be better if these machines were only permitted for use off road but if they are properly registered the law allows them to be driven on the roads
1444530 we are always grateful for information received from the general public which helps us tackle this and other traffic offences
1444531 but these quad bikes are making life here a misery teenagers ride them and they seem to make continual rounds of the villages in the area
1444532 i think cyprus should ban these bikes from the roads and permit their use only for off road driving which im sure they are more suitable for
1444533 i moved to a village because i wanted some peace after living in the centre of paphos for years it seems as if no corner of paphos is quiet any more i know my neighbours feel as i do
1444534 i would like to know why the parents of these youngsters are allowing them to behave in this way
1444535 if it was my son or daughter i would teach them to respect other people its a sign of the times
1444536 so over the next year she is going to develop a research project around the themes that come from survivors

1444547 evidence of secret detention by the united states and whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown
1444548 he lord nazir said she is physically tortured and continuously raped by the officers at the prison
1444549 i call her the grey lady because she is almost a ghost a spectre whose cries and screams continues to haunt those who heard her this would never happen to a western woman
1444550 this is a very intelligent woman what is she doing outside of the governors residence the woman is a ph d is a woman like this really that stupid there is an incongruity and i have trouble accepting the governments claims
1444551 if she was carrying fluids and was considered dangerous then why was she left unattended in a room behind a curtain and this dangerous hardened criminal picks up a gun and misses
1444552 i fear a political prosecution to protect the united states from embarrassment rather than from terrorism

1444555 i think it is wrong to allow adoptions of children by gay and lesbian couples
1444556 i think lesbianism and homosexuality is morally wrong the law is supposed to discriminate sometimes in some respects it is supposed to discriminate against social order and anarchy
1444557 we wanted people to come in and have some fun and talk politics

1444562 i was very pleased with practice today the tempo was good the injuries i really dont have any updates id just like to thank everson walls for coming and being our guest the last couple days a cornerback from the cowboys browns and giants with 57 career interceptions he should be in the hall of fame in my opinion and he really just helped us out he went to the same high school that aqib talib went to and he was an undrafted free agent thats one of the reasons why im a little sensitive to the 80 man roster i think guys like everson walls might not be given an opportunity to make the team these days but he gave up his own kidney for ron springs id like to thank him for being here
1444563 we dont have a depth chart we might change it at lunch unfortunately we have to send in something theres a long way to go the depth chart right now is more for just paper people we dont know what to write in certain situations but weve got to write something well put it like that we have a long way to go to decide whos no 2 whos no 3 whos making it and whos not
1444564 a lot of people have seen him play and know why hes here too we have a lot invested too he started in 04 started in 05 started in 06 weve invested a lot in him we have a lot of confidence that he can come back and be a player hes getting some more turns and hes made a couple nice throws yesterday in the team period he missed a couple throws today but well keep working him in there and try to get him on the field against miami
1444565 we talked about it yesterday and the day before hes got flash playmaking ability hes also as i said theres too many lightning strikes around me we had a couple fumbled exchanges we had a forced ball turnover in red zone yesterday he threw an interception in the move the ball period the highs are high and the lows are low i just look for a little more consistent ride i dont like a bumpy ride but im really pleased with him the extended reps hes been given hes done a good job but i would not count brian griese out brian griese is doing some really good things as well
1444566 yeah which is good i thought our pass protection in certain situations was good we had a couple good rushes that came clean but for the most part we threw the ball we had a couple key drops one down the field and one on a key third and 12 you cant drop the ball but most things considered we were pleased with today
1444567 yeah its just as big as a dropped pass we need to get more turnovers we won a championship a few years ago because we generate turnovers and we score touchdowns when we get the ball on defense our linebackers are dropping too many interceptions weve dropped i think five now in this camp so weve got something to work on in our individuals today
1444568 thats why i collect these quarterbacks you know i do a good job of that ive got five totally different breeds of quarterback that no one else in football has what i have here i feel good about that
1444569 well they should its third and 12 the nfl conversion rate is less than 10 percent in that situation a lot of those conversions are garbage yards at the end of the game we should dominate that situation third down and 12 we dropped a slant that would have been a first down i thought luke mccown scrambled for a first down against a two deep man under coverage so there were some good spots certainly but we should dominate that drill
1444570 im just looking forward to getting in a game situation just getting on the airplane and playing a team like miami seeing a different front we need to do that its part of the education process these preseason games a lot of the players that experience not only the live game situations but a different front to block a different route to see those types of things well see how our players react were going to look at a lot of guys
1444571 hes coming back to health and he ran a couple down the field routes where we didnt throw him the ball because our quarterbacks i think didnt realize he was 100 percent back but he was blazing down the field we missed a couple wide open looks today in the team pass segment but its great to see him back out here and hes going to give us some juice certainly he and joey galloway will give us two guys that can run like heck
1444572 i would like to rate my hands to be one of the best hands on the team i always tell all of the players that when it comes to plays like that i like to make those plays sometimes i cant but i will keep working on it
1444573 i am just playing i am just playing football and i think i am just playing i dont know how good of a camp i am really having i know i am breaking some balls up but i am just playing the game of football that i love what defensive coordinator monte kiffin tells me and what raheem tells me i am still learning and ronde is still teaching me so i am learning from him i am also learning from other players in certain things that they do i am enjoying myself to the best of my ability and i am playing the game of football something i love i am just going to keep on working hard and keep pushing myself
1444574 just work on timing and just trying to make the right fits and just trying to get back into the game process and everything i am just taking it step by step i am going to go out there and just build off of some of the things i did last year and then try to fix some things so i will be ready before the opening game at the new orleans saints
1444575 i would say a better environment i never figured myself to have a problem with tackling anyway i think the situation that i was put in it was down a lot of losing a lot of stuff going on behind closed doors that people dont really know about it it was kind of depressing at the same time i just came here with the mindset of me just coming out here playing it is just the environment they respect you they make you feel like a man and at certain places they never really make you feel that way they have a great deal of respect here and that is one thing that i love about playing in tampa
1444576 being here we take pride in our tackling when you watch ronde and derrick brooks and all these other veteran players they lead by example so if you dont fall in line you are going to be left behind it is real simple to just fall in line i like the way that they approach practice the way they approach the game they study and they are just on top of things they are never perfect you can never be perfect but you can try to be perfect and that is rondes and derrick brooks motto
1444577 you can always improve every year because we were number two so we want to be number one so we can improve in that area if we can improve on making more impact plays to help our offense to give our offense some more yards and put them in a better situation because tampas defense prides itself on getting turnovers and scoring with them so that was always the whole implication once i first got here so if we can emphasize more on that and being more physical stripping the balls and trying to get the ball back and scoring with it not just turning the ball over but scoring with it that is more of the improvement that i see that we can make a big improvement on as far as that just having fun and everybody just showing effort and hustling
1444578 when i look at this group i just see so many possibilities with it and i think thats the main reason coach jon gruden decided to go this way we have a lot of guys that can do a lot of different things and i think it just makes us a much more dangerous offense when you have those weapons at your disposal
1444579 in years past weve had guys that can do one specific thing and youre either a blocking tight end or youre a receiving tight end i think with the group we have now we have guys that can do a little bit of everything therefore teams dont really know what to key on i think it helps us more than anything
1444580 its always been like that since ive been here gruden definitely likes to use his tight ends when you have three tight ends that are able to do so much youre able to split guys out you can have guys in the backfield it just creates mismatches for defenses and gruden loves to do that so we just try to make it available to him
1444581 im excited about it honestly from top to bottom jeffs garcia had a year to be under this offense our offensive line has had a year to come together im excited about jeff faine so just all around the board i think we have so many weapons that weve been on the brink of utilizing but havent utilized to our fullest potential when you look at guys like maurice stovall michael clayton finally being healthy again joey galloways still going to do his thing and ike hilliard so from top to bottom im really excited about what we have to offer
1444582 gruden always makes that point that he likes people overlooking us nobody picked us to be nfc south champions last year either just to have those preseason recognitions if it meant something youd get a ring right now as long as they are going to crown the nfc south champions whoevers going to be in the super bowl were fine with that we know what our goal is and we think well be there at the end of the year

1444614 dia pesepakbola sangat berbakat namun saya katakan dia masih muda dan memasukannya dia lebih dalam itu adalah mengambil langkah besar tapi manajer sudah biasa menangani situasi ini lebih dulu sepanjang karirnya

1444634 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1444635 this plan will not lower prices today it will not lower prices during the next administration the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least the next seven years

1444740 todays not even an audition theyre bringing me in today just to sit me down and talk how about that its even better than an audition
1444741 quien ha visto la locura sabe que del terror lo unico insoportable es el silencio
1444742 i keep hearing it repeated more recently by the association of teachers and lecturers atl the rsa and the key stage 3 curriculum review that what we should be doing in schools is only teaching children when they are developmentally ready that they should not be stretched pushed or tested or taught teacher to pupil in a didactic way that the purpose of education is acquiring these life skills and not a body of knowledge
1444743 as a consequence of acquisition of knowledge young people will learn how to think you cannot teach a generic skill of teaching and learning
1444744 every child apart from those with specific educational needs should be able to obtain a grade c at gcse in maths
1444745 project based and theme based learning simply does not work
1444746 in part of the national strategy for science students are meant to draw a chalk line on the floor and the children are asked to stand on it where their views conform with the line
1444747 the curriculum asks the children in a secondary school class to stand on the line to reflect where they stand in that debate this is not fundamental science teaching and it does not impart any knowledge about science to those children it is simply a current affairs discussion
1444748 we square this circle by saying that we want to sweep away a lot of the prescription which does come from government
1444749 there are 59 pages about sitting and concentrating on other pedagogical issues that should be left to professional discretion in the national literacy strategy and primary strategy
1444750 primary education should be devoted for the most part to ensuring that children leave ready for secondary education with the core skills secondary education should be built around a two path system with academic and vocational training available after the first two years
1444751 the final year of school should be part spent in college
1444752 as a consequence of acquisition of knowledge young people will learn how to think
1444753 our children are literally becoming jacks of all trades and masters of none
1444754 wow shes going to be so beautiful and cute they all mixed kids are all like that

1444758 i just dont see how anybody fighting against racism can give in to accepting even the language of racism

1444769 high school is actually really important its about formulating an identity getting a path and sticking to it a lot of the ghosts in your head that are critical can come from your high school years
1444770 i narrowed it down to three states and called hundreds of schools from that group i got 10 schools to agree i went to visit all those high schools and interviewed the incoming senior classes that were interested
1444771 i focused on the midwest because theres an innocence and timelessness about this part of the country i wanted it to be in a town that only had one high school and wasnt next to a big city because there would be more social pressure that way
1444772 from the feedback ive received my being open paid off for the audience in a way i learned i was stronger than i gave myself credit for i was able to be open and honest with strangers the filmmakers while knowing no one but being able to express everything
1444773 the first couple months was about getting the participants used to being filmed
1444774 the more popular kids took longer to let me in and trust me then when i got everyone comfortable there could be three cameras going at once
1444775 when we were filming we were just hanging out with director nanette burstein and it didnt seem like a big deal
1444776 it is more difficult to watch myself on the big screen while reliving mistakes over and over and over again
1444777 the core issues in high school havent changed from then to now i was feeling the same things doing this documentary that i felt in high school about wanting to fit in the feelings of manipulation and the rumors from everyone
1444778 my parents were very satisfied and especially with the way it came out about my sister
1444779 while there were some shockers about what was happening behind closed doors the two year buffer from filming to release helped a bit there
1444780 but the filmmakers were surprised how well my dad could move as an elvis impersonator
1444781 technology has brought some change mobile phones text messages e mail and ichat all cause regrettable behavior because at that age theres no perspective on short or long term consequences
1444782 cruelty is also amped up and cyber bullying is off the charts overall that makes high school more challenging
1444783 your peers very much want you to act one way and if you want to fit in you might have to sublimate who you are for me the theme was about identity
1444784 it is very hard to figure out who you are at that age but you are starting to and its the first time in your life you are starting to figure out who you are

1444824 the town says route 1 is a state road but we agreed to maintain it when we asked the state to put in granite curbing and a sidewalk connecting downtown to camden hills state park
1444825 we paid so much for that granite curbing and it looks terrible out there
1444826 it was supposed to be low or no maintenance up there and its too narrow for us to cut without disrupting traffic
1444827 it is on our annual cutting schedule though and we did it in june

1444835 it was interesting that both sahms and working moms feel judged by the other and they both feel like failures
1444836 i think that is the truest statement everyone is judging everyone because everyone feels there is no exact right way to be doing things

1444864 caraclark anna is not fat by any means and i think its very ridiculous for you to say so considering shes less than the national average even none of these women are even remotely obese by any means you and your husband probably deserve each other
1444865 im overall offended by the title of this article and i dont consider myself to be a feminist however youre saying brits like em big means that a size 10 is big when the average is a 12 can we really consider that big then and as someone in a size 12 at 59

1444883 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1444884 we welcome any new research that could lead to the development of effective treatments for psychosis especially if those treatments bring fewer of the horrible side effects that are associated with some medications for schizophrenia
1444885 these findings are exciting but we cant jump the gun this is one small study and it needs to be followed up with further research before any of us can be really excited about it
1444886 its clear from research weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is a concern about their health but they want clear information which is non stigmatizing and helpful research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight
1444887 this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1444888 nine out of ten parents of overweight children think their child is a healthy weight we have chosen not to use the word obese there is no point giving parents a letter that doesnt have any impact
1444889 we have gone past the stage of being nice we have got to bring people up short and tell parents your child is obese do something about it or it will die before you do

1444912 is easily identified there was a conflict between the interests of the men who ran the business and the interests of the people who worked for them as long as the directors could escape with their huge pay packets they had little incentive to ensure that their employees escaped with anything at all
1444913 in companies in which the principal shareholders and the executives are different people problems like this should not occur the shareholders will reward the managers for looking after their capital in a responsible fashion but in truth because of the opportunity costs of capital shareholders and executives have a common interest in securing jam today rather than jam tomorrow the owners reward the executives for profit rather than investment so the managers sacrifice the future to the present its arguable that the staggering returns the high street banks made this year should not have been treated as profits at all but as the money which might have protected them and us against bad loans when the next recession arrives
1444914 the money which would have been snaffled by the executives has instead been re invested
1444915 for a country widely credited with inventing the idea the united kingdom is remarkably hostile to workers co operatives in one form or another they have existed since the division of labour began but it was our own enlightened capitalist robert owen who formalised the idea the workers communities he founded in the early 19th century soon collapsed we still have one very large workers co op the john lewis partnership and hundreds or if you count professional partnerships thousands of smaller ones but the manufacturing co ops owen envisaged are few and tiny the reason we are always told is that they are simply not as competitive as hierarchical capitalism given that there is no law against forming them why if they are such a good idea have they not outcompeted the standard business model
1444916 there is i think an interesting answer to this question
1444917 in several other countries workers co ops in which all the workers have a stake in the business and a voice in its decision making processes have flourished
1444918 the greater the capital investment he shows the greater the potential inefficiency which could explain the scarcity of manufacturing co ops co ops in other words like hierarchical firms suffer from conflicts of interest there are other constraints too the lack of access to capital keeping the business in the hands of the workers means keeping absentee owners and their money out and the lack of opportunities for capital you cant move it around as freely as other shareholders can the mondragon co op appears to have overcome both these problems by establishing its own bank which circulates money among its 200 affiliated businesses and by encouraging diversification

1444946 i feel it is a right of women to be able to give birth safely and when a woman is hiv positive the baby can obviously have the virus transmitted before being born

1444949 the main theme is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1444950 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1444951 for us people are people you should all have your own opinion we are hopefully putting the human element in what is an unfortunate part of life there are people over there dealing with situations like this and were showing the human part of being there

1444979 ralph is running and these are what were running for
1444980 oh yeah im tired of the i cant believe that barack has fled so far to the right
1444981 well thats where he started out i dont think theres been any real change in him
1444982 morgan is doing well after his surgery last night to reconnect nerves and repair damage in his left arm and hand
1444983 the surgery last night lasted four and a half hours hes visiting with family this morning as of this morning hes up and walking around and looking forward to his release in a few days
1444984 well if you promise to patronize our sponsors you have permission to go walk the dog now
1444985 but something else surprised me how much you can love an adopted child the same as you can love a biological child i didnt anticipate that
1444986 the other day the guy guard tripped and fell with his gun on him it could have gone off and had fatal consequences it is inconceivable that tom hanks who claims to be the voice of the little people could tolerate this
1444987 we want to be really plain about what our issues are with the movie
1444988 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
1444989 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
1444990 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine
1444991 the gospel portrait implies that jesus would be found guilty by the self conscious religious majority of any age and background
1444992 it seemed ironic to me because i thought the fake boot camp was nothing like a real boot camp
1444993 its about 10 times harder you guys from experience i can tell you firsthand
1444994 the idea for this movie is what happens when a bunch of actors get stuck out in the jungle in a real world situation because us actors most of us are what wussies
1444995 pick a note everyone and just go with it why dont you
1444996 lord i need that little woman like the crops need the rain
1444997 lord i need that little woman like the broncs need a rein
1444998 are more prone to practice public service through volunteer work than political office
1444999 morgan you just dont even sweat it you get better were thinking of you were waiting for you baby
1445000 photographers moved into apartments next door to us and we really found ourselves kind of living like a spy movie i feel like they think they have to be there like they punch in or something
1445001 the time that is effectively used to send or receive the data expressed as a percentage of total period of time
1445002 citizens inquiry into the forensic use of dna and the national dna database ndad
1445003 need for a nationwide public awareness campaign about the ndnad that will reach all sections of the population
1445004 should be an independent body with broad membership constituted by statue specifically to oversee the ndnad
1445005 that there should be harmonisation between approaches in scotland and england and wales and that the scottish approach should be favoured
1445006 any such scheme would require the fullest public debate to establish whether whatever the benefits it amounted to excessive surveillance as a step too far for the british way of life
1445007 home movies allow us to revisit the past through film
1445008 anyone who has a fondness for home movies is encouraged to attend this celebration of the art and craft of home movie making
1445009 home movies are like snapshots the dna of our collective memory the first inkling of history

1445022 he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears or sees and he will tell you what is yet to come
1445023 if 3 000 miles is a fair amount for mileage from a chain thats only been used on the road cannondale bikes are worthless excrement ive gotten better bikes from a dumpster to repair the damage that theyve done to that bike would cost twice as much as the bike pure foolishness is what you are talking and supporting consider that the bike company that replaces cannondale may be who i have to rely on to get a new bike

1445033 the one chasing after what is bad is in line for his own death
1445034 my word will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it
1445035 an onward sweeping tempest that will not turn back until he will have carried out the ideas of his heart
1445036 you must certainly put him to death your hand must be the first in putting him to death
1445037 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
1445038 arise o lord deliver me o my god strike all my enemies on the jaw break the teeth of the wicked from the lord comes deliverance may your blessings be on your people
1445039 come on we have to go get jimmy to take credit for this
1445040 bob packers kid did this he said that he was going to fix it may bob packer rest in peace
1445041 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house
1445042 que pasa sounds like a conspiracy to prove that japan is producing explosive gas tanks

1445053 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1445054 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1445055 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1445056 its like a fog has lifted shes present and showing responsibility for herself again

1445059 immigration policy should be a realistic reflection of our society
1445060 too much regulation hurts our economy by limiting the pool of cheap labor and creates incentives to enter the country illegally too little leaves the united states open to harm immigration reform should balance the needs of our economy with the need for domestic security
1445061 huge problem in the united states that will only worsen if we continue to play games instead of getting serious about real reform
1445062 my soul proclaims the greatness of the lord my spirit rejoices in god my saviour he has looked with favour on his lowly servant
1445063 a treasure of inestimable value greater even than that of any other art
1445064 w e will have a huge international project next to our borders and well have to correspond to international standards if we want to benefit from the winter olympics we have to start working right now
1445065 i consider that that question will be resolved the same way as with the railroad
1445066 i would not say that all our economy is being built on the fact that we should receive a certain role at sochi
1445067 no its one of the possible options for taking revenue into the republics budget but that doesnt mean that its one of the most important or one of the most fundamental options
1445068 a considerable number of people to visit our cultural sites
1445069 its going to take more than an explosion to keep us away
1445070 the situation in abkhazia has changed since the sochi announcement
1445071 tourism is better than oil and we are very lucky
1445072 opponent democrat bill s day jr has a wealth of experience as a harvard mba a developer and currently a mental health counselor that would make him a much more promising lawmaker
1445073 the stakes in this election are bigger than any one person and voters in our district deserve to have a democratic candidate on the ballot this november who can overcome the politics of personal attack
1445074 through the work in this show visitors will see how womens roles in society have changed
1445075 my favorite items in this exhibition are the portraits that family members painted of each other
1445076 it is interesting to see how the women interpreted their relatives through art
1445077 with a little more luck i might have been able to ask you to be my vice president
1445078 after that first game i knew i had to keep my head up and keep playing
1445079 in order to get to where i want to be ultimately i know i have to keep putting in the hard work
1445080 it was a great experience especially being new to pro ball
1445081 its a historic place and to have the huge crowd that we did for that game its something ill never forget
1445082 the other night seriously he talked to me for 25 minutes about how to make pork ribs in your backyard
1445083 everything that i know and everything i believe in basketball pretty much comes from coach chaney
1445084 when i talk to my staff the things that coach chaney says or used to say just flow out of me its not like i walk around trying to quote him but when you deal with a given situation you just hear his voice in mine
1445085 he and his staff have done a terrific job of getting the best out of each and every one of his guys and his team will be one to be reckoned with
1445086 i know some of his players almost as well as he does
1445087 we received the sukhoi aircraft as well as pilots crew and missiles and the aircraft will begin military practice with missiles soon
1445088 hey salty check out my new business idea my dads going to help me out with it i have first rights on a four bedroom trailer in a park right next to campus ill be living there so i can regulate and make sure everythings under control think about the returns i can make on such a cheap investment what you say
1445089 are you kidding me you are going to live as the landlord aka enemy with two to three unknown persons of the type that would be interested in renting a single room in a trailer youd cringe every time they dropped a spaghetti fork have you seen trailer parks anyway you say youre a deep sleeper now but what about when the cops come around at 4 in the morning because someone is pulling out someone elses weave who would live there
1445090 n o faltou nada em nossa prepara o agora chegou a hora da verdade
1445091 estamos motivadas e trabalhamos muito para chegar at aqui o brasil est numa chave dif cil mas temos consci ncia de que em jogos ol mpicos n o existe jogo f cil e acredito muito na for a deste grupo
1445092 todos os atletas sonham em participar dos jogos ol mpicos e a nossa expectativa de um resultado melhor do que em atenas 04
1445093 ap s quatro games eu j n o conseguia mais sacar
1445094 estou jogando bem mas ainda n o confio no meu f sico duro pois entro em quadra e n o sei quanto o meu condicionamento vai durar
1445095 uma contratura que veio depois do jogo duro que fiz com o ricardinho na semana passada
1445096 bem legal disputar os jogos ol mpicos pela ltima vez justamente aqui na terra do t nis
1445097 o mais engra ado que v rias vezes os chineses me confundem acham que eu nasci aqui e come am a falar na l ngua deles a eu tento explicar que n o sei falar mandarim
1445098 foi um momento nico que vai ficar pra sempre na minha mem ria um jogo em que nem o torcedor mais fan tico acreditava que poder amos vencer s n s e felizmente conseguimos
1445099 lembro de uma vez que enfrentei eles pelo atl tico paranaense terminamos o primeiro tempo vencendo por dois a zero e tomamos a virada no segundo eles s o muito fortes aqui
1445100 foi um momento nico que vai ficar pra sempre na minha mem ria um jogo em que nem o torcedor mais fan tico acreditava que poder amos vencer s n s e felizmente conseguimos
1445101 lembro de uma vez que enfrentei eles pelo atl tico paranaense terminamos o primeiro tempo vencendo por dois a zero e tomamos a virada no segundo eles s o muito fortes aqui
1445102 chego com muito otimismo o nosso momento n o bom no campeonato mas juntos vamos trabalhar para tirar o fluminense dessa situa o
1445103 meu av fluminense roxo ele se chama jos alves e tem 67 anos antes de vir para o rio passei na casa dele em s o jos dos campos e fui recebido por ele vestido com a camisa tricolor ele me desejou boa sorte e disse que torcer muito por mim
1445104 eu estava conversando com o andrade auxiliar t cnico e lembrando que essa n o foi a primeira nem a ltima vez que passamos por um momento de dificuldade e com uni o que vamos superar esse momento dif cil
1445105 o elenco bom e tem condi es de dar a volta por cima temos que rezar e pedir prote o de s o judas tadeu porque ele sempre esteve ao nosso lado
1445106 inconformado com os lament veis epis dios envolvendo a arbitragem
1445107 simplesmente tr s dos quatro gols sofridos pelo vasco da gama foram assinalados em franca irregularidade
1445108 as imagens da partida revelam que os dois primeiros gols do advers rio ocorreram na posi o de impedimento
1445109 ademais registre se que a jogada que originou a marca o de p nalti a favor da equipe da casa teve in cio com uma infra o cometida sobre um jogador do vasco da gama fato que tamb m passou despercebido pela arbitragem
1445110 consta no s tio dessa entidade na internet a resolu o da presid ncia da cbf rdp n 02 2005 que disp e sobre os per odos de inscri o e registro de jogadores profissionais transferidos para o brasil a qual fixa o segundo per odo de registro de atletas no prazo compreendido entre 3 e 31 de agosto de cada ano
1445111 entretanto para surpresa do consulente vasco da gama o s o paulo registrou o atleta antes do referido prazo utilizando se do jogador antes do in cio do per odo de inscri o fixado pela pr pria cbf
1445112 daddy im a porn star now when sky cherry told our resident
1445113 for us to win the championship it was really the only way i could say thank you to him
1445114 its the only thing i can give him to show the appreciation for what hes done for me as a young head coach
1445115 it wasnt fair to the kids or the staff to try to completely change the way we play in three days
1445116 so we just went with what brought us there that game helped us for this season it gave our guys confidence in how we play
1445117 he was such a good shooter for us and a clutch shooter and he was one of our toughest players so well probably have to do it by committee to replace what he gave us
1445118 i thought they were the best team in the league pretty much all year
1445119 i was so impressed with their talent how hard they played and what a good job milan did coaching them
1445120 in a bigger picture coach phelan is not in the naismith basketball hall of fame
1445121 so anytime we can a chance to get on tv like that i feel good because i know its another opportunity for other people who may not know what hes done to put it in a bigger spotlight
1445122 la renovaci n del acuerdo fortalece la relaci n de 20 a os que tenemos que lion nathan y consideramos que corona continuar creciendo en este importante mercado

1445124 hago un llamado en rgico tambi n para que nos pongamos de acuerdo y que dediquemos nuestra actividad p blica y los recursos de la gente no para actividades pol ticas que dividen a los ciudadanos sino los problemas que verdaderamente afectan a la gente como es el caso de seguridad p blica
1445125 si estuvi ramos m s unidos el gobierno federal y los gobiernos estatales y en este caso el gobierno del df seguramente ya hubi ramos avanzado mucho m s en el camino para mejorar la calidad de la polic a particularmente la de aqu lla entidad
1445126 me parece que el aspecto que funda un aumento tarifario es la justificaci n econ mica al no haber ahorita ning n movimiento en el mbito de lo econ mico que pueda justificar lo m s seguro es que no haya ning n ajuste
1445127 est n en su derecho de pedir a la autoridad le corresponde la revisi n yo creo que no hay elementos en estos momentos para otra alza
1445128 no nos deben espantar es simplemente un ajuste natural de ofertas y demandas

1445130 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
1445131 when i first presented my early atom probe research at microscopy and microanalysis in 2000 there were five other atom probe presentations now m amp m has full day and afternoon sessions dedicated to atom probe research
1445132 its a very exciting time to be in this field especially when you have a fully equipped facility like the central analytical facility to assist in the development of new techniques and applications
1445133 but we realised there were no stars in it so that it must be a cloud of gas
1445134 we now think that what were looking at is light from a quasar the bright stormy centre of a distant galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole
1445135 the quasar itself is no longer visible to us but its light continues to travel through space and the voorwerp is a massive light echo produced as this light strikes the gas
1445136 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1445137 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise
1445138 trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1445139 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have done before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1445140 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1445141 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1445142 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1445143 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1445144 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1445145 when we got the news about hannys voorwerp we were intrigued to find out what it was and fortunately we were able to slew the telescopes round and get some great images and spectra to study it
1445146 it was only later that we heard the story about how it had been discovered its inspirational that hanny picked out this object from galaxy zoo in her spare time and nobody had ever seen anything like it before
1445147 good evening were radiohead if youre here for kid rock youve come to the wrong place
1445148 eu estou me sentindo muito bem j nadei com esses advers rios em outras oportunidades disputei a prova com eles em melbourne austr lia e neste ano um encontro completamente diferente estamos em uma competi o maior e h mais press o
1445149 o calor n o nos assusta at gosto desse clima acho at que uma vantagem para as duplas brasileiras estamos acostumadas a jogar em qualquer temperatura em locais mais frios as europ ias levam vantagem mas aqui bom para gente
1445150 em jogos ol mpicos n o tem cansa o nem dificuldades s supera o o calor vira algo psicol gico vamos entrar em quadra para nos divertir mas sem perder o foco que alcan ar o melhor resultado
1445151 fernando busca o que coloquialmente se conhece como um jogador bom bonito e barato para injetar uma dose de compet ncia em timo hildebrand e o goleiro brasileiro se encaixa nos par metros indicados
1445152 con 1 87m de altura e 82 quilos de peso renan o goleiro do futuro no brasil e est pronto para fazer as malas para a europa h apenas duas semanas o jogador esteve pr ximo de acertar com o sporting lisboa mas as negocia es n o deram frutos as circunst ncias por m podem ser proveitosas para traz lo ao est dio mestalla
1445153 temos que trazer o treinador um t cnico para ficar mais tempo no clube pois n o adianta trazer um s para dar satisfa o para a torcida
1445154 tem que ter calma tranq ilidade e consci ncia para as coisas se acertarem com o novo t cnico e o atl tico seguir em seu caminho
1445155 estamos um pouco frustrados mas sabemos que n o somos um time imbat vel por m o brasil nos ltimos anos conquistou o respeito internacional por ter vencido mais do que perdido quem resiste a sete anos de press o e chega ao lugar mais alto do p dio ol mpico n o pode ser chamado de time que n o suporta press o
1445156 descuidamos do bloqueio um fundamento que os russos tamb m falharam bastante mas erraram menos que a gente apesar da derrota o brasil ainda tem o respeito dos outros times agora hora de focar fechar essa p gina e abrir uma nova vamos jogar mordidos com raiva mesmo
1445157 j vivemos situa es de derrota em outras oportunidades e sempre superamos as dificuldades temos experi ncia nesse tipo de situa o
1445158 estou muito feliz de estar em pequim pois participar dos jogos ol mpicos a realiza o de qualquer atleta a torcida pode continuar acreditando em nosso time porque vamos jogar tudo o que sabemos na luta pela medalha de ouro
1445159 uma pena o sonho acabar assim participar das olimp adas um resumo de toda a minha vida at aqui mas sei que terei uma segunda olimp ada para participar
1445160 a rea o dela foi muito bonita de se preocupar com as outras cinco
1445161 eu disse s outras meninas que tudo o que erika queria era uma chance de entrar no tatame e lutar em pequim e ela n o vai ter ent o que todas aproveitem essa chance que ter o e d em o m ximo se estamos passando por mais essa dificuldade por algum motivo vamos superar a tristeza eu continuo acreditando muito num belo resultado do jud feminino do brasil
1445162 uma les o s ria com necessidade de cirurgia para recupera o plena ela deve voltar a treinar entre quatro e seis meses nas pr ximas tr s semanas ela ainda far fisioterapia e ser reavaliada
1445163 a erika foi a primeira judoca do brasil a se classificar para pequim j que foi prata no pan e quinta no mundial para n s da comiss o t cnica um sofrimento grande dar essa not cia mas tomamos a decis o para preservar a integridade f sica dela e n o prejudicar a continuidade de sua carreira
1445164 all we did was learn about star wars and play a game with a robot and i didnt like the pizza
1445165 we didnt even get to do any light saber battles
1445166 i dont know why with all those jedi masters there they didnt just use the force to open the door
1445167 acordei s 6 horas 17 horas de segunda no brasil mas ainda n o estou adaptado ao fuso hor rio
1445168 acho que em dois dias j estarei adaptado na quarta feira inclusive devo treinar com uma intensidade maior
1445169 eu n o sei se vou nadar todas as provas provavelmente participarei das duas do medley 200m e 400m e dos revezamentos n o sei se vou participar dos 200m costas
1445170 trata se das olimp adas ent o eu quero tirar o m ximo proveito dessa chance para ter um bom resultado
1445171 o meu objetivo nadar o mais r pido que posso esquecer as finais esquecer tudo eu quero sair da gua feliz e saber que fiz o meu melhor
1445172 bonita fant stica muito melhor que a de atenas todas as coisas est o melhores e mais f ceis tenho f cil acesso a tudo que preciso
1445173 so i sound less like a character in a guy ritchie movie
1445174 this altformat story competition has clearly allowed the childrens writing skills to flourish safe in the comfort of their spelling and grammar are not being judged id have quite liked to have had that opportunity available to me whilst i was at school
1445175 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season
1445176 he has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union i cant see him going back to league that seems to be a closed chapter in his career
1445177 what we are keen to do if we can is ensure that no such contract is entered into
1445178 we have come to the court as soon as we could in order to protect the rights of the bulldogs
1445179 it is difficult to quantify what loss will be suffered
1445180 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no

1445194 t o the extent that a surtax on the corporate income of crude oil producers on their upstream operations could approximate such a pure corporate profits tax this would not raise crude oil prices and would not increase petroleum imports in the short run while the current corporate income tax is not a pure corporate profits tax a surtax for oil companies would arguably be an administratively simple and economically effective way to capture estimated oil windfalls in the short run

1445204 theres one obvious area where the bad news isnt all out yet and thats with home prices home prices are going to fall much more than people expect
1445205 i think its going to be well worse than 33 percent and heres why if you look at the futures market its indicating a range right around between 2002 2003 levels when home ownership rates were actually higher but fewer people can qualify for a mortgage because youve got to put 20 percent down and thats a lot of money for people
1445206 furthermore then youve got to find a bank to lend to you because countrywides not lending to you

1445229 when they bought the system of course it wasnt defined for a setup like a community clinic
1445230 so there was a lot of additional costs like programming
1445231 we deal with a lot of changes here with state federal and even county regulations so in order to keep up we needed something that could provide a faster turnaround to meet those changes
1445232 i explained to him what open source software was that the codes are free theyre easy to modify and things like that and he actually bought into it he was really surprised to hear about it and so he asked me is there an open source solution for healthcare administration so around 2003 i researched the idea
1445233 but we got grants for different projects like chronic disease management and we were often allowed to incorporate overhead costs into those budgets so we would use those extra monies to develop the clearhealth system
1445234 operation samahan is particularly important to clearhealth because its an fqhc
1445235 they are representative of organizations with fewer resources that are generally on the front lines of the chronic disease crisis in this country their frugality is a good driver of efficiencies and innovations that have impacted the clearhealth system the proprietary systems out there typically focus on features to sell the software and keep organizations from being able to move or interoperate to support their lock in models working with samahan naturally led us to a model that builds features based on tangible benefits in real settings rather than just eye candy in a sales brochure
1445236 as the beta testers whatever clearhealth developed with other clinics was incorporated into our system as well the whole development project cost about 200 000 in total and we didnt have to contribute a penny were getting all these enhancements for free and as part of the deal i helped them start up certain features
1445237 we were able to cope with all the standard changes in billing really easily
1445238 in the meantime we had all these complaints from other clinics who were saying oh my gosh we havent gotten paid in six months because our software vendors are very slow in keeping up with these changes we were so glad that we got out of that system
1445239 were already in the thick of developing the emr side into our system you cant find any system right now at this cost that can give you full emr capability as well as pms so what will happen with these clinics that have only pms on proprietary software is that theyll have to ditch whatever they have now and move to a new system so its more expensive
1445240 were actually in the process of establishing a separate entity of operation samahan that will offer technical services to other clinics
1445241 in fact were already supporting another clinic thats twice our size for their technical needs with my knowledge of megawest i can help them but theyre on the verge of changing their system and theyre looking very hard at their options are they going to a proprietary system that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars we can help them compare the system we have and with all these features to a proprietary system thats five times the cost just to acquire it
1445242 were getting a one week turnaround with our claims now with megawest we would see a two to three week turnaround community clinics dont have that big reserve and one week of delayed payments can cripple your company because thats your bottom line
1445243 at some point the staff were reluctant but then they saw the system
1445244 megawest is actually text based so its all command line driven so i had older staff members who werent very familiar with the mouse and they were saying well i dont know how to use this because its all a graphical interface its not so much open source or proprietary because they dont really know the difference they just see whats on the screen when i showed them clearhealth which is web based the younger staff got it it was zero training for them because theyre very familiar with the internet with the older staff it was just a matter of getting used to the mouse

1445254 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1445255 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
1445256 there may have been people who said this is going to be harder than you think this is going to take a long time but nobody said what we should do is collect a lot of money and let it sit there

1445259 there was tremendous hurt in the team after the loss and it started with anil kumble
1445260 he is a fantastic leader and fighter he has a tremendous work ethic and takes test cricket very seriously
1445261 it all started with kumble when they lost the first test and from there it filtered down to the rest of the team and so to be honest with you to motivate the team to improve their performance by 20 percent wasnt really difficult i can sense that the team is ready to make history
1445262 he is a quality seamer at the moment he stands out in the indian set up
1445263 he is probably our best seamer at the moment there are always going to be little issues that he has to handle he is a young bowler and hes learning how to go about bowling in test cricket he is learning which are good areas to bowl we do a strategy session where we talk about each opposition batsman but sometimes for a young pacer all this can get quite confusing so at the end of the day we tell him to bowl his natural length when he is bowling his natural length he is as good as anyone in the world
1445264 every player bats differently the success of any test side is how each batsmen sticks to his own skill and works on one or two things that he can improve in his game
1445265 we certainly dont say sehwag plays like this so the rest of the batsmen need to play like this
1445266 what we can do is ask rahul what his plans are and see that he goes out to bat with a positive mind frame and do what he plans to do if sehwag gets 100 it is going to look very different to when dravid gets 100 thats the make up of any test side
1445267 he can come and take over the reins we had an extensive chat yesterday there is calm focus about the team and there is a humility about how we are going to go about our business there is no arrogance in the environment the work will begin tomorrow
1445268 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
1445269 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees

1445275 we had approximately 30 people up there from the search and rescue units we used some of the new equipment we have and the training and we were able to get everybody organized get them out in the woods and start looking for that young man
1445276 we had a helicopter that we used from dnr and we had gotten some k 9 units from huttonsville and we were starting to put those units in the field when we were able to find him
1445277 we realized that after that incident that we were really going to have to step things up in the area of search and rescue
1445278 the guys are motivated they like to do this kind of stuff
1445279 its something a little bit extra that you werent able to do in the state police before
1445280 its a sort of celebration we call it a way to tell crime that its on the way out
1445281 wed like to recognize that there are people that are really on our side and were working with them and theyve been really helpful to us in trying to solve a lot of problems in their areas
1445282 they keep on picking up more and more every year
1445283 its getting bigger all the time and its a good thing that we are encouraging people to look out for themselves the police cant be everywhere all of the time so were trying to tell them if they could help us we could get things accomplished a lot better
1445284 the only time weve been faced with increases of this magnitude was after hurricanes rita and katrina took out a lot of natural gas production in the gulf of mexico in 2005
1445285 these are unprecedented levels really of gas prices absent some sort of natural disaster like a hurricane
1445286 the magnitude is not too surprising even though its still a shock when youre talking about a 40 increase in bills
1445287 we think thats a better way to go rather than hammer people this winter lets try to spread this out for a couple years and ease into the pain if you will

1445392 is it probable that christ took an intoxicating liquor which in all the ages past had been the cause of misery and ruin and which in all the ages to come would destroy myriads in temporal and eternal destruction and he took the wine which his own inspired word declared was the poison of asps the poison of serpents the poison of dragons whose deadly bite is like a serpent and whose fatal sting is like an adder and made that the symbol of his atonement saying
1445393 the bible is not a wholesome endorsement of the use of the alcoholic cup
1445394 wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise
1445395 this or that word shouldnt have been translated that way and thus should have been translated this way
1445396 the greek or hebrew word really means this and not whats written
1445397 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
1445398 we have to quickly find a way to change the worlds consciousness about exactly what were facing
1445399 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
1445400 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
1445401 by marking the well you and anyone on your property driving a vehicle mixing chemicals whatever the practice will be more aware that the well is located in that spot
1445402 older wells can be very large and often theyre finished flush with the ground sometimes they dont have a good marker to let you know where it is
1445403 its a great program once people recognize its a valuable service by farmers for farmers theyll like it
1445404 grandiose but rigorously disciplined making a significant contribution to the cityscape with their exceptional architectural quality and landscaped open space
1445405 it was built to an unprecedented level of quality in terms of its materials internal spaces finishes and detailing the excellence of its modern art works and their complementary role to the internal architecture of its spaces is exceptional
1445406 respects its storey height and street rhythm rather than making a monumental statement the building addresses the context of a historic street and offers the city a plaza
1445407 the earth is already shaking beneath melting ice as rising temperatures threaten to shrink polar glaciers and raise sea levels around the world
1445408 new research appearing in todays issue of the journal science
1445409 melting could raise the sea level one to three feet over the next 100 to 150 years
1445410 increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the next century could raise arctic temperatures as much as 5 to 8 degrees
1445411 melting around the edges is exactly what the vikings saw on greenland 1 000 years ago when they named the island for its green coastal meadows
1445412 our panic prone scientists seem to have forgotten their own ice cores drilled deep into the greenland ice sheet in the 1980s
1445413 show it went from little ice age cold to modern warming warm in the ten years between 1845 and 1855 naturally
1445414 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
1445415 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god
1445416 the one thing we are sure of is that dublin and the east will start to run out of water from 2016 due to population growth and if it does the entire country will suffer
1445417 dublin city council has responsibility not to leave future generations without water and these studies which are at a very early stage will inform everyone of the possible options
1445418 in order to prevent any recurrence of fire damage it is intended to temporarily block up the openings so as to deny access to vandals
1445419 rpa is currently involved in negotiations to dispose of its interest in the property such disposal will take full cognisance of the need to restore and preserve this protected structure
1445420 will not be satisfied with a reinstatement of the roof
1445421 the excuse of negotiations is no reason for not maintaining the building
1445422 we would have been much happier if it had been sold but it wasnt
1445423 because its a listed building repairing it would need a conservation architect and the intention is that these works would start in october
1445424 all we could do was to present a vision but it didnt happen in dundrum because there wasnt sufficient interest
1445425 by marking the well you and anyone on your property driving a vehicle mixing chemicals whatever the practice will be more aware that the well is located in that spot
1445426 older wells can be very large and often theyre finished flush with the ground sometimes they dont have a good marker to let you know where it is
1445427 its a great program once people recognize its a valuable service by farmers for farmers theyll like it
1445428 a high percentage of the trucks stopped are in some violation
1445429 there will likely be more charges from the other 45

1445433 captures the local feel for the value in that fishery
1445434 the population pretty much hit an all time low around 2000 and 2001
1445435 fortunately there has been a subsequent recovery its not quite the same as what it was historically but by all accounts its a terrific fishery
1445436 the joint project is part of the companys ongoing public commitment to reduce its carbon footprint including the use of renewable and local fuel alternatives
1445437 it is widely accepted that using reclaimed industrial by products such as fly ash silica fume and slag commonly called supplementary cementing materials can reduce the amount of cement needed to make concrete
1445438 if you can have a concrete producer next to a cement plant thats a perfect combination
1445439 cement releases co2 and we capture that co2 and squeeze it back into the final product
1445440 the federal cleanup standards are stronger than new york states
1445441 i dont think people living on the great lakes think we need weaker environmental laws
1445442 we cant go back any further despite the fact that business might find this to be a cheap alternative to doing this onshore where they probably have to dispose of this stuff properly
1445443 why we allow the great lakes to be treated like a toilet bowl i dont know
1445444 defending the great lakes is like being in a constant war the more pro active things we do the better
1445445 i cant imagine that we would not be in support of banning this its illegal to do in canada and i think it should be illegal in the states as well
1445446 they simply have growth predictions that arent realistic and arent going to come true
1445447 so this is the new model for customer service totally transparent community driven involving multiple online channels including micro blogging and independent community forums youd better be ready for it because your customers no longer need your permission to talk about you
1445448 most of the time you dont need a report from your crm system you need just one answer about one customer
1445449 customer service would have to put people on hold and hunt for answers
1445450 these three markets desktop pc web browser and mobile along with servers have formed the pillars of microsoft upon which one of the worlds most profitable companies has been built
1445451 gnip wants to serve as the grand central station and universal translation service for the new social web
1445452 what we love about the model is that with some plain data into real usable information to dramatically improve the effectiveness of advertising and that as a fund we believe there are many more opportunities on the web to take unstructured data apply some algorithms and turn it into real valuable information the other beauty is that if we execute correctly it is an business
1445453 markets love icons we seek them out placeholders shorthand for a bigger idea or a shortcut to a good enough solution
1445454 success keeps going to people who build new icons not to those that seek to replace the most successful existing ones
1445455 here is a great factoid if not entirely surprising about the profits exchanges earn from trading versus trading data
1445456 the real problem is that the industrial economy is riddled with incentives to rip your head off sell you lemons maximize so called

1445489 we usually do an invocation and a pledge before we start
1445490 i dont know why we didnt but this young man reminded us
1445491 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1445492 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1445493 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1445494 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1445495 they are paying from 300 to 3 000 times more than the cost of tap water without any benefit
1445496 no es el ejecutivo el que decide la pena es el juez federal

1445498 as como en el pasado nos preocupaba que all e u fueran a imponer sanciones superiores a la pena m xima colombiana ahora nos preocupa que las negociaciones all con narcotraficantes lleven a que les impongan una pena pr cticamente indulgente que se convierte en motivo de burla
1445499 por lo menos les impongan una pena m nima severa
1445500 los acuerdos sugieren sentencias m nimas de 17 a os para dos de ellos y de 30 a os para el tercero eso en comparaci n con si no me equivoco 5 a 8 a os ac en colombia bajo el proceso de la ley de justicia y paz
1445501 es por eso que ped durante el fin de semana la visita de un representante de alto rango del departamento de justicia de los estados unidos que lleg en la noche del lunes a bogot y que va a consultar con autoridades de alto rango de la fiscal a de los tribunales la corte suprema del ministerio del interior y de la presidencia
1445502 as como en el pasado nos preocupaba que all e u fueran a imponer sanciones superiores a la pena m xima colombiana ahora nos preocupa que las negociaciones all con narcotraficantes lleven a que les impongan una pena pr cticamente indulgente que se convierte en motivo de burla
1445503 por lo menos les impongan una pena m nima severa
1445504 extra a mucho cuando se oye decir que hubo un acuerdo all con un juez de los estados unidos y que un narcotraficante pag una pena m nima y sale a vivir como un rey ese es un est mulo perverso
1445505 tambi n ha mandado un representante de alto rango a washington y a miami
1445506 queremos sanciones m ximas o queremos colaboraci n m xima en el futuro porque el uno no es igual al otro y en eso es evidente que tenemos que consultar m s entre fiscales

1445515 in contractul incheiat cu rcs rds antena1este un paragraf care spune ca televiziunea trebuie sa aiba acoperire
1445516 cluburile au dreptate sa fie nemultumite dar noi trebuie sa respectam contractul atunci cand am facut caietul de sarcini s au facut trei adunari generale stiam ca acest consortiu nu va da mai departe drepturile de televizare strategia este a lor pentru ca ei au dat banii
1445517 doua meciuri pe etapa vor ramane netelevizate iar cluburile trebuiau sa se ridice si sa sesizeze aceasta problema la adunarile generale dinaintea licitatiei pentru drepturile de televizare
1445518 oricum cluburile nu pierd pentru ca audientele inregistrate sunt mici ele oricum si au luat banii iar asa vine mai multa lume pe stadion

1445520 this is very hard on not only me but because this is a working ranch my entire family is involved wife sons and daughters son in law daughter in law
1445521 we all make a living off of this ranch not only was it disturbing for him to kill all those buffalo but we sell the offsprings to make a living
1445522 i dont know anyone that is crazy to shoot that many buffalo you dont know what hell do next there is a lot of fear now for a bit there we didnt know who was responsible for this and we werent sleeping at night locking doors the women were dreaming etc
1445523 this is not acceptable to do to animals or another persons property
1445524 he needs more than a slap on the hand jail time certainly isnt out of the question and he definitely needs to pay me and everybody else involved back for our loss and expenses
1445525 there has been extensive damage to mr hawns fences to his trees and to the grass on his property
1445526 as this problem has continued for the last six weeks and you indicated that you are unsure if you will be able to resolve the issue yourself we are considering alternate remedies such as allowing a hunt of any buffalo that come onto mr hawns property
1445527 however we would certainly prefer to resolve this problem amicably without having to resort to such action
1445528 you may hunt them and remove them or you may remove them live and take them to the location of your choice
1445529 the massacre of the bison occurred six days after monte downare received the paperwork from the civil suit
1445530 in an homage to old school arcade action the game forgoes the use of continues or game saving meaning that youll need to play through from the start on every new try this is actually not as bad as you might think considering that there are only five relatively short levels
1445531 you can collect pick ups to switch between three different weapon types a wide pattern a spread pattern and a straight laser shot stick with the laser
1445532 also if you are playing with a friend your regular homing missiles are instead turned into special team attacks like the lightning strike pictured above as fun as this may sound it unfortunately doesnt really feel like the super attack you wish you had sure it looks really cool but i missed my homing missiles
1445533 even though i struggled with it a little this title is everything a retro remake should be it does very little wrong if anything
1445534 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1445535 i have noticed that every once in a while the phone will re boot itself when i click one of the new application icons it has happened with more than one application so i dont know if the applications are coded wrong or if the 2 0 firmware has bugs
1445536 i havent had any application crash since updating the firmware crashes were pretty consistent prior to updating
1445537 that means the united states consumes as much as 50 000 tons of petroleum based toner powder each year now every office employee can help reduce dependence on oil every time they put a toner cartridge in their printer
1445538 as we developed this soy cartridge we realized if we looked at the entire printing process any office can significantly reduce the environmental impact on our planet
1445539 this is truly the most environmentally sustainable way to print
1445540 the fans viciously attacked and physically assaulted him when he went to a concession stand
1445541 they took it personally and i dont blame them mahan said after meeting with pga president brian whitcomb and ceo joe steranka
1445542 i deserve what i get i take full responsibility for what i said
1445543 could care less about winning because they decide where it is played based on where it can make the most money
1445544 and from what ive heard the whole week is extremely long mahan said in the interview
1445545 youve got dinners every night not little dinners but huge massive dinners i know as players thats the last thing we want to do we want to prepare ourselves thats part of the whole thing youre just a slave that week
1445546 then my dad called and said he heard it on the golf channel mahan said
1445547 i guess they hammered me pretty good and it kind of erupted from there
1445548 it was a chance to enlighten him about the ryder cup and pga of america activities whitcomb said tuesday morning
1445549 we saw a talented young man who would like to play in the ryder cup and knew he had made a mistake and was looking to amend those mistakes i appreciated that
1445550 those comments sounded like they were 9 years old he said
1445551 because they are not relevant to what the ryder cup is today
1445552 the crowd you could hear it a mile away we had to sit at one hole and wait for people to come through and it was just crazy you could see the energy on everybodys faces
1445553 from what ive heard the ryder cup just isnt fun mahan said in the magazine interview
1445554 the fun is sucked right out of it thats the word i hear a lot
1445555 just from the presidents cup having such a good time it was disappointing to hear about the ryder cup that it wasnt as much fun i was disappointed to hear that about an event i had looked up to as a kid
1445556 i should have said in the article how much i want to change the culture of the ryder cup and start winning mahan said

1445560 gives little reason to expect a september rate hike which we previously had thought was possible
1445561 while the committee is undoubtedly concerned about inflation the statement points to an expected moderation in inflation and implicitly notes the recent fall in energy and some commodity prices
1445562 it was all pretty dramatic the girls were due on stage in about three minutes time when he ran up to them hed clearly had far too much to drink and was stumbling about the place somehow he got backstage and within yards of the group
1445563 luckily their security team was on the ball and intercepted him before he was able to do anything untoward but it took three burly guys to bring him down as he was getting really aggressive
1445564 the girls were total troupers and despite being a bit shaken they simply went out and gave a brilliant performance like nothing had happened the security team was very discreet and didnt want to worry them unduly
1445565 but once they were safely on stage the decision was made to call the police to get the guy arrested in the end after apologising profusely he was released without charge
1445566 well probably see a break for a couple of hours through the late morning and early afternoon
1445567 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1445568 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1445569 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1445570 i have noticed that every once in a while the phone will re boot itself when i click one of the new application icons it has happened with more than one application so i dont know if the applications are coded wrong or if the 2 0 firmware has bugs
1445571 i havent had any application crash since updating the firmware crashes were pretty consistent prior to updating
1445572 for true knowledge only comes thru understanding ones own questions
1445573 you cant have great software without a great team and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families
1445574 for true knowledge only comes thru understanding ones own questions
1445575 you cant have great software without a great team and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families
1445576 really what we have here is an arrogance of power
1445577 its a great ruling for the teachers and the state employees
1445578 it essentially says the government cant use the pension fund as a rainy day fund
1445579 instead of seeking a tax increase or cuts in other state programs that did not enjoy special constitutional protection defendants diverted the employer contributions to the retirement system
1445580 keeps retirement funds where they should be with retirees who have dedicated their careers to serving the public
1445581 security must always be at the top of our israels agenda
1445582 it is convenient at times to delude ourselves temporarily especially in relatively quiet times that security issues are not urgent or our main concern i say this is a dangerous delusion
1445583 its blatantly discriminatory to single out people with hiv its stupid and ridiculous
1445584 these restrictions are really impeding our ability to control hiv and aids
1445585 i told him no because i thought it was stupid and discriminatory
1445586 its been humiliating to constantly be classified as a criminal
1445587 i think its great that america has finally seen the light
1445588 this is huge not only for the people who have not been able to enter the u s but finally these laws might be overturned throughout the world
1445589 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1445590 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1445591 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1445592 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1445593 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1445594 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1445595 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1445596 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1445597 i dont know what i would have done to be publicly embarrassed like that no uh uh
1445598 i really hope she looks good when she shows up i dont want to write a story about how shitty christie brinkley looks post divorce
1445599 im just so glad to get back to events like these that are so fulfilling
1445600 i love the wild west so i just have this craving to get out there and ride a horse and swim in a waterfall
1445601 which stirred left liberal discussion from alter to vanden the rich who in fact cling most tightly to amorphous cultural issues in the past 50 years working class whites have actually become
1445602 whats the matter with tom frank and the lefties who love him
1445603 leftists refusal to take on the culture war has more to do with their own conservative impulses than with any rational strategy for a progressive revival
1445604 all states are built to steal and exploit including the american state founded in 1776
1445605 conservatives merely take away the hope for them there is no conceivable instance in which the state might be reformed or function morally only oppression succeeding oppression all the way to the far horizon

1445612 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
1445613 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
1445614 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
1445615 they say that time will make all this go away but its time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
1445616 it should be seen as a sign that the family is healing

1445618 to recap what the red sox have acquired is perhaps the best right handed hitter available at the trade deadline
1445619 heyman has a good column up that notes that the red sox
1445620 how can we lock in as much of that as is humanly possible
1445621 that boras and ramirez together orchestrated mannys recent events is indisputable in my mind anyway sans evidence other than what we see and know about them
1445622 nick i guess giving up the prospects might have dissuaded some contenders but two months of manny at no salary cost plus the two draft picks if when he left seems like that would attract more than three teams
1445623 speaknig of blowing it ibm its nice to see that kyle farnsworth can still let the yankees and in this case the sox down did you see that horrific 3er in 1ip performance he tossed against the rays yesterday to blow the tigers lead have fun with that jim leyland
1445624 did you see statements from the sox fo about picking these options up if so i am curious to see how they were worded i dont recall them
1445625 farnsy tooketh away what the oc gaveth you yesterday in that horrific 8th
1445626 i could not fathom a situation in which the red sox would not pick up the first option
1445627 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1445628 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first game where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1445629 were too talented of a team to take tough shots because theres always going to be someone open
1445630 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ball game
1445631 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1445632 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1445633 we cant have those types of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1445634 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1445635 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1445636 we have a familiarity with each other this was absolutely the best preparation we could have going into next week
1445637 it definitely was a high quality game but we still have a long way to go
1445638 tonight was a chance to see where we stand and i look forward to seeing them again
1445639 weve never observed it in any sampling weve ever done
1445640 theyve found our forces we must attack now sparrow order general silver to being operation zulu immediately weve just lost the element of surprise but at least we outnumber them fly
1445641 well to be honest none of us have ever been to africa
1445642 from what ive heard its incredibly hot theres little food or water and ive just found out a theres a huge population of apes thanks but no thanks christopher another tom collins and a rob roy for the reporter
1445643 we just finished counting all the bugs and were looking forward to a little time off
1445644 well at least we wont be in this damn swamp anymore damn mosquitoes keep biting umm bill minus one to the mosquito count
1445645 man i tried it with construction paper wax paper even origami paper sure you get a different high with each of those but its not a good ol american coke high you get from a benjamin now who wants to get down
1445646 its your materialistic society that pushes people to drugs in a futile effort to reach self satisfaction quite frankly i believe the attachment to possessions are killing americans and you guys take the coke as a form of suicide im happy with what i have
1445647 someone pay attention to us someone ok i guess ill just use this needle i found on the ground hello
1445648 7 00 zorg dat de baby wakker is en de luier verschoond voed hem niet later dan 7 00

1445651 i went sky diving i went rocky mountain climbing i went two point seven seconds on a bull named fu man chu and i loved deeper and i spoke sweeter and i gave forgiveness id been denying
1445652 natuur is voor tevredenen of legen en dan wat is natuur nog in dit land een stukje bos ter grootte van een krant een heuvel met wat villaatjes ertegen geef mij de grauwe stedelijke wegen de in kaden vastgeklonken waterkant de wolken nooit zo schoon dan als ze omrand door zolderramen langs de lucht bewegen alles is veel voor wie niet veel verwacht het leven houdt zijn wonderen verborgen tot het ze opeens toont in hun hogen staat dit heb ik bij mijzelven overdacht verregend op een miezerige morgen domweg gelukkig in de dapperstraat
1445653 ben ik achter in de winkel bezig dan heb je soms mensen die binnenkomen en ongeduldig bij de kassa gaan staan tikken
1445654 ik zeg dan wel eens tegen ze dit is een dorpswinkel maar dat begrijpen ze niet even wachten of een praatje van twee minuten kost mensen tegenwoordig blijkbaar geld
1445655 alle buurvrouwen heetten toen nog tante en als er iemand dood was legde de hele buurt geld bijeen voor een bloemenkrans mensen keken naar elkaar om op vakantie naar veneti werd eens de portemonnee van mijn vader gejat de hele bus legde geld bijeen trouwens wilde je vakantie boeken dan moest je op tijd zijn bij reisbureau eurotex voor de zomervakantie stond er een rij van honderden meters want op was op dat is ook een verschil met vroeger jongeren hebben nu alles en ze geven anderen de schuld als ze het niet hebben ik kom uit de generatie van na de oorlog voor ons kon het allemaal eigenlijk alleen maar beter worden
1445656 monique van de ven woonde hier ik herkende haar in de zaak een dag nadat ik haar blote borsten had gezien in turks fruit en phil bloom en ook daisy dynamite destijds de bekendste travestiet van amsterdam
1445657 maar voor een gewoon mens zijn huizen hier niet meer te betalen
1445658 mijn hele assortiment staat nu ook bij de albert heijn die ook nog eens dag en nacht open is
1445659 zelf weiger ik om op zondag open te zijn zoals ik ook weiger om allemaal moderne bewakingssnufjes te installeren ik weiger het pertinent om politieagent te zijn ooit had ik een klant die altijd pikte het was best een aardige vrouw maar het leek wel of ze niet anders kon ik sloeg dan gewoon wat extras aan op de kassa en dat was dat zo ging het vroeger met meer van die dingen ik heb een tijdje geregeld dubbel geparkeerd toen de hele straat hier nog volgepropt stond met autos maar niemand had daar last van oom agent zag het wel maar hij reed gewoon door
1445660 dan zeggen sommige mensen daar krijg je zeker geld voor
1445661 waarom toch je hoeft toch niet overal geld aan te verdienen en mijn kleinkinderen hebben nu elk zon vier verschillende juffen op school waar is dat voor nodig denk ik dan ik was vroeger erg gehecht aan mijn onderwijzer ik ben vele jaren later nog naar zijn begrafenis geweest ik merk het ook aan de vertegenwoordigers die hier langskomen als je een keer niks van ze nodig hebt moeten ze dat noteren en helemaal verantwoorden aan hun baas anders komen ze in de problemen
1445662 neem die politieagenten van vandaag een tijdje voor de invoering van de euro kreeg ik eens een boete van achttienhonderd gulden achttienhonderd gulden van de milieupolitie omdat ik een reclamebord had buitengezet niet eerst een waarschuwing gelijk op de bon voor mij was dat ellendig want het kostte me mn vakantiegeld maar ik denk dan ook wat een pokkebaan heeft zon agent die mensen worden met de nek aangekeken en stel je eens voor wat een vervelende opmerkingen die mensen allemaal krijgen op verjaardagsfeestjes enzo zeg je dat je politieagent bent beginnen mensen gelijk tegen je te klagen
1445663 in de winkel lok ik altijd gesprekken uit het contact met de mensen maakt het werken leuk als ik in de albert heijn bij de kassa kom denk ik meisje toch hoe hou je het hier uit al die artikelen doorsluizen en nooit een leuk gesprek ik weet ook wel dat zeventienjarigen nog niet zo gemakkelijk met iedereen een praatje maken maar vaak kijken de mensen de caissi re niet eens aan blijven ze gewoon bellen met hun mobiele telefoon terwijl ze hun pincode intikken
1445664 nu vliegt het tuig het schuim de hele wereld rond
1445665 je bent gewoon een beetje verkouden man je moet niet gelijk die rotzooi slikken
1445666 het maakt niet uit wat je doet je moet er z lf wat van maken
1445667 en als ik met de kleinkinderen op stap ben let ik er altijd op dat ze mensen beleefd groeten en alstublieft en dankuwel zeggen fantastisch zeggen mensen dan maar het is natuurlijk helemaal niet fantastisch het is gewoon de wijze waarop je met elkaar hoort om te gaan
1445668 ik ga al tien jaar niet meer naar de stembus kijk vroeger stemde je om er allemaal beter van te worden nu stem je alleen voor jezelf en als ik dan lees dat verdonk en wilders de ontwikkelingshulp willen afschaffen ik vind dat onbegrijpelijk ik ben ook maar een gewone amsterdamse jongen maar dan denk ik als we nou allemaal wat geld bij elkaar zouden leggen kun je toch heel wat problemen oplossen
1445669 i have my hat ready just in case i need to puke in it
1445670 oh little siri were home youre not going to puke
1445671 he wants people to remember him because of his actions not for his pictures
1445672 the president will be one of other candidates for the presidency and he doesnt want that there are more pictures of him than of anybody else
1445673 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1445674 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1445675 documents describing the creation of explosives as well as excerpts from the anarchists arsenal
1445676 siddiquis papers included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
1445677 may the blood of unintelligible be directly on your unintelligible possibly head or hands
1445678 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1445679 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1445680 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1445681 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1445682 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1445683 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1445684 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1445685 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1445686 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1445687 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1445688 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1445689 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1445690 it underscores that barack obama isnt being straightforward with voters and has the bad judgment americans cant afford right now
1445691 to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion silver or standard silver dollars in the treasury
1445692 a great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit our system of credit is concentrated in the federal reserve system the growth of the nation therefore and all our activities are in the hands of a few men we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of small groups of dominant men
1445693 the flight returned to lax after take off after the pilot reported smoke in the cockpit
1445694 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1445695 what was given to solana was the telephone conversation transcript and not a response to the proposed package
1445696 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1445697 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1445698 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1445699 the goal for our next project is something very very different so its a little scary because we dont know what it is exactly were getting a much clearer sense every single day in terms of what were doing deciding whats in and out of the game but its going to be aggressive
1445700 i actually cant talk about it without talking about the game itself there are things related to story gameplay and i dont know how to describe it peoples relationship with the game over the long term thats what were thinking about but its about as clear as i can be
1445701 i am a ski instructor working in arinsal in andorra in the winter months i am english in reality the swedish tag was started as a joke and stuck i used it here to differentiate from my official web presence at ianhuyton com

1445707 the right of the viewers and listeners not the right of the broadcasters which is paramount
1445708 the broadcast company is fulfilling a contract between itself as the user of a public asset and the public body that owns the asset as with all contracts both parties to the agreement need to know exactly the responsibilities that they have to each other with minimum standards spelled out there is no question as a broadcaster i would like to know what is expected of me in serving the public interest required minimum standards and a voluntary code provide the benefit of certainty to broadcasters i like to know what the rules are

1445714 weve been practising for this tournament for a long time with the players we have and the preparations weve made theres no telling what we can do or how far we can go
1445715 i think we have a squad capable of showing the world they are good enough for the gold medal the entire nation is banking on this set of players
1445716 the opening game is always important because it sets the tone for what comes next even so we prefer to get off to a low profile start if you do that then you can only improve
1445717 if we play with a winning mentality we can go very far in this tournament were not the favourites but well do everything we can to go a long way were a group of friends who want to make their mark on world football and these games are our chance to do just that
1445718 the nhs is one of the astounding human endeavour s of modern times
1445719 if we fail to think about the energy issue appropriately if we trivialize the complexities or yield to the temptation to wish for a magical quick fix we will not get there from here
1445720 we must know where we are and where we must go we must get the goal right get the plan right and get it done
1445721 as a way of framing our understanding i would suggest that we must think in terms of btus not the british thermal units of energy or heat but behaviors technologies and underlying principles
1445722 we must create the incentives disincentives and level of awareness needed to alter individual behaviors corporate behaviors and leading by example governmental behaviors
1445723 the fact that im black was the only obvious reason
1445724 fell for many reasons but three reasons are worth remembering declining moral values and political civility at home an overconfident and overextended military in foreign lands and fiscal irresponsibility by the central government

1445750 republicans have been escalating their attacks on democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama ill and the democrats over oil drilling and we need to push back hard
1445751 speaker pelosi blocked their plan because it wont help lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans
1445752 but republicans are working hard to make it seem like theyre fighting for cash strapped commuters and not the oil companies who wrote their plan
1445753 weve invited the media and having a good crowd is critical to show them that voters dont want oil industry gimmicks they want real solutions like alternative energy to solve our energy crisis

1445758 la navigation personnelle ainsi que les services aux entreprises devraient tre les deux segments les plus r mun rateurs sur les cinq cat gories de services localis s que nous avons r pertori s
1445759 ce qui est notable sur ce secteur des services localis s c est que les informations des fournisseurs de contenus sont disponibles
1445760 cuil searches more pages on the web than anyone else three times as many as google and ten times as many as microsoft
1445761 rather than trying to mimic googles method of ranking the quantity and quality of links to web sites patterson says cuils technology drills into the actual content of a page and cuils results will be presented in a more magazine like format instead of just a vertical stack of web links cuils results are displayed with more photos spread horizontally across the page and include sidebars that can be clicked on to learn more about topics related to the original search request
1445762 our approach is to focus on the content of a page and then present a set of results that has both depth and breadth our aim is to give you a wider range of more detailed results and the opportunity to explore more fully the different ideas behind your search we think this approach is more useful to you than a simple list so cuil searches the web for pages with your keywords and then we analyze the rest of the text on those pages this tells us that the same word has several different meanings in different contexts are you looking for jaguar the cat the car or the operating system we sort out all those different contexts so that you dont have to waste time rephrasing your query when you get the wrong result
1445763 porque se levantar n falsos cristos y falsos profetas y har n se ales y prodigios para enga ar si fuese posible aun a los escogidos
1445764 jes s de nazareth ven a bajo un pacto de maldici n entonces ven a como pobre porque ven a a cumplir la ley ahora la manifestaci n de jesucristo hombre es totalmente contraria ahora que es el reinado de jesucristo hombre viene bajo un pacto de gracia diferente es un hombre millonario no por jactancia o soberbia porque es sencillo pero a l le toca gobernar con la herencia de todas las naciones

1445769 caffeine stimulates your nervous system signaling the body to release a small amount of energy from its fat stores
1445770 but stirring in milk cream or sugar can cause your insulin levels to rise which diminishes that metabolic effect
1445771 the most important factor affecting your weight is how many total calories you eat each day not what the clock reads when you eat them
1445772 our brains satiety mechanism the bodies way of telling us were ready to stop eating tends to become weaker as the day progresses
1445773 that means you may have to eat more in the evening in order to feel full
1445774 people incorrectly assume that if youre using fat for fuel it equates to losing body fat
1445775 but what affects weight loss most is how many calories youve depleted during your workout and if youve sustained a deficit by the days end
1445776 theres no science proving that any particular food can burn melt or flush away fat
1445777 if a woman loses weight on a grapefruit or cabbage soup plan its likely because she has cut calories by restricting her intake to a handful of foods
1445778 youd almost certainly lose weight eating 1 000 calories of anything whether its bananas or potato chips
1445779 but it will be pretty tough to keep the pounds from returning once you return to your normal diet

1445789 i have been told that some diocesan standing committees have graciously offered to reconsider their denial of consent to my election as the xiv bishop of south carolina if they only have assurance of my intention to remain in the episcopal church
1445790 although i previously provided assurance of my intention this has not been sufficient for some standing committees which are earnestly seeking to make a godly discernment
1445791 as i stated at the walkabout in charleston on september 9 2006 and again in a statement written on 6 november 2006 i will make the vows of conformity as written in the book of common prayer and the constitution amp canons iii 11 8 i will heartily make the vows conforming to the doctrine discipline and worship of the episcopal church as well as the trustworthiness of the holy scriptures so to put it as clearly as i can my intention is to remain in the episcopal church

1445841 for over two years amazon web services has provided infrastructure services that help companies of all sizes from small startups to larger enterprises realize the cost time and scaling efficiencies of cloud computing we believe that cloud computing will continue to grow into a large industry with companies providing a range of different services
1445842 elastra has an experienced team with a unique software approach that helps enterprise companies realize the benefits of cloud computing
1445843 we took a hard look at the value businesses see in cloud computing it was clear that enterprises need a complete and integrated way to manage entire applications in cloud environments we feel elastra has set their sights on the right segment of the market enterprises whose applications need a holistic architected approach to managing cloud based systems rather than libraries of machines that are tied together with random scripts

1445846 ibms hpc open source stack results from long experience with keeping large scale computing systems running like clockwork
1445847 as more and more computing tasks migrate to supercomputer style clusters there is a need for software that can effectively utilize and manage the large number of processors found in these systems
1445848 managing thousands of processor cores and multiple types of processors is a challenge we see every day and it will only grow in the future
1445849 the ibm hpc stack and other items in the repository help open source supercomputer users and systems managers keep pace with the rapid advances in cluster computing they are in constant need of improved software components since the hardware advances so quickly

1445870 we have a lot of wind and rain right now of course we always feel very fortunate when we dont get a direct hit galveston is used to tropical storms fortunately this did not become a hurricane
1445871 however we are asking our residents and visitors to stay indoors until this rain event and wind have passed over the island which could be some hours from now we dont want to become complacent because these storms can come right around and go back to the gulf or hang around for a while
1445872 were still prepared and we still have our emergency operations in order and were carefully monitoring the weather

1445876 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1445877 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1445878 if we fail to act there are severe indications for national security our economy and our environment
1445879 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1445880 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1445881 ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1445882 a number that seems out of step with published estimates of 250 000 to 1 million bpd
1445883 its almost a desperate attempt to take advantage of the political climate brought on by high energy prices to steamroll through legislation that wont fundamentally address those high energy prices
1445884 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1445885 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first game where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1445886 were too talented of a team to take tough shots because theres always going to be someone open
1445887 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ball game
1445888 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1445889 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1445890 we cant have those types of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1445891 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1445892 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1445893 one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1445894 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
1445895 purewire could be one of the top web security companies in the world
1445896 the market for software as a service they are going after is nascent its brand new
1445897 which should give them a lot of runway to make a lot of progress
1445898 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1445899 since friday the republicans in congress have been playing to the television cameras with theatrical stunts because speaker pelosi blocked their offshore drilling plan the republican plan will not lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans

1445907 perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water
1445908 not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1445909 its a very effective agent for soaking up water like a silica gel packet
1445910 when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze
1445911 there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant
1445912 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1445913 there were reports over the weekend that indicated that nasa had a major discovery that nasa was withholding from the public todays teleconference is going to set the record straight
1445914 we have substantial evidence that our soil samples has perchlorates
1445915 they are highly stable and do not destroy life under normal conditions in fact there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1445916 we dont know what mixture of perchlorate salts we have in our solution sodium perchlorate ammonium perchlorate magnesium perchlorate lets take magnesium perchlorate its a very effective agent for soaking up water like silica gel packet when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze weve only begun to think about what this might mean but they could keep a lot of graduate students busy for a long time
1445917 its a stable molecule and it doesnt preclude life on earth in fact it could be an energy source
1445918 there were some initial reports in the the scientific literature that the atacama was very mars like they couldnt find organics or culture microbes but as research continued we found organics and then when we looked closer we found microbes so it turned around microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions and the story could be the same for mars we dont know for sure
1445919 the other probes had different focuses than the meca wet chem which is looking for soluble salt and perchlorate is a very soluble salt
1445920 because perchlorates are chemically inert they move through the soil very quickly in the presence of water this ties back to mars perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1445921 nasa is investigating whether the substance could have gotten there by contamination before launch
1445922 even the scientists admitted to having to hit the textbooks on how it works perhaps the most intriguing suggestion was that magnesium perchlorate can act as a sort of anti freeze in the presence of water
1445923 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1445924 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1445925 obama does not support off shore drilling or nuclear power
1445926 i am really glad that the government continues to pour 10 000 000 000 each month on iraqi soil while it cuts funding for roads on which we ride in our own country
1445927 jp you obviously dont ride all of you left wing liberals are well on your way to getting what you desire most higher taxes do any of you really know what nobama s agenda is oh and besides the extremely vague hope amp change platform why are you voting for him
1445928 i don t know which bikers you hang out with but most of the ones i know are far from liberal they are veterans and they tend to support other veterans they buy harley davidson motorcycles not just because they are fine machines but because they are made in america they believe in freedom and individual responsibility does that sound liberal
1445929 sorry to tell you my friends theres going to be more wars
1445930 a true statesmen for the people is ron paul no more needless wars a return to a sound money policy and legalizing the constitution things all americans should support yet don t
1445931 freedom makes a huge requirement of every human being with freedom comes responsibility for the person who is unwilling to grow up the person who does not want to carry is own weight this is a frightening prospect
1445932 your snide remark is an indication of why obama will lose he doesn t understand the true heartbeat of america
1445933 its a shame when we have all these economic problems that the same people who cant afford to pay for their homes are willing to dash to the newsstands and feed the frenzy that causes magazine editors to spend millions
1445934 its a reflection of the appetite for seeing the children of celebs and also our big interest in judging other mothers
1445935 we are delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity through the jolie pitt foundation
1445936 its either the biggest photo victory ever or the biggest black eye on the journalism business you could imagine
1445937 i used to say its a gamble but now i think its a sure bet they will make it all back maybe not in a specific issue but in free publicity and promotion from the articles even negative ones that will be written about them
1445938 anyone who thinks that will stop the stalkerazzi theyre wrong it didnt work in the old days and it doesnt work now no matter how much money is out there
1445939 in our business there are almost no rules so the fact that the stars are turning the business on its head is probably a natural progression
1445940 the women who read our blog especially the new mothers they feel a connection to these celebrities as if they were family members so theres a natural inclination to want to see the baby pictures of someone you care about
1445941 if a practice is wrong it doesnt matter what the consequences are
1445942 sharing baby photos with family and friends is one thing but having these images put on magazines and on the internet forever is a different story
1445943 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear
1445944 we have got to create this new mechanism to be able to turn the aids vaccine into a normal product development initiative so that every time there a failure it doesnt raise the question of whether this is the end of the line
1445945 strong scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
1445946 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone
1445947 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process

1445949 i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other
1445950 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1445951 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1445952 we hope that historic photos of virginia will be a catalyst for preservation that people will look at the images and captions remember the places that are gone and recognize the buildings that still stand and work to preserve them

1445993 it has been an amazing experience for us right from the first auditions to tonights amazing show and victory it was great to perform in the presence of dhoni and yuvraj sir we were nervous in the beginning of the episode but as we performances our confidence rose we are very grateful to the entire 9xs gini amp jony chak de bachche team especially the choregraphers and production team and we will miss them all they are like family for us now and we could have never got to where we are today if it hadnt been for their continual encouragement and faith we thank the team the judges and the audiences who supported us but we owe this win to manoj tiwari we will never forget this experience for as long as we live
1445994 the main reason that gini amp jony chak de bachche was such a huge success was because of the sheer enthusiasm and fresh untapped talent that all the children involved have
1445995 the talent here tonight is unbelievable and the excitement on stage was infectious
1445996 i enjoy dancing but im not half as talented a dancer as these kids its great to see them receive such encouragement so early in their lives i hope they develop the god given gifts they have received in the form of their talent and pursue careers in the fields of their choice i wish them all the best
1445997 it is fantastic to see children from smaller towns getting such a good platform to showcase their talents im over happy to see deepak and nishtha live up to the high expectations of all the people supporting them giving them hope to fulfill their own dreams
1445998 it feels good to be a part of such a show and we appreciate the appearances that both yuvraj and dhoni made tonight
1445999 the competition between the jodis was very tough tonight and though it was a pleasure judging the episode it was not an easy job we tried to guide the kids well and we would like them to concentrate on their studies for now their talent is astounding and can surely take them to the heights that they aspire for and wish them well
1446000 it was my role in the competition to judge the screen presence of each child and each one was a winner there is a lot of uptapped talent in the far flung areas of our country and shows such as gini amp jony chak de bachche are as asset for our countrys future

1446360 we did set up some security standards in the beginning and encryption was critical
1446361 we dont believe the security or privacy of these would be members will be compromised in any way
1446362 but out of an abundance of caution and in keeping with a policy of always leveling with our members we wanted to issue this warning regardless of which state law may or may not require it
1446363 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1446364 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals where criminals are able to breach computer security systems as alleged here they have enormous ability to cause harm

1446366 customers are always asking whats the most important thing to get done when we release security updates
1446367 the new exploitability index helps with that problem were going to give predictions on how exploitable each issue is
1446368 its another piece of information another piece to the puzzle
1446369 i think its usefulness will depend on the implementation and how accurate the predictions are but it should help emphasize the need to look at exploitability as one of the factors in deciding what to patch

1446371 i dont have to tell you that this takes some people at microsoft outside their comfort level

1446373 well do the reverse engineering in many cases that will id where the vulnerability is
1446374 you have to give them credit that theyre putting effort into the security process
1446375 its not a silver bullet to the problem but more information is always better both of these are kind of interesting and show that microsoft is being more proactive in the security space

1446425 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1446426 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1446427 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1446428 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1446429 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1446430 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1446431 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1446432 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1446433 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1446434 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1446435 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1446436 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1446437 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery

1446459 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1446460 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1446461 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1446462 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1446463 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1446464 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1446465 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1446466 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1446467 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1446468 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1446469 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1446470 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1446471 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1446472 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1446473 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother
1446474 public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance
1446475 we would like to see that everyone who wants an elmo live will be able to get one
1446476 this pre order opportunity offers the best chance to those who order now that they will have elmo live on october 14th when it goes on sale in stores nationwide
1446477 with a toy as exciting as this one it is impossible to predict accurately just how many will be needed to ultimately meet consumer demand
1446478 elmo live is one of top 12 toys this christmas and were sure it will be flying off the shelves just as quickly as we can stack it up
1446479 were committed to staying ahead of demand and the opportunity for our customers to pre order online at walmart com ensures that every child who wants an elmo live will have one this holiday season
1446480 elmo live delivers a rich play experience that is engaging and interactive its as close to being with elmo in the fur as any toy has ever been
1446481 we anticipate that this will be sold out very early in the season so taking advantage of this pre sale opportunity will be a key strategy for anyone who wants to score one of these toys
1446482 with todays technology weve been able to make the magic between child and toy even more seamless and exciting than ever
1446483 this elmo is packed with unprecedented movement and an abundance of creative content never before featured in a plush product
1446484 the other elmo toys made you laugh and dance but elmo live really touches you its so amazingly alive
1446485 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1446486 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1446487 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1446488 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease
1446489 having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
1446490 the assay can be used to easily measure hepcidin in the blood of all vertebrates
1446491 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1446492 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1446493 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1446494 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1446495 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1446496 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1446497 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1446498 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1446499 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1446500 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1446501 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1446502 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1446503 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1446504 hemos decidido suspender el viaje a tarija porque hubo agresiones contra periodistas contra las delegaciones anticipadas de argentina y venezuela con un fascismo de las peores pocas
1446505 acusamos directamente al imperio de estados unidos que hace todo lo posible para evitar nuestra uni n
1446506 esto nos indica que el imperio americano no puede ser desestimado
1446507 creemos que la irresponsabilidad de algunos dirigentes est conduciendo a estos hechos lamentables
1446508 va a continuar para que el presidente no pise territorio tarije o
1446509 el presidente reitera la necesidad de permitir que todos los medios de comunicaci n tengan igual y oportuno acceso a las noticias m s importantes
1446510 es grave que integrantes de las fuerzas armadas filtren noticias de manera clandestina y sin coordinaci n con sus superiores
1446511 adem s es grave que en las primeras investigaciones sobre la operaci n no haya salido a relucir toda la verdad
1446512 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived
1446513 if you dont win anything in the south you need 70 percent of the rest of the country
1446514 if you can win some of the south that gives you breathing space
1446515 if this house ever caught on fire it could do a lot of damage around the neighborhood youd hear the last shots fired in the civil war
1446516 while adolescent african american females remain a high risk group for stds little research has examined their marijuana use sexual behaviors and incidence of std infection
1446517 although no differences in condom use were identified between marijuana users and non users results suggest that marijuana users are engaging in sexual acts with riskier partners and under riskier circumstances and had higher rates of stds
1446518 one of you will die but you choose which one
1446519 we have to stop the emperor from getting the diamond oh he got the diamond ok we have to stop the emperor from putting it at the top of the magic tower oh he did that too ok we have to stop the emperor from getting to shangri la oh hes there now ok
1446520 im standing here till i see who comes around the corner
1446521 i am very excited about this championship it is a big day for us
1446522 we have been working for long hours sometimes even till 10pm
1446523 apart from bhaichung and sunil chhetri there is no indian striker who gets a regular start in any of the clubs
1446524 we have sushil and abhishek yadav in the squad who hardly get to play for their clubs the other boy tarif ahmed whom we had to send back has the same problem
1446525 my best performance for india came when david booth was the coach of mahindra united i got many starts and once in an afc cup game when we were down to 10 men he went to the extent of substituting the foreign recruit keeping me on
1446526 when you get a chance after a long time you are afraid to experiment and your growth stops
1446527 the match confidence is never there when you play after a long time
1446528 yadav pointed out that the dependence on foreign strikers was forcing quality players to switch positions and play in midfield
1446529 they need to play to get noticed there are more places in the midfield than up front
1446530 i struggled with injuries last season but now i am completely fit and would look for more games
1446531 we reached beijing yesterday after a five day training session in malaysia the games village is beautiful and the accommodation too is good the entire atmosphere is very lively we had a training round in the morning and it went off well
1446532 before reaching here we had a short training stint in malaysia the practice load was not much and basically it was an acclimatisation camp moreover the climate in langkawi malaysia is similar to beijings and the time difference too is not much
1446533 expectations are natural as we are among the very few sportspersons who are representing such a large nation
1446534 i definitely feel more responsible and it reminds me that there are so many people who are behind me so i have to do my best to live up to their expectations
1446535 but there is no unnecessary pressure because of this at the same time it is also very motivating when people tell me that they will pray for me and they believe in me
1446536 a gold medallist at 2006 melbourne commonwealth games avneet got a shot in the arm before the beijing olympics as she was named among the 11 arjuna award winners on monday
1446537 when i got to know about the award in the morning i was very excited and could not concentrate on my practice initially
1446538 built to a price point that often entails some serious photographic compromises the a590 is makes relatively few its fast precise has decent high iso performance meters accurately and provides full manual control
1446539 its disgusting that a hard working respectful and caring person such as my self has to put up with chavy nobs nicking my stuff
1446540 i blame that bloody gordon brown for this when im prime minister im going to bring in sharia law and then well see if these thiefs can ride off with my stuff when theyve had their hands cut off
1446541 thefts in this area are relatively unknown and we no nothing about them its a shame his bike was stolen as he will now have to carry his edition of political opposition for dummies that he just bought
1446542 wake up dad theres a man outside who wants to talk to you
1446543 in the back yard playing with the dog the movers called and said they wouldnt be here until tomorrow
1446544 he started yelling your name he started yelling and they didnt hear him
1446545 they can do almost anything they want but they cant choose you dont know how to choose but you will
1446546 come take my hand and you will know how to choose
1446547 you can feel the grip but thats not important whats important is what you can barely sense that thing so slight you wonder if its real
1446548 can i go beyond what i see can i go further out
1446549 mom called its all over the news hundreds maybe thousands of people are dead
1446550 block has been earning almost 2 000 per day on the application quite a bit more than she was expecting to make
1446551 get ready to be stopped by women in the street your entire image will emanate increased size this is what you always needed to lead a happier more fulfilling life
1446552 type your name the number of inches you want to gain and the reason s you want to gain those inches in the blanks below and read the completed statement out loud to reinforce the commitment that will lead to your ultimate success
1446553 i john elder have decided i want to gain two inches in length and one inch in girth i felt modest ambition would minimise disappointment my reasons are vanity and im committed to a good penis pill system until i reach my desired gains
1446554 im 21 and measured from the pelvic bone the length of my penis is around 7
1446555 the curious thing about our society most of the time we pretend that the penis doesnt shrink
1446556 in fact the penis doesnt have a set flaccid size its actually meaningless to measure the size of the penis because it varies from minute to minute according to the temperature and ones state of mind the trouble is if you get anxious it only makes it smaller to the point where it can disappear in cases where anxiety spirals into a panic attack
1446557 there were people rushing through the streets holding their penises some of them using chopsticks
1446558 as soon as they hit the hospital and started to relax they came back to normal
1446559 it could come back again in our society if someone spread the right stories around
1446560 the short answer is that every man at some point in his life worries about the size of his penis
1446561 if we dont like our penis we wont enjoy sex for people with a pathological issue with penis size it will affect their sex life
1446562 karl and i are working with xplane to update the did you know video because it seems to resonate with folks were going to update some of the facts reframe some of the slides turn down some of the global alarmism and turn up the visual attractiveness several notches
1446563 im not alone in the view that free trade at all costs has harmed american workers
1446564 economists who insist that offshore outsourcing is just a routine extension of international trade are overlooking how major a transformation it will likely bring and how significant the consequences could be the governments and societies of the developed world must start preparing and fast
1446565 we need action on multiple fronts schools universities policymakers business people local communities
1446566 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1446567 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1446568 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1446569 fulfill its olympic bid commitments to increase access to information and expand freedom of the press
1446570 so over the next year she is going to develop a research project around the themes that come from survivors
1446571 to ensure that the voices of sexual abuse survivors are given their rightful prominence in work to prevent sexual violence and abuse
1446572 right now we are living in a time of great populism
1446573 i talked with my colleagues from sweden and finland we think the current president of the european union and the european commission should closely follow the developments and react if necessary
1446574 peacekeeping in these regions is a suitable undertaking for the european union
1446575 we have good relations with european countries with the european union but i do not accept integration into the union for the mediterranean
1446576 by introducing self extinguishing cigarettes at least 2 000 lives could be saved in the eu each year
1446577 a close collaborator of jean sarkozy contacted me to tell me that the families of jean sarkozy and his fianc e had been outraged and were contemplating a lawsuit

1446608 the opportunity provided by the macarthur foundation to partner with the institute of play is something that ultimately will have a huge impact on how k 12 school teachers and students collaborate in the classroom
1446609 smallab gets students and teachers up out of their seats and has the potential to reshape learning in the 21st century classroom
1446610 were incredibly excited about this opportunity to build on the amazing work that david has done with support from macarthur
1446611 our work is focused on the design of 21st century learning environments that support kids in challenge based interdisciplinary multi sensory forms of learning smallab is an incredibly good fit with these values we are eager to see where davids team our teachers students and game designers can take it together
1446612 all those who come to britain must play by the rules it is right that foreign students wanting to take advantage of our world class universities and colleges must meet strict criteria
1446613 by locking people to one identity with id cards alongside a tough new sponsorship system we will know exactly who is coming here to study and crack down on bogus colleges

1446639 some of my toughest competition will come from my own team
1446640 i think it will be 1 2 3 red white and blue on the podium
1446641 knowing that people are working hard to beat me it makes me want to work so hard to become unreachable and untouchable

1446651 whats with all the carrots what do they need such good eyesight for anyway
1446652 aunque los riesgos de crecimiento se mantienen los riesgos alcistas de la inflaci n son una gran preocupaci n para el comit
1446653 everyone who claims that they did nothing wrong is lying
1446654 i think all of our games with ireland will be on national tv throughout the country our guys are looking forward to it they deserve a trip like this
1446655 i think our key guys are going to play a lot of the minutes but im not going to wear them out over there
1446656 the last time i checked none of those games count toward our rpi but i think its a time to look at some things lineup wise experimentation some x and o things
1446657 the young guys are going to have every opportunity to make an impact on the coaching staff i think they are going to get a feel and we are going to get a feel for where they stand and maybe how they project not only this year but for the future
1446658 its almost like the season started because we dont go home in august
1446659 im sensitive to that because when we get back from ireland and start school i dont know if well do anything organized as a group until mid or late september because i just want to keep us fresh we really have to be careful about that
1446660 but its a chance to look at some different things with the practices and the games and also to enjoy the culture and do some things educationally
1446661 i dont need a friend who changes when i change and who nods when i nod my shadow does that much better
1446662 i love waiting for your flash to load ive got fuck all else to do
1446663 perfect mr wood do you know anything about the art of film production
1446664 then how bout when the policemen arrived in daylight but now its suddenly night
1446665 i cant talk about it right now just be my friend and hold me while i cry
1446666 violet behaved in a way that made us reconsider whether we wanted to lend her any credibility or associate with her
1446667 we invited different local companies to come in look at an exam room and design it and take ownership and make it look like their space
1446668 we had kids come into the art room who normally dont do art and they saw the canvas with the tennis shoes and said hey i want to do that
1446669 i love colors so i used almost every color that i had to paint with and its just real decorative
1446670 i just happened to go in there one day and they had a tennis shoe out and i decided to draw one out
1446671 they will do anything to be the first card in college students wallets they dont do credit checks they dont even know if students have income
1446672 students are poor so applying for a credit card with a 2 000 credit limit is like winning the lottery for us
1446673 so they end up getting between 4 10 credit cards without blinking an eye
1446674 restricting access to this form of credit would result in great financial hardship for most card holding college students and their families
1446675 you cannot sign up students who have no source of income
1446676 if you do parents or some co signer would have to guarantee that bill would be paid
1446677 i wouldnt be able to pay frat dues or pay for books
1446678 no one should get a credit card that has not demonstrated creditworthiness
1446679 the reason these kids are all getting the credit cards is because the credit card companies know that if the kids get into trouble their parents in all likelihood will bail them out
1446680 thieves are known to cut open hot water cylinders and remove copper lining which in turn causes water damage to properties
1446681 french soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis
1446682 could be the basis for potential charges against individuals or the state
1446683 the youngest daughter of a well born rancher tita has always known her destiny to remain single and care for her aging mother when she falls in love her mother quickly scotches the liaison and tyrannically dictates that titas sister rosaura must marry the luckless suitor pedro in her place but tita has one weapon left her cooking esquivel mischievously appropriates the techniques of magical realism to make titas contact with food sensual instinctual and often explosive forced to make the cake for her sisters wedding tita pours her emotions into the task each guest who samples a piece bursts into tears esquivel does a splendid job of describing the frustration love and hope expressed through the most domestic and feminine of arts family cooking
1446684 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1446685 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1446686 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable
1446687 i was watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbours drive
1446688 it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1446689 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1446690 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1446691 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1446692 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1446693 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature
1446694 well i can see you think youre awesome in every way your lack of humility humors me ill smite you for it at some point but lets take care of this ice cream problem first
1446695 yeah but keep the ice cream in the carton and throw it all away at once
1446696 these young ladies have not expressed any desire to be with their mother or her family
1446697 when you got the haka when you first turned up to the village it was something pretty special i wish every new zealander could experience it because it was very spine tingling and it makes you really proud to be a kiwi
1446698 it was an amazing experience rubbing shoulders with other athletes it brought home what it meant to be a new zealander as well and a new zealand athlete at the olympics
1446699 in all honesty i hadnt felt that in a long time not playing for new zealand it really brought home what it meant it made me and all the rest of the guys really proud to be a kiwi and just fired up to represent your country
1446700 you can talk until youre blue in the face but until you experience it its something pretty different
1446701 i presume a lot of the guys havent had that sort of experience yet i can talk to them all i want about it and tell them what to expect but its something pretty special once you see it for yourself
1446702 theyll experience it and theyll handle it for themselves these guys are pretty mature and theyre good football players you want to play in front of the biggest crowd possible
1446703 were so excited already just to get out on the field and get playing its been pretty awesome so far
1446704 i look in the mirror and i see grey hairs and feel a bit old so of course i feel a bit old when theres 19 and 20 year olds running around
1446705 to see the facts set out in the clear light of day
1446706 its great to have a player of coles quality coming into the program
1446707 the big thing for us is that as a junior he gives us a quarterback in each class now
1446708 ill be closer to home thats one reason i decided to come to western
1446709 but the big thing is ill have the opportunity to compete for a job ill have the opportunity to see the field thats all ive ever wanted
1446710 i think its tough at that position to come into fall camp and get playing time right away
1446711 but when i talked to him he said all he wanted was a chance to compete and we give everybody a chance to compete for a spot
1446712 its definitely something ive been thinking about for a while
1446713 her stats and records speak to one side of her contribution but the things that dont show up on the stat sheet speak volumes in other areas and that was what made our team so successful
1446714 it was a story book ending to a great career certainly it was one of the best performances in the history of a storied program
1446715 there has never been anyone more passionate about western golf than sean
1446716 hes been a leader on and off the golf course as well as in the classroom he exemplifies what a student athlete is about and should be about hes handled himself with an extreme amount of class throughout his career
1446717 they executed the race plan to a t the coxswains did an absolutely great job and everybody was very focused so thats basically all you can ask for theyre ready for sunday i wish that it was tomorrow
1446718 there was no need to tear their way down the course we just tried to establish a good rhythm and see what was happening with the other crews and then go from there they did their job and they were happy with their performance
1446719 i thought it might be a little tighter just because of how uc san diego looked at the pacific coast rowing championships they were only three seconds back there
1446720 our four has only been together for about a month so theyve had a couple of good weeks of training after the pcrcs and theyve really improved since then
1446721 weve raced here more than any other lake i think for the seniors its very nice to have our last run at a national championship here its very comforting to be here
1446722 regardless of the outcome its going to be a tearful end
1446723 we had our last practice at home on tuesday and there were a few tears this weekend is going to be the end of a big part of our lives
1446724 in division ii we dont have to go 6 minutes and 20 seconds to win the national championship
1446725 weve got to be faster than everybody else but 6 35 to 6 40 will do it i dont have to go out and recruit olympic caliber athletes so we can take some of the athletes around campus and put together fast enough speed that doesnt work at other programs
1446726 every year our expectations change a little bit the pressure changes a little bit and the competition changes
1446727 i know that if i was coaching the other team i would tell my rowers they are going to have to take it away from us if they want to win
1446728 we havent raced against any of the schools from the east so we really dont know what to expect from them
1446729 that can be the scariest thing we have no way of knowing what they can do
1446730 its pretty impressive to accomplish what theyve accomplished this year and for those seniors to finish out their careers like that i cant even fathom what theyre feeling right now
1446731 theyre the perfect example of what a student athlete is they represent all that is great about it
1446732 i think just the fact that the seniors started this whole thing when they were freshmen they won the first one and for them to finish off their careers by winning the fourth one and not having a lot of overlap it was like the circle was completed
1446733 they executed the race plan which was to have a good start and then just execute stroke after stroke try and take a little bit more and keep pushing and pushing
1446734 they didnt let up and pushed all the way down the course
1446735 they got off the line quick didnt make any mistakes and just went to work and outrowed everybody
1446736 i think both of them eight and four are actually the fastest with the depth we had i think this is the best squad weve had
1446737 it was just a fun year watching them win like that theyre just amazing athletes
1446738 tomy omnibot 2000 robot at a nationwide contest sponsored by milo
1446739 respectively yeah my most embarrassing and proudest moment at the same time
1446740 google transalations can transalate an english wiki to a foreign language wiki only problem is javascript with html is required
1446741 in the ninth inning with two men on base and the royals leading 4 2 ortiz grounded out against kansas city closer joakim soria he said afterward that he felt a click in his left wrist early in the at bat the herald reported
1446742 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1446743 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1446744 if you click on the link you get a window that shows the progress of an automatic download of a so called new version of adobe flash which is supposedly required to watch the video you end up with a file labeled adobe flash its a fake on your machine a technique that is currently very popular
1446745 once weve gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1446746 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do
1446747 national is being absolutely up front about the policies it intends to implement should it become the government after the election
1446748 i refuse to be distracted by our opponents use of dirty tricks like secret recordings and labours attempts to sneak activists into our conference
1446749 our people are working extremely hard and at the same time were getting district wide overall progress but it just has to be faster
1446750 we had days we cried and we had days we prayed together but we are a family and we support each other
1446751 we held everybodys feet to the fire we realize we have a way to go but were doing alright
1446752 a fourth battalion relieves some of the stress our soldiers and families face by providing more dwell time at home station between deployments
1446753 part of the concern is our role is not going to diminish in iraq and afghanistan
1446754 pretty much everything weve asked him to do on and off the field
1446755 when hartline was trying to get everybody together and somebody would get mad at him and say
1446756 just because someone is a player at this position or that position and perceived to be maybe more important than somebody else those rules still apply to them
1446757 and i think its critically important for us moving forward that unfortunately sometimes those ideals have to be re enforced to young people
1446758 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1446759 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1446760 documents describing the creation of explosives as well as excerpts from the anarchists arsenal
1446761 siddiquis papers included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
1446762 may the blood of unintelligible be directly on your unintelligible possibly head or hands
1446763 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1446764 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own
1446765 the challenges are greater and exceed irans ability to reply
1446766 right now the future of iraq whether in fact iraq is able to be able to fulfill its whether we the united states are able to fulfill our objectives in iraq rests not really on what the iraqis do but mostly on what we the united states do
1446767 the future of the u s military presence in iraq
1446768 the most prominent dividing line in iraqi politics now is between the powers that be and the powers that arent
1446769 the powers that be spent much of the 1980s and 1990s in open opposition to saddam
1446770 which would make the system more inclusive and give the powers that arent and the popular forces they represent an opportunity for a share of the power
1446771 right now the future of iraq whether in fact iraq is able to be able to fulfill its whether we the united states are able to fulfill our objectives in iraq rests not really on what the iraqis do but mostly on what we the united states do
1446772 the future of the u s military presence in iraq
1446773 we hope the sides will manage to find compromise decisions that will promote the removal of tensions in the region
1446774 if events develop in the worst possible way with the use of force russia will not be able to stand by seeing as russian citizens live in south ossetia
1446775 i had the opportunity to spend some time testing and evaluating this motherboard with two sets of cpus and two types of memory
1446776 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1446777 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1446778 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1446779 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1446780 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1446781 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale
1446782 i do not know why people are in such a hurry to see me in prison
1446783 i am a strong man i went through youth hardships no one can intimidate me
1446784 if the judge rules against him in september the appeal process could drag for at least a year or two well after the election
1446785 with the help of the united nations we reached a new phrasing for article 24 which was agreed by the kurds and accepted by some of the other mps
1446786 we were surprised by the objections of some other members
1446787 kurds are for the distribution of authority in kirkuk but not equally dividing it
1446788 the division of power should come from the election results
1446789 if we want to reach a convincing result concerning kirkuk this might take a long time and affect the elections
1446790 so we said lets not cripple the country altogether and let the elections go ahead in all provinces while postponing them in kirkuk until consultations are completed
1446791 right now the future of iraq whether in fact iraq is able to be able to fulfill its whether we the united states are able to fulfill our objectives in iraq rests not really on what the iraqis do but mostly on what we the united states do
1446792 the future of the u s military presence in iraq
1446793 right now the future of iraq whether in fact iraq is able to be able to fulfill its whether we the united states are able to fulfill our objectives in iraq rests not really on what the iraqis do but mostly on what we the united states do
1446794 the future of the u s military presence in iraq
1446795 sunnis feared the future shiites feared the past and the kurds feared both
1446796 inside your hyperlink for the arnio ball chair usernames can only contain letters and numbers

1446819 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1446820 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1446821 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1446822 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1446823 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1446824 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it

1446832 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1446833 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1446834 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1446835 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1446836 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1446837 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indication of inflation expectations have been elevated
1446838 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1446839 over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1446840 the closest ive ever come to such a spontaneous divine experience involved my life force energy shooting up from the base of my spine during an orgasm it happened when i was with my ex lover and i found myself blissfully lost in a purplish turned white light that went beyond my body
1446841 after all evolutionary argument argues that men are supposed to be promiscuous thats what allows them to spread their seed in their effort to guarantee the success of the human race

1446849 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1446850 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1446851 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable

1446854 hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1446855 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades
1446856 it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1446857 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1446858 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1446859 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1446860 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1446861 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1446862 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1446863 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1446864 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1446865 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1446866 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1446867 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1446868 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1446869 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1446870 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1446871 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1446872 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1446873 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1446874 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1446875 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1446876 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1446877 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1446878 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1446879 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1446880 while there may be some who will protest i think you need to look at whats happening on the supermarket shelves
1446881 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1446882 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1446883 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1446884 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1446885 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1446886 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1446887 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1446888 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1446889 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1446890 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children
1446891 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1446892 what was given to solana was the telephone conversation transcript and not a response to the proposed package
1446893 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1446894 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1446895 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1446896 it has only been 20 days since our last press release and during that time ks media has added 72 more ktv clubs and 3 370 more screens up from the 257 ktv clubs and 9 777 screens announced on july 11 2008 given this strong adoption rate the company is confident it will reach more ktvs in what the company believes to be economically vibrant cities across china

1446926 sonys wondering how they ceded the online music space to apple so quickly apple has shown that you have to create a seamless experience between music stores and the devices that consumers use
1446927 if youre a big company like sony which has devices like the playstation integrating that content with your available devices whether its game consoles or the new internet connected tvs theyve been selling can be very compelling
1446928 itll be interesting to see how the relationships between the music labels under sonys control and apple and other music device makers play out
1446929 labels are in the business of selling licenses and intellectual property to anyone creating revenue generating distribution opportunities itll be interesting to see how these manufacturers react

1447021 what a disgrace that was to the entire organization and to aaron rodgers that gm thompson should have spread malicious propoganda enticing the city of green bay to hate favre that and of course blast favre with ad homynym attacks

1447027 weve not found any invasive or non native species here today and thats all to the good i hope it stays that way
1447028 these gods you worship received their power form the god i worship a god who chooses not to stand at a distance and punish or judge but who comes closer than you could ever believe and invites you and me into a personal relationship with him saying all i want is that you love me with all of your life and you love other people

1447046 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1447047 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1447048 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1447049 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1447050 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1447051 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1447052 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1447053 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1447054 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1447055 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1447056 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1447057 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1447058 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1447059 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1447060 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1447061 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1447062 digital revenue is up a whopping 100 6 percent during the period to 2 8 million uk titles up 145 4 percent scottish up 34 8 percent
1447063 to imagine this from a russian perspective you would now have a georgia inside nato
1447064 and georgia borders unto chechnya and it is very hard to think of a more sensitive issue for russians than chechnya and now you would have nato membership right on its doorstep in the north caucasus
1447065 so this is caught up with that it is also caught up now with president medvedevs desire to show a more strident russian foreign policy a more prestige seeking policy this would be a huge blow to his regime if nato could move this close into what are considered vital russian national interests
1447066 after the rose revolution four years ago georgia has truly been the country in the former soviet bloc after the baltic states in the early 1990s to thoroughly remake their country to reform and to install a democratic government that is a functioning independent state although there is of course a long way to go before georgia consolidates its democracy
1447067 it has made tremendous progress and has become a model and a symbol of what can actually be achieved in anti corruption and democracy building and russia doesnt like that but for the west of course if georgia fails if georgia is allowed to fall this means that any hopes that we may have of democracy building in this part of the world in this south eastern corner of europe is going to fail
1447068 its a corridor a very important corridor for oil from the caspian region going to the black sea and the mediterranean through turkey
1447069 so its now an area that has become economically important as well
1447070 across the region from ukraine over the caucasus to central asia there is no country in which the united states has invested so much of its prestige as in georgia which means that if suddenly georgia is allowed to fail and if the united states does not stand up for georgia and georgias integrity and security every government from kiev to tashkent will draw the conclusion that the united states is not a serious partner and in that sense for a very long time it will undermine u s interests in the whole of eurasia
1447071 theres no question heath ledgers performance has made cinematic history its one of the most important or memorable villains ever

1447080 for some of the 11 4 million uninsured americans with serious chronic conditions access to care seems to be unobtainable many may face early disability and death as a result
1447081 it will not be sufficient unless it is coupled with quality improvement efforts targeting the reasons that vulnerable populations with access to care often do not receive optimal care

1447166 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1447167 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1447168 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1447169 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1447170 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1447171 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1447172 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1447173 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1447174 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1447175 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1447176 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time

1447240 no one can simply order up innovation on demand wish as you might the innovation fairy wont sprinkle pixie dust on your newsroom while you sleep but you can encourage innovation nurture it by lowering barriers supporting those employees with entrepreneurial drive and providing a fertile environment for their ideas

1447273 the court is contemplating granting a new trial for a different reason on the grounds that the court committed a manifest error of law when in jury instruction no 15 it instructed the jury that t he act of making copyrighted sound recordings available for electronic distribution on a peer to peer network without license from the copyright owners violates the copyright owners exclusive right of distribution regardless of whether actual distribution has been shown
1447274 because the transfer of files occurs in a direct connection between the distributors computer and the recipients there is currently no way to capture the transfer as it happens
1447275 requiring proof of actual transfers would cripple efforts to enforce copyright owners rights online and would solely benefit those who seek to freeload off plaintiffs investment

1447472 thats what he talked about yesterday i want to drill here
1447473 i dont know where he was standing i think he was in a building somewhere this plan will not lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration
1447474 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1447475 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet we have to end the age of oil
1447476 a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
1447477 theres a real irony when it comes to offshore drilling its done so we can get more oil in the hopes of reducing gas prices in the meantime we keep burning fossil fuels which causes more global warming which leads to more hurricanes which lead to more oil lost in spills and yet drilling does almost nothing to alleviate the cost of gasoline
1447478 government studies have indicated that it will take a decade for any offshore drilling to pay off even minimally and even then prices will only be reduced by a few cents per gallon
1447479 important to recognise if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for 10 years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
1447480 why on earth would i do that when im doing so well with postcards postcards are where its at

1447497 i have never consciously aspired for bollywood but wanted to do just enough for people to recognize my voice my guitar and eventually my compositions
1447498 come to think of it i was always keen to go on stage even as a kid when my mother released her first album of ghazals in london i went up on stage and sang an old kishore kumar favorite mere dil mein aaj kya hai going up on stage as often as i was urged to during community functions and such didnt bother me at all
1447499 a r is very definite about his ideas and vision but at the same time gives the artist freedom along a given framework he has always welcomed my musical ideas and individuality such as on some of the guitar vamps on kabhi kabhi aditi
1447500 i was not nervous about singing since i have been doing it for a while but each time i feel conscientious about putting in the right feel and expression for the song which the listener should sense i was excited about all three songs what i like is that all three of them have different emotions that are conveyed to the listener

1447510 frequent executions dull the sensibilities toward the taking of life this makes it easier for men to kill and increases murders which in turn increase murders and so on around the vicious circle
1447511 the thing that keeps one from killing is the emotion they have against it and the greater the sanctity that the state pays to life the greater the feeling of sanctity the individual has for life

1447549 the area off the coast of an island that a nation may use is called the exclusive economic zone the group in charge of defining that is the state department so the president and congress can say the off shore areas are opened up but still not recognize these quarter of a million square miles available for american oil exploration
1447550 the issues involve not only state sovereignty over vital territories but also significant national defense concerns and substantial economic losses over fisheries and petroleum
1447551 its totally anti public anti congress anti state actions but unfortunately the state department thinks it has the power to adopt this boundary line with the russians without anybodys consent outside themselves
1447552 the state department is basically chopping off a piece of alaska and giving it to a foreign government without alaska having any say in it
1447553 which means it can be changed with the stroke of a pen by the president because it has no force of law
1447554 its just a matter of finding sympathetic people in washington and the other states to go for it theres plenty of organizations who have endorsed our efforts so we keep up the drumbeat

1447571 i am overwhelmed but i believe god will give me a safe delivery because i have faith in him
1447572 for us its a crisis situation and it is unacceptable
1447573 our anxiety about the existing situation stems from our desire to meet the millennium development goal mdg by the 2015 deadline
1447574 for ghana this means reducing maternal mortality by three quarters to 54 deaths per 100 000 births
1447575 the paradox is that we know what is killing them
1447576 most pregnant women cannot afford the cost of delivery if they can especially in the rural areas they are faced with no health centres close by and even where there are there are no qualified personnel
1447577 if you cannot afford you will certainly risk delivering at the hands of an unprofessional and pay a few dollars but then you might die
1447578 its not surprising that bleeding is the second leading course of maternal mortality
1447579 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
1447580 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
1447581 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1447582 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
1447583 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
1447584 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
1447585 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
1447586 pakistani military leaders rubbished the american information and evidence on the kabul bombing but provided some rationale for keeping a window open with haqqani just as the british government had decided to open talks with some taliban leaders in southern afghanistan last year
1447587 the discovery of lake deposits with perfectly preserved fossils of mosses diatoms and minute crustacea called ostracods is particularly exciting

1447589 so wait you mean to tell me that climate change is cyclical
1447590 previously the warmest year of the century was 1998 when a strong el nino a warm water event in the eastern pacific ocean added warmth to global temperatures
1447591 well not really earth just the species that happen to inhabit it at the time
1447592 oh so you wanna just keep me up huh well im just gonna have to fry you like bacon to grow my new jungle at the bottom of the planet
1447593 an abrupt and dramatic climate cooling of 8 c in 200 000 years forced the extinction of tundra plants and insects and brought interior antarctica into a perpetual deep freeze from which it has never emerged though may do again as a result of climate change
1447594 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived

1447612 search engines can easily set up an algorithm to measure relevance according to certain on page criteria ranking quality on the other hand is much more difficult due to its subjective nature the search engines bots just dont have that kind of intelligence yet however in order to stay competitive and produce income search engines must deliver quality search results so the number of in pointing links from credible similarly themed sites plus other types of human reaction to the content of a site become important gauges of quality

1447637 the truth is simple it only becomes complicated when we deviate from it
1447638 like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand that are on the seashore
1447639 and now if you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples because the whole earth belongs to me and you yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words that you are to say to the sons of israel
1447640 didnt jehovah promised that nations will bless themselves by means of this seed
1447641 and i will conclude with the house of israel and with the house of judah a new covenant not one like the covenant that i concluded with their forefathers in the day of my taking hold of their hand to bring them forth out of the land of egypt which covenant of mine they themselves broke although i myself had husbandly ownership of them is the utterance of jehovah
1447642 for this is the covenant that i shall conclude with the house of israel after those days
1447643 i will put my law within them and in their heart i shall write it and i will become their god and they themselves will become my people
1447644 and they will no more teach each one his companion and each one his brother saying know jehovah for they will all of them know me from the least one of them even to the greatest one of them
1447645 for i shall forgive their error and their sin i shall remember no more
1447646 and he sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the public service likewise with the blood yes nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the law
1447647 is it possible to receive benefits of an agreement that im not a part of
1447648 this very tent is an illustration for the appointed time that is now here and in keeping with it both gifts and sacrifices are offered however when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come to pass through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation
1447649 royal priesthood aarons priestly lineage foreshadowed 1 peter 2 9 however the point is that jehovahs covenant with the priesthood did not supplant or otherwise invalidate the covenant jehovah had made with the entire nation of israel at that time likewise the covenant for a kingdom jesus had made with his anointed followers will not supplant or restrict the covenant jesus instituted on behalf of all faithful mankind this is evident because those with the earthly hope seen in revelation the great crowd have washed their robes in the blood of the lamb jesus states that his blood represents the new covenant which is to be poured out in your behalf
1447650 also he took a loaf gave thanks broke it and gave it to them saying
1447651 this cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood which is to be poured out in your behalf
1447652 however you are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials and i make a covenant with you just as my father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of israel

1447716 i remember the big third down we had before that the one across the middle i got hit pretty hard
1447717 it was just a tough route that we had to get and then the third and 11 i was so tired out there i remember we repped that a lot in practice so it was kind of routine for me and luckily i was able to take a couple of steps up the field and we got that first down
1447718 it had just been sore so we were better off being safe and seeing whats going on it was pretty much nothing now we know and we can move on
1447719 thats why ive been sweating and all this stuff to play a game against a different team

1447744 we are in the process of investigating the submitted documentation on the predators alexander radulov and the five other players whose contracts are in dispute
1447745 it is our ambition to have something to communicate in mid august
1447746 we continue to expect the khl and the russian ice hockey federation to take a position and refuse to aid and abet a blatant breach of contract which through their inaction to date they have now become party to
1447747 as of tuesday my understanding is that the russians had not yet submitted any documentation to the iihf for the investigation draw your own conclusions

1447762 crime reduction is nice but its cyclical it happens regardless of who is mayor generally due to economic conditions the crime reduction of the late 90s will likely get attributed to economys upbeat and being that it is the only real accomplishment of the giuliani administration he will likely not be viewed as much of a significant mayor

1447773 non jews living under jewish law in eretz yisrael land of israel must either be enslaved as water carriers and wood hewers or banished or exterminated
1447774 the difference between a jewish soul and souls of non jews all of them in all different levels is greater and deeper than the difference between a human soul and the soul of cattle
1447775 so much so that the world was created solely for the sake of jews
1447776 the majesty of israel and the question of the diaspora
1447777 there is no such thing as enemy civilians in war time
1447778 the law of our torah is to have mercy on our soldiers and to save them this is the real moral behind israels torah and we must not feel guilty due to foreign morals
1447779 a thousand non jewish lives are not worth a jews fingernail
1447780 is considered among the most learned sages of the torah
1447781 it is impossible to mix the pure with the impure they the arabs are a blight a devil a disaster the arabs are donkeys and we have to ask ourselves why god didnt create them to walk on all four well the answer is that they are needed to build and clean they dont have any place in our school
1447782 if they dont stop after we kill 100 then we must kill a thousand and if they dont stop after 1 000 then we must kill 10 000 if they still dont stop we must kill 100 000 even a million whatever it takes to make them stop
1447783 what is hateful to yourself dont do to your fellow human being that is the whole of the torah and the rest is commentary
1447784 we had a helicopter that took infrared imagery yesterday and it is still showing a few very isolated hot spots mostly well in the interior of the fire that we dont consider any kind of a threat at this point
1447785 confirms beyond the shadow of a doubt that the logic of the state is not contradictory to that of the resistance
1447786 the resistance will be the spearhead of lebanons strength and this resistance will work according to what we agree upon regarding the defensive strategy
1447787 we will bear our full responsibilities and we will not relinquish them for the benefit of the israeli enemy
1447788 we must remain strong in confronting israel and reject any weakness position
1447789 we will reject any step that would aim at thwarting our strength and welcome any process that would consolidate it
1447790 any force that would yield to confront israel will receive our support
1447791 the primary and fundamental duty of the government after the policy statement was to be concerned
1447792 and the different problems from which the people are suffering
1447793 hezbollah may be surprised with just how ready we are to handle whatever it has in stored
1447794 the process the idf had undergone since the end of the war mainly that of training and combat readiness positions us in a different place that we were two years ago
1447795 i dont thing hezbollah would be a match for us and the armor corps is a key player in this it is the heart and soul of military maneuvering and it has some of the most advanced weapons available at its disposal
1447796 im not surprised tanks are the f 16 of the goc headquarters these days if you put a pilot in a tank he might get lost among all the technical equipment
1447797 brigade 71 is doing outstanding work obviously the idfs main goal is operational but as long as we are needed for other security details we will perform them to the best of our ability is policing what we strive for no i would be happier if we could carry out more missions as we do in the gaza strip
1447798 however the most important request that israel has made and was discussed by israeli and peacekeeping officers is related to practical measures by unifil to prevent the capture by hezbollah fighters of israeli crew members of warplanes that hezbollah might succeed in knocking down
1447799 in case an israeli warplane was shot down in unifils area of influence the pilot should be rescued as soon as possible and taken to the closest unifil post before any side manages to reach him
1447800 in case the pilot fell into the hands of gunmen he also must be rescued grazzianos order added
1447801 only in the case that the pilot falls into the hands of lebanese army troops there should be no intervention
1447802 hezbollah does not want to risk an israeli counterstrike but on the other hand it is growing stronger
1447803 for this reason israeli aircraft may be a suitable target
1447804 unfounded allegations made on 5 august 2008 in the daily al akhbar regarding unifils force commander issuing an order at the behest of the israeli defense forces
1447805 this media report does not accurately represent the way unifil operates
1447806 and are carried out in close cooperation and coordination with the lebanese army which has primary responsibility for security and law and order in the area of operations
1447807 in accordance with the technical arrangements established in 2006 between unifil and the lebanese army unifil will hand over to the lebanese army any persons whom they may detain and any weapons ammunitions and explosives they may seize in the course of discharging their duties under the mandate of the security council resolution 1701 2006 and in accordance with unifil rules of engagement
1447808 the increase of israeli enemy violations of lebanese airspace water and land is considered an unacceptable provocative escalation
1447809 it requires condemnation and serious action by the lebanese authorities and the united nations
1447810 i dont understand who would carry out the defense responsibility if they practiced reservations
1447811 the nations sovereignty cannot be violated by its resistance but by a foreign army
1447812 anyone discussing modernizing the army should realize how much it would cost to have the capacity to fight an army like israels
1447813 our people kaweahs are mad and we are trying to hold our warriors back from causing trouble in oatman and against the mohave county sheriffs department before you know it the mojaves and hualapais will get into the act it will make wounded knee look like and sic sunday school picnic
1447814 well miles he gets pentalities from the opposing corner for us
1447815 our voters are intrigued by our new top 2 system of voting which once again allows them to pick their favorite candidate for each office without regard to party this should be very popular its the washington tradition to vote for the person not the party even though there are not a lot of hotly contested primaries we believe the level of interest is very high in this presidential and gubernatorial election year and that we will get a good turnout

1447823 the resistance victory over israel in the 33 day war revealed that the vision of a powerful israel was an illusion created by the global arrogance the us and its allies
1447824 today for the first time since the creation of the israeli regime the enemy is surrounded by deep crises devastating crises that have foiled its strategies and it cannot find a way out of them
1447825 kept their desperate efforts to replace the concept of victory in lebanon with the permanent dominance of israel

1447834 the bush administrations latest plan for saving the northern spotted owl from extinction while allowing a boost in old growth logging was better but still not good enough according to three leading professional organizations of wildlife scientists
1447835 given that the northern spotted owl has been experiencing about a 4 percent annual rate of population decline for the last 15 years any reductions from current levels of habitat protection cannot be justified

1447846 if they dont qualify for regular then they can apply for the disaster unemployment

1447850 these buildings really took a hit during the floods because they are situated on clear and biscuit creeks
1447851 youve got to get out of here it doesnt look as if you can rebuild here right
1447852 unfortunately fema will only provide funding to rebuild these buildings to their pre flood state not to rebuild elsewhere
1447853 in the meantime all we can do is wait for the insurance money federal funding and make do with what have so we can keep our buses running

1447956 if texas doesnt dramatically not slightly or moderately but dramatically improve its education outcomes texas will fall behind in terms of economic competitiveness with other states and with other countries

1447987 acredito que prestei todos os esclarecimentos necess rios cabe agora ao procurador do coni seguir adiante com as investiga es e chegar verdade
1447988 it doesnt seem to be what we are looking for
1447989 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected also protect the dharmi to protect dharma and remember hindu vote is sacred never barter it away this should be our refrain campaign all over india at this critical juncture we should demand follow up action on the historic the vhp gave a call to the people to wage a dharmyudh holy war against jihad at the gujarat sant margdarshak samelan on sunday blaming the previous governments for showing a lack of political will to curb the ever increasing menace ofterrorism in india top vhp leaders announced to wage a mahabharat it is dharma yuddha it is the jvalamukhi of hindu akrosh let sonia go back to luciana let empress chamchas leave office let temporary art 370 be abrogated by a presidential proclamation chamchas dont play with fire amarnath means immortal paramatman he is the embodiment of images can have a profound impact and make a lasting impression even on the most cynical among us they can also act as a force multiplier in a conflict zone recall the photographs and television footage of teenaged palestinian boys in gaza and the west bank confronting israeli tanks armed with no more than shepherds slings of young men their faces half covered with handkerchiefs and kafiyeh racing through billowing clouds of tear gas to hurl stones at soldiers armed with assault rifles of middle aged and old women violating police pickets and defying curfew that was the first time we heard of a little used arabic word intifada which literally means to shake off but in recent times has come to mean a rebellion premised on the biblical tale of david vanquishing goliath a relentless mass protest born of festering anger deep seated grievance and overwhelming uncontrollable rage kanals of land to the sri amarnath shrine board the land was meant for creating temporary facilities for pilgrims who trek to the amarnath shrine every year braving inclement weather and jihadi attacks this time its a hindu intifada an outpouring of pent up anger which has brought life in jammu and other towns and villages in the province to a standstill intifada more tellingly the tactics that have been adopted by the protesters are those that have often brought kashmir valley to a standstill if you look at the photographs of the hindu intifada you will get a sense of how jammu has decided to give kashmir a taste of its own medicine in this case it is dum dum yatra thus making the pilgrimage to the amarnath shrine subordinate to the valleys muslims ber alle politics and delhis equally odious politics of muslim appeasement bandh in recent years
1447990 there is a great deal of anger among the people of jammu even the army seems to be unable to contain the anger of the people
1447991 the government should realise that this is not going to end and while we have appealed for peace the government and administration need to take some real steps to address the issues raised in jammu
1447992 if governments continuously fail to protect indian people then the people will wage a dharmyudh against jihadi terrorism hindus would go to kashmir from gujarat to respond
1447993 we are not born to be killed by muslim terrorists
1447994 omar abdullah or mehbooba mufti cannot decide as to when and how the hindus can go on the amarnath yatra kashmir is a part of india any effort to stop hindus from going on amarnath pilgrimage would meet with a strong public reaction
1447995 madrasas are like dogs infected with rabies it affects the society there should be an immediate ban on the functioning of these madrasas
1447996 to avoid riots in ahmedabad incidents like the one at godhra must be stopped
1447997 if osama bin laden or pervez musharaff want to plant a bomb in ahmedabad they cannot do so without local help no wonder a section of the local muslims are extending a helping hand to the terrorist outfits without it ahmedabad bangalore or jaipur serial blasts would not have been possible
1447998 every state should have a special cell to handle terrorism these cell should be given military like powers to curb terrorism
1447999 never had swami felt such a spiritual exaltation so saturated had he become with the presence of the great god that for days after he could speak of nothing else shiv was all in all shiv the eternal one the great monk rapt in meditation aloof from the world

1448012 id leave here id be tired wed play games before the game id be dead tired so its just nice to feel normal again
1448013 i came undrafted off the street nobody thought i could play
1448014 so for me to go in and accomplish a little bit my first year and to come back more hungry and wanting it a lot more i feel is the mindset that i need to have right now theres no way no how that i can get complacent
1448015 you tell me a team that has a much better cast than that
1448016 when doctors take a look at the knee they dont understand how he can play
1448017 ive never taken a whipping like i did last year and that kind of pissed me off
1448018 a group of wide receivers whom he has as much as proclaimed the best in the league
1448019 i dont want to play like a rookie i dont want to seem like a rookie at all im out here with veterans and when im on the field they dont expect me to play like a rookie im setting the bar high for myself and im looking for big things this year
1448020 royal is very consistent hes going to be a starter in this league a long time
1448021 it means a lot that they have confidence in me
1448022 this game is built by how good your front is
1448023 i dont care how good your back end is those guys make everything happen
1448024 i knew hed be good but hes much better than i anticipated as a rookie both mentally and physically hes been pretty impressve

1448037 the race for women is not deiced yet though they are giving obama a solid lead
1448038 the womens vote is obamas to consolidate the way to definitively put this election away is to take the vote that he has substantially already and put it over 50 percent
1448039 the majority of women voters polled say gender does not matter
1448040 obamas selection of a woman running mate makes no difference to 55 of women voters and mccains selection of a woman as his 2 makes no difference to 62 however obama would benefit twice as much as mccain from offering the second slot to a woman 29 of females are more likely to support obama if he picks a woman vs 15 who would be more likely to support mccain

1448043 there have been rumblings out of panthers camp that club officials are fed up with smiths actions not just the latest incident and are at least considering the idea of dealing him to another team the idea of trading one of the best receivers in football seems far fetched but smith has become a divisive force on the team one panthers source said that several defensive backs were walking around after the recent incident saying that if management didnt discipline smith they would this isnt exactly the best way to begin a season all that to say that i know an owner in the nfc east who has spent the last four months coveting another star wide receiver cowboys owner jerry jones struckout with chad johnson the lions roy williams and anquan boldin but behind closed doors hes still pining away for someone to play opposite terrell owens

1448082 organize yourselves prepare every needful thing and establish a house even a house of prayer a house of fasting a house of faith a house of learning a house of glory a house of order a house of god
1448083 know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you
1448084 remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of god
1448085 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest
1448086 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls

1448088 how can i find my way except some man should guide me
1448089 be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity
1448090 i think that helped us through because we tried to help each other and not say unkind words to each other
1448091 foul talk defiles the man who speaks it if you have the habit how do you break it you begin by making a decision to change the next time you are prone to use words you know to be wrong simply stop keep quiet or say what you have to say in a different way
1448092 one of the reasons why so few people are to be found who seem sensible and pleasant in conversation is that almost everybody is thinking about what he wants to say himself rather than about answering clearly what is said to him
1448093 charity is the pure love of christ and it endureth forever
1448094 no president no dont send that its cold and you need your coat

1448096 all of you who are catholics you meet in camp decatur forward march and dont come back until three

1448098 the rest of you protestants meet in the theaters in camp farragut forward march and dont come back until three oclock
1448099 monson youre not catholic youre not jewish youre not a protestant
1448100 well go and find somewhere to meet and dont come back until three oclock
1448101 the recognition of power higher than man himself does not in any sense debase him if in his faith he ascribes beneficence and high purpose to the power which is superior to himself he envisions a higher destiny and nobler attributes for his kind and is stimulated and encouraged in the struggle of existence he must seek believing praying and hoping that he will find no such sincere prayerful effort will go unrequited that is the very constitution of the philosophy of faith
1448102 give me a light that i may tread safely into the unknown
1448103 go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of god that shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way
1448104 who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place
1448105 he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully
1448106 he shall receive the blessing from the lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation
1448107 the safety of our nation depends upon the purity and strength of the home and i thank god for the teachings of the church in relation to home building and the impression that kind parents have made that the home must be the most sacred place in the world our people are home builders and they are taught everywhere from childhood to old age that the home should be kept pure and safe from the evils of the world
1448108 we are witnesses today of the prompting of the spirit this vast throng reflects not only individual feelings but also the gratitude of god for a life well lived

1448110 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1448111 my view has been all long and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time
1448112 inflation has been high spurred by earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1448113 we are seeing strong interest emerge from the trucking industry
1448114 for the first time we may this year see trucking applications emerge as our largest market
1448115 we have seen a tremendous change in the market interest in our truck products over the past few months as the price of oil has shown such surprising volatility
1448116 we need to move faster and find ways to encourage all of our partners and suppliers to plan for faster growth as we turn this initial interest into hard orders
1448117 it would be nice to see the rubber hit the road when it comes to the lng truck systems
1448118 considering the current economic conditions in north america we are pleased with the general performance of the company during this quarter
1448119 the continued improvement integration and reorganization programs put in place in 2007 should continue to improve our margins and our profitability during the next six months of 2008 we continue to seek expansion projects in canada as well as in the united states
1448120 even if it seems as though chinas economic demand run has slowed some those changes at the margins still make them a huge consumer of crude products

1448123 the results support further development of nimotuzumab in this setting and trials in metastatic colorectal cancer are high on the list of indications that ym and its licensees plan to develop
1448124 initially however ym will concentrate on those indications where nimotuzumab can complete pivotal trials in the shortest time within its available resources
1448125 because of compelling observations in phase 2 trials in those indications and because they require shorter development times than colorectal trials would require
1448126 while wed love to pursue colorectal cancer we cant handle it right now
1448127 now we are focused on areas that can drive us fastest to market with the highest confidence
1448128 these changes in staffing are the result of an aggressive concentration on the most rapid development of our two products in the international markets

1448145 so wait you mean to tell me that climate change is cyclical
1448146 previously the warmest year of the century was 1998 when a strong el nino a warm water event in the eastern pacific ocean added warmth to global temperatures
1448147 well not really earth just the species that happen to inhabit it at the time
1448148 oh so you wanna just keep me up huh well im just gonna have to fry you like bacon to grow my new jungle at the bottom of the planet
1448149 an abrupt and dramatic climate cooling of 8 c in 200 000 years forced the extinction of tundra plants and insects and brought interior antarctica into a perpetual deep freeze from which it has never emerged though may do again as a result of climate change
1448150 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1448151 yeah but maybe martians ate perchlorate and were mercury based
1448152 if you kiss a frog it will turn into a hooters girl

1448154 i find it comical that there is a picture of saturn even though the content has nothing to do with saturn at all it has to do with the aspect of life on mars not life on saturn for life on saturn is rather atrophied since saturn has constant hurricanes that would rip life forms like you and me into shreds in seconds
1448155 hear ye hear ye we have finally concluded that what we found on mars is wait for it chemicals

1448159 a few months ago i wrote that john mccain was an honorable man and he would run an honorable campaign
1448160 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
1448161 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1448162 it suggests you are not trying to solve problems all you are trying to do is divide people so you can win an election that is nothing to be proud of lets have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in peoples lives

1448190 but sometimes an adolescents musical tastes will reveal nothing the key to understanding any teenager is to treat them with respect by listening to what they have to say rather than typecasting them according to the type of music they listen to

1448205 amazing revelations have emerged concerning already existing government plans to overhaul the way the internet functions in order to apply much greater restrictions and control over the web

1448207 mr mccain had himself touted as the american president americans have been waiting for
1448208 the racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control

1448210 the paper came about after some major fire organizations formed a coalition in september 2006 to address concerns about the ongoing effort by ems advocacy groups to form a u s ems administration this would move ems responsibility from the agencies that currently have it into a single administration which we feel is unnecessary
1448211 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1448212 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1448213 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1448214 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1448215 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1448216 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
1448217 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man

1448226 happily never after how hollywood favors adultery and promiscuity over marital intimacy on prime time broadcast tv
1448227 suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner
1448228 the american people need to hold the networks and their broadcast affiliates accountable for pushing questionable content into their homes over publicly owned airwaves advertisers too must be held accountable for the messages they underwrite with their advertising dollars and the social cost of supporting those messages
1448229 pricing beyond commodity and energy cost increases to maintain operating margin would be very risky given the pressure that our consumers are under

1448239 when he came by himself or with just another companion often not it was just generally known it was charged back to simunovich fisheries or to entertainment or however the accounting system worked
1448240 we were told by our general manager or it would come through vaughn
1448241 i cant be specific but he has done it at least two times but often in a group situation
1448242 on both the first two occasions when winston peters was part of peter simunovichs party as best i recall peter simunovich signed the bill for the table and i charged it to his personal account
1448243 at the end of the meal winston peters thanked me and left the restaurant he did not offer to make any payment for the meal and he did not make any payment for the meal
1448244 um on average hed spend there would be 60 per head and thats just an average you know two courses a couple of glasses of wine and coffee
1448245 on certain occasions hed ask us to cash cheques for him as well which was not an ordinary thing we did for customers but it was done for winston

1448256 he said that one of the reasons he needed to fence off his property was that when he was living in switzerland
1448257 he was interrupted so much he couldnt get any work done
1448258 hed always been a fairly enigmatic person and him making a public appearance to the local townspeople that went a long way with the folks in town
1448259 when the news media found out he was in cavendish they just descended on the town to find out everything they could people wouldnt tell them anything
1448260 no matter how late it was he seemed to be working

1448263 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1448264 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1448265 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower
1448266 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1448267 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1448268 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico

1448286 the chief executive of the mortgage giant freddie mac rejected internal warnings that could have protected the company from some of the financial crises now engulfing it according to more than two dozen current and former high ranking executives and others that chief executive richard f syron in 2004 received a memo from freddie macs chief risk officer warning him that the firm was financing questionable loans that threatened its financial health today freddie mac and the nations other major mortgage finance company fannie mae are in such perilous condition that the federal government has readied a taxpayer financed bailout that could cost billions though the current housing crisis would have undoubtedly caused problems at both companies freddie mac insiders say mr syron heightened those perils by ignoring repeated recommendations
1448287 until the recent spike in gas prices much of the discussion about solving our transportation problems namely emissions from cars and dependence on foreign oil centered on increasing the efficiency of the vehicles we drive through higher cafe standards and new designs lately the discussion has expanded to include the importance of public transportation walkable cities and to a lesser extent cycling however even as alternatives to driving have become more prominent in public discourse the fact of the matter is that people get far more excited about the chevy volt and the tesla roadster than they do about hybrid electric buses and bicycle lanes shiny cars and solar panels get more attention in much the same way when it comes to solving our energy crisis there is always more enthusiasm for renewable energy technologies like wind and solar than there is for energy efficiency when it comes down to it fancy cars and shiny solar panels are just sexier than riding a bicycle and installing triple glazed windows at the same time cycling which is the most efficient form of transportation and energy efficiency are by far the cheapest means of addressing a wide range of issues from climate change to congestion to high energy prices
1448288 its always been difficult to define an eras trends without generalizing but nowadays its difficult to even define what a trend is
1448289 its safe to say the 80s were the age of the yuppie and the new romantic while the 90s were about grunge on the streets and minimalism on the catwalks but in these tight economic times designers and shops are desperate for customers so theyre offering up lots of mini trends within trends to appeal to as wide an audience as possible its hard to pin a season down to a single idea anymore

1448292 mccain made signifciant gains at obamas expense among some of what had been obamas strongest demographic groups
1448293 the survey results come as obama fresh off what had been characterized as a triumphant tour of the middle east and europe including a speech to 200 000 germans in berlin that trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive response ad by the mccain campaign that questioned whether obamas popularity around the world meant he was ready to lead the u s
1448294 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping

1448298 hes the fastest guy ive ever played with in the pros or in college
1448299 hopefully well play long enough to get rolling and get some momentum heading into next week
1448300 we probably need to play a little bit more than normal its a new offense and a new offensive line we just need to get out there and get our timing going
1448301 it might two series it might be four series you never really know it will be good to get out there against a different look and a different defense well gauge it off of that
1448302 i feel good about where were at its been a good camp were starting to click as an offense its a matter of carrying it over to a game now
1448303 we need to get out there and win a game wed like to put some points on the board early and let the other guys come in and finish it up
1448304 we are were ready for a different team and a different look it will be nice to face some guys who dont know every route were running it will be good to get out there and get bumped around a bit and get a few bumps and bruises
1448305 with rb jamaal charles hes the fastest guy ive ever played with in the pros or in college there arent a whole lot of guys who can bounce it out and outrun a corner and a safety hes got that kind of speed hes probably one of our best pass blockers he gets really excited when he picks up a blitz and he stalemates em he also runs between the tackles pretty well rb dantrell savage has had a great camp he reads holes very well theyve both had very good camps and it will be fun to watch them play
1448306 a lot until that changes i guess ill keep getting asked that question
1448307 of course last year at this time i was competing to get a starting job this year its a different kind of pressure last year i put pressure on myself to try to win the job this year people are looking at me to put us in the right plays and put the ball where its supposed to be theres always going to be pressure you just deal with it and play with it
1448308 the same way you approach pressure in a game know what youre doing and know what your teammates are supposed to be doing and get em in the right plays
1448309 hes been great even when i first got into the starting lineup last year he was always very positive when i came off the field never negative hell drop you some little hints if you see this guy do this you might have the dig on the backside stuff like that hes everything a young quarterback could ask for
1448310 i can tell a difference and everyone who knows me can damon obviously can its just different last year i was competing for a job this year im competing within myself when the team doesnt know who the quarterback is it makes it hard for them to believe in one guy we kind of ran into that last year when you know its your job and you know its up to you to win games you approach it differently
1448311 they told me that i was their guy right after the season theyve stayed true to that i dont have a reason not to believe them as soon as they told me that i started preparing that way it gives you an added sense of confidence when your front office and your coach believe in you now its just a matter of going out there and proving it
1448312 hopefully its more swim than sink he edwards obviously believes in me i just have to go out there and prove that he made the right decision
1448313 we have to go out there and play smart we cant turn the ball over play good defense run the ball and well be right there some folks arent giving us much of a shot but thats not always a bad place to start sometimes you can sneak up on people that way
1448314 were getting more of a feel for each other every day were seeing the game the same way and were seeing the same holes instead of waiting for him to get open im throwing it to an open spot because i know hell get there its starting to take shape that way were going to continue to work on it weve got a lot of years left together

1448320 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
1448321 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
1448322 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
1448323 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
1448324 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
1448325 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
1448326 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
1448327 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
1448328 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
1448329 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating

1448348 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1448359 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1448360 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1448406 die sorgen der w hrungsh ter sind dieselben wie bei der letzten sitzung am 25 juni
1448407 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1448408 por qu no se hace p blico el proyecto ejecutivo por qu no se realiz el estudio de impacto h drico y ambiental en todo este tiempo y por qu no se licitaron en forma simult nea las obras hidr ulicas
1448409 de la disputa p blica entre la contratista y vialidad provincial
1448410 estamos pr ximos a finalizar el relevamiento con los datos que nos est dando la municipalidad y el trabajo de nuestros t cnicos para consensuar con el ministerio de aguas el proyecto h drico en el tramo que corresponde a colastin
1448411 tiene liberado un importante tramo que es toda la zona de rinc n para llevar adelante la obra porque el proyecto ejecutivo ya est es decir que la paralizaci n de los trabajos es absoluta responsabilidad de la empresa nos piden el proyecto ejecutivo completo para todo el tramo lo cual deber an haberlo hecho antes de que se licite la obra como no exist a a contrarreloj hemos tenido que abocarnos a trabajar en eso
1448412 una obra que se licit tres veces hubiera merecido tener un proyecto ejecutivo que contemple el impacto h drico sobre todo en una zona tan particular como es sa y sin embargo no lo ten a
1448413 con las modificaciones que hemos llevado adelante solamente en el tramo de rinc n donde hemos incorporado cinco nuevas alcantarillas que no estaban contempladas se prolonga la traza alrededor de unos 200 metros esas peque as modificaciones que hemos introducido en ese tramo corto conllevan a una readecuaci n que supera los dos millones de pesos
1448414 debemos ir adecuando las modificaciones que se van realizando teniendo en cuenta que los valores que cotiza la empresa en las ampliaciones que se van a concretar superan largamente los valores cotizados en el presupuesto original estableciendo un nuevo cuadro de reajuste para ir logrando las variaciones presupuestarias
1448415 lo que falta ahora es que vialidad termine el proyecto ejecutivo vial teniendo en cuenta las observaciones h dricas que les hicimos para que luego la municipalidad el ministerio de aguas y el ina realicen todas las verificaciones necesarias para transportar el agua de un lado hacia el otro de la ruta y que llegue a destino final ese trabajo complementario de desag es pluviales en el que ya estamos trabajando no impide que se ejecute el proyecto ejecutivo vial si se tienen en cuenta las observaciones igualmente habr que destinarle otra partida presupuestaria y licitar la obra h drica
1448416 motivan este requerimiento las insistentes solicitudes que las entidades y vecinos de la costa realizan a este municipio sobre las definiciones de los temas planteados y cuyos informes les han sido enviados
1448417 es necesario hacer un plan director as como se ha hecho en el resto de la ciudad que no est dentro del plan ina 2000 pero mientras tanto los sectores de luces que tienen que dejarse previstos est n dentro de las observaciones el proyecto ejecutivo vial lo tiene que hacer vialidad y no lo ha entregado hasta ahora
1448418 i do not know that the prodigal saw his father but his father saw him the eyes of mercy are quicker than the eyes of repentance even the eyes of our faith is dim compared with the eye of gods love he sees a sinner long before a sinner sees him
1448419 you know everyday when you come home from work and ask me what i did today
1448420 today republicans will have a simple choice will they continue to stand with president bush vice president cheney and the modern day oil barons or will they join us on the side of struggling american families who deserve better
1448421 exactly the opposite of what the congress should be doing at a time when consumers are already burdened with record high energy prices

1448434 the federal open market committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth inflation has been high spurred by earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote substantial economic growth and price stability voting for the fomc monetary policy action were ben s bernanke chairman timothy f geithner vice chairman elizabeth a duke donald l kohn randall s kroszner frederic s mishkin sandra pianalto charles i plosser gary h stern and kevin m warsh voting against was richard w fisher who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting

1448445 its a great ruling for the teachers and the state employees

1448484 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
1448485 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

1448489 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
1448490 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
1448491 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
1448492 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
1448493 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
1448494 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
1448495 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse

1448497 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
1448498 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
1448499 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered

1448518 when the emperor constantine made christianity a national religion using it as a means for the spiritual authority of the whole empire the bloody persecutions of the roman empire stopped at last after that christianity spread rapidly over the whole territory of the roman empire in this expansion christianity developed the organization that made it the church and this institutionalized system became more and more centralized until at last the roman bishop became the father of the whole roman church and in this way imperial authority now getting its power from the political as well as the ecclesiastical union could declare all citizens of the state christians members of that church as a result the true nature of the ecclesia as the living body of christ was lost within that church and the latter just became a legal body regulated by church law instead of gods holy spirit faith like the laws of the state was reduced to a creed formulated for and remembered by the common members of the church those who did not accept the creed just as those who did not obey the law were punished
1448519 when christianity was transformed into such a legal institution it could no more be expected that communion or fellowship with god and christ would be the center of the ecclesia

1448646 young players are a little bit like melons only when you open and taste the melon are you 100 sure that the melon is good
1448647 the style of how we play is very important but it is omelettes and eggs no eggs no omelettes it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket you have class one two or class three eggs and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes so when the class one eggs are in waitrose and you cannot go there you have a problem
1448648 i would love an aston martin but if you ask me 1m for an aston martin i tell you you are crazy because they cost 250 000

1448657 as you know gallas had an unbelievable holiday i hope he enjoyed it very much in guadeloupe which i think is a fantastic place to be on holiday so he wanted to stay there for a long time
1448658 i did it because i want to push my son to do the same i also did it because i want to push the young players on my team to have a proper haircut not the rastafarian or the others they have
1448659 when i saw rijkaard entering the referees dressing room i couldnt believe it when drogba was sent off i didnt get surprised
1448660 if you ask me if i jump with happiness when i know mr poll is our referee no
1448661 i could feel immediately the movement to somebody that understands the game and feels the football smells the situation it was obvious
1448662 wenger has a real problem with us and i think he is what you call in england a voyeur he is someone who likes to watch other people there are some guys who when they are at home have this big telescope to look into the homes of other people and see what is happening wenger must be one of them and it is a sickness
1448663 three years without a premiership title i dont think i would still be in a job
1448664 many great managers have never won the champions league a big example is not far from us
1448665 liverpool are favourites because in the year 2007 weve played 27 matches and liverpool play three or four
1448666 if youre not a big club you choose one competition and you fight in that competition and forget the others big clubs we cannot do this
1448667 i am happy to be six points behind in my opinion manchester united did not take advantage of our bad moments
1448668 i want to give my congratulations to them because they won but we were the best team
1448669 this is the only time we have had to play before united and thats because we control the fixtures just imagine if we didnt control them
1448670 how do you say cheating in catalan barcelona is a cultural city with many great theatres and this boy has learned very well hes learned play acting
1448671 during the afternoon it rained only in this stadium our kitman saw it they tried everything there must be a microclimate here
1448672 we have eight matches and eight victories with 16 goals but people say we cannot play that we are a group of clowns this is not right
1448673 i think i have a naive team they are naive because they are pure and they are clean we dont have divers we dont have violent people
1448674 if chelsea are naive and pure then im little red riding hood
1448675 my wife will be glad about mourinho coming to bramall lane because hes a good looking swine isnt he
1448676 when mourinho says training will last one and a half hours it will never last a second longer

1448704 some may look at the cooling package of the tagan cs monolize and think that it is not very elegant but more along the lines of brute force well sometimes a hit with a big hammer is what gets the job done and tagan brought a really big hammer they stuck two fans pushing 150 cfm each in a case that only takes up 2 4 cubic feet of space so getting fresh air into the case is not an issue

1448727 i have a job thats enough for me to live on
1448728 now i have wealth now i have properly gathered through fair means
1448729 gradually increase wealth without squeezing others just as bees collect honey without harming flowers
1448730 i understand this is a very difficult time for these people
1448731 but the solution is not to let our medical system slide down the slippery slope of killing people in pain we must cure not kill this is not the right time for euthanasia
1448732 i agree but go further there is never a right time for euthanasia
1448733 the lives we lead are given to us by the grace of god and he decides when they end it is not for us to question gods divine purpose no matter how odd or screwed up it may seem
1448734 theyre choking the city the environment our lives cars must be banned
1448735 the only thing people are sick of is long haired idiots riding their bicycles at two miles an hour on major thoroughfares
1448736 people shouldnt be able to protest like this the government needs to crack down on them
1448737 its clear that we need to boost the level of automobile support in this country this protest this morning is a clear indication of um anyway we need more government funds
1448738 the thermaltake maxorb heatsink is a novel design based around a half dozen heatpipes and six individual arcs of cooling fins i have to wonder if its design was born out of a desire not to infringe on existing patents rather than sheer innovation but in any event the approach here guarantees an even fin pitch across the complete cooling surface area in that respect the maxorb breaks new ground allowing it to stand out from heatsinks of similar shape
1448739 silloin sy ksyy juna tunneliin ja ilon kyyneliin luonto puhkeaa
1448740 and hopefully we are very very close to a deal
1448741 you can kind of use that time frame to kind of gauge where this is all going to fall in place
1448742 we re very optimistic we think this is going to happen
1448743 it think it s largely a commodity price story especially as we ve seen oil prices start to look like they are on a downward trend
1448744 i think you re seeing some of that strength reverse as a result you re seeing some weakening in commodity based currencies including the canada
1448745 generally we re in an environment where the u s dollar seems to be on a bit of an upswing and that s adding further fuel to this depreciating trend for the canada
1448746 just last week we had the monthly gdp contract again so that made it the third of four months that we ve seen the canadian economy sort of shrink
1448747 that s shown that the weakness in the u s economy is having a real impact on canada s growth prospects and that s a also a reason that we started to see a bit of underperformance in the dollar
1448748 over the long term it will make manufacturers a little more competitive
1448749 unfortunately they re also dealing with a u s economy that s looking very much to be in recession
1448750 if it stays down it probably will relieve some of the pressure on manufacturers and exporters
1448751 even if it seems as though china s economic demand run has slowed some those changes at the margins still make them a huge consumer of crude products
1448752 any time you get that kind of violent price action in a short amount of time it reeks of someone big being in trouble
1448753 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1448754 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1448755 what we should do is make all immigrants foreigners and non native istrians folks slaves i mean who in istrians wouldnt like a minority slave group to do his bidding imagine people could be bought and sold over the internet
1448756 i am shocked and appalled at what my colleague is suggesting
1448757 slavery we should punish these offenders yes but send them to rehabilitation centres instead as for the ethnic squabbles programs in school should begin to stop these racist attitudes in childhood all it will take is some slight fortification to the education budget
1448758 now i may be a quiet old man but i believe that these ethnic disputes are none of the governments business its not our war anyway so its not our problem im sure if you leave it alone itll work itself out just think of the money that would be saved if the police dont have to be paid to deal with this
1448759 well maybe its time it became our war istrians should take a more active and by active i mean hostile role in international politics this ethnic squabbling will be over when the war is over and we can end that war and purge the impure harmony in symphony sieg istrians
1448760 sniff that air its never been so clean at last our society is freeing itself from the consumer death trap i say its time to take the final step and outlaw capitalism once and for all
1448761 think of the consequences without big business where do the jobs come from where do we get our medicine our cars our latest fashions there are dozens of useless regulations the government could abolish today to make life easier for commerce and its high time they did
1448762 turbulent and dangerous and the only sensible response to that of course is to build a lot more weapons unless we get the funding we need i cant promise that well be able to defend istrianss sovereign borders from rogue nations and foreign powers or those leaky boatloads of refugees for that matter
1448763 istrians needs fewer weapons not more make the world a safer place disarm now
1448764 it will provide an enormous stimulus to our economy and create thousands of new jobs its win win all we need from the government is permission to bulldoze the rainforest thats on top of the deposit
1448765 this rainforest is thousands of years old this country needs more environmental protection not less and to destroy the environment in order to mine uranium that then goes into nuclear bombs well that really sticks in my craw
1448766 we can preserve most of the rainforest and allow mining of a small part after all think of all the good that the money from this uranium deposit can bring to istrians
1448767 the commonwealth of istrians is a large socially progressive nation
1448768 as a policy maker it doesnt get any worse than this fed governor frederic mishkin said after a speech in washington on july 28
1448769 re what did you serve for after babys baptism 1 i didnt buy the godparents gifts i was born and raised catholic and no one in
1448770 so like oh my god you like totally have jackie kennedys fashion sense disregard that she helped her husband by speaking like seven different languages where did you get that hat
1448771 michelle obama said the challenges women face in balancing their families and jobs should be highlighted in government policies whether its through better health care or more family leave time
1448772 motherhood takes priority for all women women are responsible for setting aside their careers when their husbands are driving theirs forward our place is at the back of the white house and not the front etc
1448773 yeah balancing family and work is important but what really matters is addressing this terrible obesity epidemic that has crashed into america and mothers you can help by feeding your kids organic foods look at michelle obama look at how skinny and tall she is now thats a woman of good health shes educated and intelligent but she chose to support her husband and her kids isnt that the feminine motherly thing to do and you too can get up at 4 am and run on a treadmill like michelle

1448781 tendency to slide into the natural fallacy of empiricism to treat the work the object of the enterprise of criticism as factually given spontaneously isolated for inspection the work thus exists only to be received described and assimilated through the procedures of criticism
1448782 catching them young 2 political ideas in childrens fiction textbook

1448786 against evaluation the role of the critic of popular culture
1448787 the iron age is the first in which commodity production becomes a normal and indeed an essential part of economic activity
1448788 we remain critically short of blood plasma and various organs
1448789 especially hearts a good heart is hard to find but if we were allowed to pay for donations wed get more of them and could save more lives plus the donor takes home a few hundred energy credits in compensation unless its a post mortem donation of course in that case wed pay the family
1448790 except for one thing you know whos going to be selling their organs poor people theyll be so desperate for money that theyll sell their own kidneys well a kidney this is just another way for the rich to buy themselves a better life at the expense of the poor it must be outlawed
1448791 the fact is the auroch population is out of control
1448792 we have to do something about them anyway so why not market them as tasty snacks we could have auroch kebabs auroch pies auroch on a sticks the possibilities are endless lets not pass up this golden opportunity to provide a feast if you will for our economy
1448793 i agree that something needs to be done about auroch over population
1448794 but eating them thats kind of gross lets just shoot the ones we have to and shovel their bodies into ditches like normal
1448795 if anyone needs to be culled its us humans the aurochs were here first remember we need to take this as a sign to get our industry agriculture in particular to back off the auroch is part of what makes istrians a great nation
1448796 we are the backbone of this country and we demand a fair wage rise
1448797 i dont think a 20 increase over two years is too much to ask unless the government forces employers to give us our due well shut this whole industry down lets see how well istrianss economy manages without any book publishing huh
1448798 especially when you consider that without us theyd be out on the street hear that you scumbags out on the street anyway my point is if you cave in you make our entire industry uncompetitive you cant do that in the global marketplace itll hurt the whole country the best solution economically speaking would be to relax industrial laws and allow us to fire troublemakers on the spot
1448799 divorce should be illegal for better or worse anyone remember how that goes we should return to the good old days when you got married for life and stuck by your partner no matter how much of a drunken abusive adulterating disappointment they turned out to be
1448800 if couples would just call each other darling once in a while there would be far fewer relationship breakdowns a little affection is all it takes so the government should make it mandatory call your spouse darling at least once a day or face a fine
1448801 abolish those arcane laws that discriminate against same sex marriages its obscene to treat people differently because of their sexual preference besides everyone knows gay relationships are more stable than straight ones
1448802 my factorys productivity is down ten percent since marijuana was decriminalized

1448805 lo que estamos viendo son escaramuzas pol ticas estoy convencido en que a la larga la pol tica en serio se va a imponer y el parlamento va a aprobar un subsidio al transporte p blico

1448818 zotacs geforce 9800 gtx amp edition is the graphics card to get if youre looking for an excellent value single card offering with the ability to upgrade to sli later on an overclocked 9800 gtx definitely makes it a lot more attractive than the stock speed version and unlike other companies which only overclock the core zotac has done a complete overhaul by overclocking the core shaders and the memory resulting in the geforce 9800 gtx amp edition performing about 8 to 10 faster than a regular geforce 9800 gtx the only thing missing in the package is an sli bridge and to be picky wed have liked a better game but pound for pound this card packs great performance even if its still not a huge improvement on the 8800 gtx and its even cheaper than pnys geforce 9800gtx oc xlr8

1448873 of course it would be nice to cure these unnamed diseases but at what cost theyre messing with the sanctity of human life its wrong and the lab should be shut down immediately

1449017 maybe it is good that the residents learn that approach early on because it seems that most docs are becoming shift workers
1449018 lynden really does have that old feel wide streets and green lawns you get to know people theyre friendly its a community thats willing to help out individuals regardless of what their status is
1449019 we have a big nature area with padden creek watershed thats nice we also have a love hate relationship with the college student population but it seems to be getting better
1449020 the tightness and instantaneous feedback loop if youre doing good things to the community people know and when people are misbehaving its not long before that comes to the surface too because its such a word of mouth community it helps people behave
1449021 birch bay is a settlement community that is located right on the waterfront and is easily accessible for walking and swimming in the summer when the waters warm its the unique bay because of its horseshoe shape
1449022 its fun to be downtown and be able to walk out my door and go to restaurants events music and do things on the spur of the moment its supporting that whole idea of in fill doing my part investing in my downtown that i believe in
1449023 i love the small town atmosphere i love the fact that i can walk down the street and say hi to 25 or 30 people because i know who they are
1449024 its quiet nice neighborhood we like the view of the water and having space and the schools are good i like having single family homes and being able to have space and enjoy the natural beauty of bellingham
1449025 theres convenience in this neighborhood the proximity to whatcom falls park work the downtown area and to the barkley district theres a strong neighborhood commitment to support the environment too
1449026 i like the sense of neighborhood here its a safe place to walk and run and be outside the outdoor and lake recreation is right around the neighborhood too

1449030 additions to the theme file format were made for windows 7 they include
1449031 were launching two additional cloud computing centers and one of them is going to be an extremely large cloud computing center the largest that weve launched to date
1449032 both new facilities are examples of how were investing hundreds of millions of dollars to create extremely efficient datacenters based on cloud technologies and our enterprise architecture which weve instantiated in other cloud computing efforts
1449033 from a consumer perspective looking at it from the different use cases that are coming about you see the growth of these huge web 2 0 applications out there as well as the emergence of a huge mobile user base these applications require large amounts of compute resources just to handle the number of users because with the web 2 0 phenomenon people are actually contributing content back to these sites
1449034 its not to say that everybody is going to be exactly like youtube but even with a bank a user consuming your service could be a person standing on the side of the street hitting the refresh button on their stock ticker or account balance or whatever
1449035 thats going to create huge demand on the systems that are running these applications so it isnt just about back end data processing we want to talk about supporting lots of different types of workloads both user based workloads and back end based workloads
1449036 the thing thats really compelling about the cloud model when its used either internally or externally is that there are levels of efficiency that one is able to get that you just cant get with conventional data centers over time even internal datacenters will migrate more and more to a cloud approach where they adopt cloud principles such as virtualization
1449037 the software in these cloud datacenters is composed of a number of our tivoli products including a request driven provisioning product we also use a lot of xen but were able to use other virtualization technologies such as vmware too
1449038 customers arent going to be ripping out datacenters and replacing them with cloud centers overnight this is going to be a gradual process
1449039 its going to be a hybrid model with both internal and external clouds
1449040 create s a new opportunity to shape the relationship between those who use it services and those who sell them
1449041 obviously there are the early adopters who are out there playing with it right now but most of the world is trying to figure out what to do with it what it means what the value to them is going to be
1449042 at share were trying to introduce the technology the options get people into that planning phase get them better able to understand what it is theyre talking about
1449043 the idea of bigger clouds that transcend an individual organizations boundaries and kind of go to this notion of true utility computing is probably still a little further out

1449067 we have talked a lot and you will hear all of us talk about the process of grieving with hope
1449068 thats what has kept us breathing kept us alive is that while we are grieving this process there is a hope that we have that were anchored to in the midst of just what sometimes seems unbearable
1449069 well thats probably been one of the greatest challenges about walking through this and one of the things weve prayed most for in terms of needing strength and needing wisdom as parents
1449070 to drink at least one glass of tea each day to take care of myself to exercise to sleep well to avoid negative thinking to be kind to others and to myself
1449071 wow jen your hair has gotten so long duh as if four years of growth wouldnt amount to anything and all the students who i worked with four years ago when i was ill have since moved on from our program so my newer clients have no idea about what went on as it should be

1449077 but we need that information so our support team can verify if the problem is with your msn account

1449079 sir your information is safe with us we have a very explicit privacy policy that prevents us from disclosing your information to anyone outside of the company
1449080 i understand that but bear in mind that i too am subject to several ndas and privacy policies even if i wanted to give you my msn username and password which i dont i still couldnt do it because that would give you access to my contact list which includes many business contacts with my msn username and password it would be possible for someone to masquerade as me and acquire confidential information

1449084 my car was really loose all day but there at the end we got the car pretty decent
1449085 i cant complain it came to us finally and we got it to run we were on the same strategy as a lot of other guys we didnt get second today because of some trick we were on the same plan as the 99 carl edwards the 48 jimmie johnson and the 88 dale earnhardt jr and all those guys up front im just really proud of all these guys they stayed with it all day and all these home depot guys did a great job
1449086 we were a top 10 car but we werent a second place car until that red flag
1449087 i think the track tightened up and we got a lot better it really helped our car out
1449088 we got a little too tight there but it actually got us ahead of the 48 and ahead of a lot of these other guys that had been running up front once we were able to get track position and run up front we were all on the same pit strategy and the same fuel strategy so there wasnt a trick that got us up there it was a lot of hard work from zippy greg zipadelli crew chief and the guys we ran out of fuel on the cool down lap so it was perfect timing
1449089 i love the road courses theyre a lot of fun weve historically had pretty good luck there were leaving here with a smile on our face and looking forward to next weekend
1449090 the hard part was to run fast enough to stay in front of jimmie johnson and slow enough to save fuel
1449091 it was a challenge but considering what our luck has been this year this is as good as a win
1449092 blast works has been well received by the gaming community as one of the most innovative and creative games for wii
1449093 with the lower price point the game is among the best values available this summer and a must own for hardcore gamers budding game designers and action fans alike
1449094 we didnt show our true game we will regroup this week and head to nashville and pick up there
1449095 right now im coming off the turns in a four wheel drift
1449096 im so tight in that it is so loose off
1449097 thats pretty good we didnt have a great great run today we got a great finish and thats due to the guys on the champion mortgage 00 car with a good strategy peter sospenzo and the guys made a good call there at the end and got us in position to capitalize on the rain and all the cautions and what not but we really struggled we got the car pretty close there at the end and we lucked into that one but well take it because theres been plenty that weve lucked out of
1449098 well when your car is not working really well it always seems a little bit longer it just gets frustrating because im new and trying to learn as much as i can so you start running bad and youre man what am i doing wrong what do i need to do so you start trying to fix you and fix the car at the same time it gets tough and you start overdoing it and you start underdoing it and its a downhill spiral but luck was on our side today and thank god the rain came and worked out for us the way we needed it to i think this locks us back in the top 35 and puts us back in the chase for raybestos rookie of the year and now we go to watkins glen where i think we can challenge for a top 10
1449099 youve just got to feel lucky that you got the finish you got because the race car wasnt capable of the finish that we got there we just got to go back and figure out what weve got to do to be faster and take this good result and move on
1449100 not so much i mean we were pretty good they never said i needed to worry about it i saw people running out so i thought shoot maybe theyre just not telling me because they didnt want to worry me no stumbles toyota trd gives good power and good fuel mileage
1449101 yeah i mean we did it by fuel strategy today props go to dan stillman crew chief on the fuel strategy there he made the right call with what to do i was wondering when we first did it but it worked out to be the right thing didnt run the way we wanted we got a lap down early and at one point it looked like the car was going to have some promise to it it was pretty good there when i got to the front of the pack and got the lucky dog but couldnt get it going after that we just need to keep plugging away and were going to go do some testing and well see what we can learn
1449102 it was really frustrating that i struggled here last time just because the tracks that this place is supposed to remind you of ive heard different things i heard it was trenton and indy and milwaukee and phoenix well those are the places that ive always had the most fun at and always seem to run well at thats why i was really frustrated im like why cant i get this its three tracks that i love running at its nice to come back and be able to be a lot more competitive than what we were
1449103 we had an awesome car all weekend and to come away with such a points lead is really encouraging for the guys honestly im happy for him justin allgaier to win he had a great run and it was a very good battle at the end
1449104 it was really important the best way for us to make the chase is to remain consistent with our racecar each and every race its a tough battle right now for us to come here and gain two positions in the chase is a credit to kenny francis team director and all the guys that work on this budweiser dodge theres still a lot of racing left but today was a good day for gillett evernham and all the guys that work on our team
1449105 we had a good race car today just not as good as the 99 probably a second place car i got a little messed up on the strategy call when we decided not to pit and take track position before the red flag so we were a little fortunate to come out of here with a seventh place finish in the end we moved up to ninth and then a couple guys ran out of gas so well take the seventh place finish it was a good day for us in the points race and kasey kahne drove a great race considering where we are at in the race to the chase to come out of here with a top 10 is great
1449106 you never know whats going to happen so i decided not to pit i figured that half the field was going to pit and the other half would stay out track position here is really important and we really werent at our fuel window where we could make it to the finish on one more stop we only had six or seven laps on our tires so we knew that we were ok
1449107 strategy was important but our avis dodge was disappointing it would not go didnt have good power down the straightaways youre not going to win races like that its disappointing
1449108 stewart cooper crew chief made the right call there at the end we struggled at the start we werent really that bad we had a brake issue at the start of the race and may have been on our splitter a little bit we struggled through that and a pit sequence and got a lap down when youre in a position like that all you can do is ride and wait it out we got the lucky dog and got back on the lead lap the last two adjustments were the best two we had all day we picked up some spots there at the end which i think we earned
1449109 yeah we sure did im real happy with the mobil 1 dodge and all the guys that work on it we had good pit stops today the car was good and we had a top 15 car if not better than that im just real happy with the progress that weve made since we were here last time it seems like things are kind of starting to come together for us we need to keep this consistency up of having top 15 cars and then were going to start finishing there a lot more often you obviously want more out of it but just real happy with the guys and everything that theyve done and the progress that weve had since last time
1449110 the best buy dodge fought a tough handling condition almost the whole race we were loose then tight and back and forth all day we tried to gamble a little bit on pit stops to make up track position but we came up short on gas right there at the end its disappointing because we were in the top 20 with less than five laps to go but well go back to the shop and get ready for watkins glen next and give it our best
1449111 our car was too loose all day and we could never get it tightened up if youre off its just near impossible to fix it during the race we kept adjusting and trying to but just couldnt tighten it up we also had a brake issue and had a problem on the last pit stop and lost seven spots we should have finished seven spots better than where we did this was tough for us i hadnt driven their car before because of the rain saturday we didnt have an opportunity to work on the race setup
1449112 we fought a loose race car and got a little messed up with some pit strategy we pitted and when the rain came we didnt pit and eventually had to pit under green two more times which just screwed up our track position once you lose track position here its really tough to get it back and the yellows caution flags just didnt fall when we needed them today
1449113 we missed it on setup and got ourselves lapped and on a pit adjustment the leader beat us another lap we lost two and never got a chance to get them back i dont know if it would have made any difference if we had gotten the laps back thank god we have a road course coming up next week so we can get some momentum back with this race team
1449114 our day started off bad when we burned up the number five spark plug wire we changed it out and he juan pablo montoya drove all the way up to 18th position without us making any real big changes or having a real strategy so we know that our texaco havoline dodge was really good around lap 70 the car got real tight for some reason and we just couldnt figure it out we threw all sorts of changes at it and nothing seemed to work the engine may have been laying over im just not sure yet on that last caution lap 139 it dropped a cylinder and ended up blowing something in the engine its a little bit worrisome because we brought a new package here im sure our engine guys will figure it out

1449122 i just told the house chamber we the people can take back the capitol with these new media tools by networking and shining sunlight everywhere
1449123 one of the great advantages of politicking online is the ability to control delivery technologies
1449124 when the house republicans wanted to tell citizens that the democrats wouldnt allow a vote on their energy bill they went after young voters with messages on such short message systems as twitter and qik as well as the by now tried and true youtube more mature voters in their base were sought out through such websites as republican senate gov and an array of conservative blogs the scene was dramatic with all of this action occurring after the house closed for its august recess on friday night

1449133 iran is executing several children every year despite the fact that it is banned under international law
1449134 it is cruel and inhumane to apply the death penalty even to adults let alone to those convicted for crimes committed before the age of 18
1449135 execution of persons who were under the age of 18 at the time their offence was committed contrary to the obligations of the islamic republic of iran under article 37 of the convention on the rights of the child and article 6 of the international covenant on civil and political rights
1449136 irans insistence on executing juvenile offenders in the face of international law and international protests portrays an image of a judicial system bent on the application of state violence against juvenile offenders but unconcerned about justice or international law

1449153 tal como ya lo hab a anunciado el gobernador ney gonz lez esta obra se contempla en el plan estatal de desarrollo su inicio est programado en agosto del 2008 y se espera su terminaci n en mayo del 2009
1449154 sta es una de las obras de mayor demanda de los tepique os para resolver en gran medida los problemas de circulaci n vehicular y se sumar al primer nodo vial de insurgentes y m xico en el que el gobierno estatal invirti m s de 56 millones de pesos
1449155 la contrataci n para los proyectos industriales contin an experimentado retrasos
1449156 algunos de los retrasos son claramente el resultado de incertidumbres con respecto a pemex y la reforma energ tica actualmente siendo debatida en el congreso algo de esto puede ser un reflejo de la precauci n del sector privado acerca de la tasa de crecimiento de la econom a mexicana
1449157 estoy seguro que se lograr tener esperamos que en 18 meses

1449159 lo que ha pasado es que los mercados de deuda est n cerrados es decir no hay la disponibilidad de recursos que hab a antes y el pa s no est aislado de lo que sucede en el entorno internacional
1449160 sin embargo la buena noticia es que los fondos de inversi n andan buscando tener un porcentaje de activos en infraestructura porque son inversiones a largo plazo y con vol menes de rendimiento menos riesgosos
1449161 se trata de las autopistas del noreste y del golfo de m xico
1449162 en 2008 las presiones en el mercado hipotecario de estados unidos y espa a tendr pr cticamente parada la generaci n de nuevos cr ditos aunque habr liquidez en el mercado interesado en el tema de infraestructura
1449163 si bien es cierto que la infraestructura de ensenada es b sicamente para el tr nsito tur stico habremos de contemplar una modernizaci n carretera para no desproteger la zona
1449164 nosotros no tenemos comunicaci n porque el tramo est en jalisco y todos los tramos de colima ya est n hechos nosotros ah no tenemos nada que ver
1449165 lo est viendo el centro de estrategias junto con la consignada que es banobras y no tienen por qu llegarnos noticias de los avances directamente a nosotros
1449166 me parece muy mal porque estamos hablando de tres meses de retraso y aunque no participaban en la licitaci n empresas de jalisco afecta a la poblaci n porque estamos hablando de tres proyectos importantes para la sociedad el macrolibramiento el libramiento de puerto vallarta y la carretera v a corta a vallarta
1449167 es entendible porque no hay capital y seguramente este tiempo lo aprovechar n las empresas que compiten por la licitaci n para ver de d nde sacar n dinero
1449168 pero esos dos o tres que estaban listos con la ingenier a y financiamiento nos hace ser optimistas de que lo vamos a poder colocar a pesar de que los mercados est n mal

1449176 the sap vendor has not done the homework and is just ramming a solution down your throat after the least amount of no thought design work
1449177 this is messed up bigco systems var did not interview the key process people and performed no examination of the mature processes that are involved in the rapid replenishment process moreover this business had been profitable for years and has evolved systems which are stable and has vendors that are cooperative with the current processes none of this was taken into account rather the var is creating systems that have degraded work flow more steps opaque rules for forecasting and a 10x infrastructure and support costs i might also point out the current system oracle older has a near zero support cost and 100 availability furthermore bigco var has not disclosed that the trading partners will have to convert eventually their processes and possibly go the edi route for a fully automated rapid forecasting replenishment end to end solution no one ever told you or the suppliers that fact
1449178 i was invited to audit because there is a major stop go milestone here for a major hardware upgrade concurrent with decommissioning of the old oracle system which is madness why would you do that to burn a bridge so theres no going back

1449181 did anyone interview myrna for her insight and input into the supplier processes
1449182 oops never admit in a meeting of 30 people that you are totally clueless as a team as a vendor and as an organization
1449183 you started this re engineering process to help mesh suppliers with your carefully and organically perfected processes all you wanted was automation of the basic yet unique services that your key employees have been performing and will be performing for years this does not require 150k in blade servers and 220k in sap scn although now that you have it the api can be leveraged do not decommission the legacy systems
1449184 you know those new sap commercials for the small business its all whitewash

1449194 they are vw restoration projects that were too good to part out i have coupes and convertibles of all years but more interesting is my extensive collections of vintage and accessories i have been collecting since the 80s i will offer my collection through the airhead parts websites classified section and later on ebay i have over 1000 original vw restoration parts mostly ghia and some vw bug parts as well it will take a year to sell it all
1449195 because i only do a restoration every three or four years now i dont need all these ghias and associated parts so this is for all the active enthusiasts who are currently searching for restorable cars and or restoration parts and accessories for their air cooled projects
1449196 it is not uncommon now to see a resotred vw bus going for over 30 000 and the more common 70s vw bug which only a year or two ago went for 800 or 2 000 have doubled in price but they are still the most economical car on the market besides getting 26 34 mpg a full set of brakes for an old vw beetle is about 50 same is true for most vw beetle parts because they manufactured over 22 milliion in 4 or 5 countries for over 45 years so parts are easily supplied and still inexpensive

1449218 we continue to execute well and expect to gain share during these tougher operating environments
1449219 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1449220 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational ink between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1449221 the most conservative voting record of any member of the house from the northeast
1449222 im sorry but i dont think that letting our soldiers know we will make dumb deals to get them back even if they are dead will make them feel better
1449223 lets go back to 1991 when the gulf war was going on and the colorado buffaloes won a national championship seems like forever right
1449224 hace un tiempo me dijeron que el amor es una mierda de sentimiento en ese momento no me hizo sentido ahora me hace un poco m s de sentido que antes aunque a n no comparto plenamente esa filosof a
1449225 this is to teach that after all this and i will give peace in the land from here we learn that peace is equal to everything else as it is written
1449226 the opposite of a correct statement is a false statement but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth
1449227 the verse teaches execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates zechariah 8 16 but surely where there is strict justice there is no peace and where there is peace there is no strict justice
1449228 but what is that kind of justice with which peace abides we must say arbitration
1449229 i am fortunate to be joining an organization that has spent the past year building the critically important infrastructure necessary for success
1449230 now we have begun working with residents businesses and institutions around cambridge and will expand and accelerate our efforts over the next few months
1449231 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1449232 they have pollution in los angeles and if the olympics were in los angeles we would probably wear these masks too

1449239 my story demonstrates that not having it all figured out can sometimes be the greatest gift of all
1449240 perhaps designing couture dresses wasnt in the cards for me
1449241 reid loved it sent it out it got great reviews but he got cold feet because he didnt hear a single so i asked for a release
1449242 over the four years trust me hes been working on this its been a constant work in progress the tone has changed so much but i think we have something thats going to go down in the record books
1449243 i wanted a hip hop sonic feel something pure to the sound of hip hop with real drums real emotion and people taking solos in that sense this record feels like were moving in a new direction something hip hop should do
1449244 we can benefit greatly from a leader that offers sound judgment and experience rooted in the lives of real people the only way we can have this renaissance is with the senator from illinois as president of the united states we are on the brink of moving past our stigmas and preconceived thoughts to make a substantive decision for change the change is barack obama
1449245 hip hop is definitely not as good as it once was
1449246 there was a time when disco was the shit and steve rubell had studio 54 but the minute you heard disco duck by rick dees that was the telltale sign that disco was over i think that if hip hop continues on the path that it seems like its going down then it looks like its not going to hold up
1449247 this has yet to be verified inside thermal and evolved gas analyzer instruments
1449248 this does not preclude life on mars in fact it is a potential energy source
1449249 when i saw that it was in brooklyn and i saw the price i thought oh no whats this place going to be like but its been a nice surprise its clean and it has office space
1449250 i dont need any extra motivation my motivation is to win
1449251 im very proud of my area around the plate i dont want anyone messing with my dirt
1449252 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
1449253 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
1449254 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1449255 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1449256 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1449257 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1449258 were at the point now where a lot of very large customers are deploying uac
1449259 at this stage of the market evolution for nac where people are moving beyond pilot phases new types of requirements come up around usability scalability and user experience
1449260 one of the problems with nac in the last couple of years is that because it has been billed as such a huge thing for so many different needs it has caused confusion and in some cases customer hesitation
1449261 now were seeing that its into peoples heads why they need nac were seeing people move beyond pilots into full enterprise wide deployments of uac across a lot of different verticals
1449262 an opportunity to surrender themselves so that they dont have to spend time in a detention facility
1449263 the safety of our teachers and researchers is of highest priority
1449264 at this point nobody has claimed responsibility for the attacks but were focusing the investigation towards animal rights extremists
1449265 the tomtom gps is working i consult that six times a day
1449266 the tomtom gps from my car is rather confused to find itself in the middle of the pacific
1449267 i would very much want to make it energy efficient self sufficient
1449268 its hard to tell from the reader comments its a self selecting sample
1449269 but something i set out to do is draw people to the web site in hopes that theyll stick around long enough to get the environmental messages
1449270 i did have to work up to this kind of thing it was incremental i didnt go from an office job to rowing across an ocean
1449271 my first thought was that is the best idea ive ever had of course my second thought was that was without a doubt the worst idea ive ever had
1449272 in asia friendster is almost twice the size of any other social network
1449273 the most difficult thing is the decision to act the rest is merely tenacity your fears are paper tigers you can do anything you decide to do you can act to change and control your life and the procedure the process is its own reward
1449274 typically you would see an increase in inventory and a small decrease in sold data from june through september
1449275 these indicators at this point in the calendar year are both unusual and indicative of an improving situation that will likely begin affecting market wide prices in the first half of next year
1449276 these are the final two building blocks in a pattern that suggests a return to a healthier market
1449277 weve seen similarly suggestive data through the earlier part of the year with respect to year over year inventory and rising numbers of contracts now up 6 9 year to date over 2007
1449278 many people had a hard time seeing that we really were slowing down we didnt see the decline in sold data until it strongly impacted the market in august 2007
1449279 we can attribute the slower upper end market to difficulties obtaining financing and large levels of inventory this price point will likely follow behind as lower price points see appreciation and as sellers use that equity for purchasing into the upper end market
1449280 considering denver has had between 1 per year and 2 per year appreciation for the last seven years its inevitable that the higher level will take time to catch the pace that has been exhibited in the lower ranges
1449281 acto de deslealtad posible corrupci n y podr a constituir traici n a la patria
1449282 esa fue la verdad que se nos dijo el v deo de ayer demuestra que la realidad era diferente el logo del cicr se utiliz desde el comienzo de la operaci n lamentamos mucho que eso haya sucedido
1449283 vamos a averiguar qu fue lo que sucedi vamos a tomar acciones
1449284 es grave que integrantes de las fuerzas armadas filtren noticias de manera clandestina y sin coordinaci n con sus superiores adem s es grave que en las primeras investigaciones sobre la operaci n no haya salido a relucir toda la verdad
1449285 la necesidad de permitir que todos los medios de comunicaci n tengan igual y oportuno acceso a las noticias m s importantes
1449286 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1449287 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1449288 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1449289 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1449290 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1449291 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1449292 governor you said 18 months experience wasnt enough experience as governor to be the vice president would you want to contrast that with the 143 days experience obama as senator before he decided he had enough experience to be president

1449296 you can call it the ted allen rule the best qualification for being a reality host or judge is having been a reality host or judge
1449297 dentro de las dif ciles circunstancias que est viviendo el mundo en 2008 los programas instrumentados en m xico est n dando buenos resultados
1449298 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
1449299 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1449300 while the first half of his foreign trip to afghanistan and iraq was official the european tour was campaign related yet it was on this leg that a visit to wounded u s soldiers had been scheduled as campaigning in a military hospital is prohibited the visit was canceled
1449301 visited a casualty unit in the green zone without photographers as part of the congressional delegation
1449302 i can attest to the fact that he did visit troops in iraq only four or five days earlier that there was no notice of it that i confirmed that it happened but they had no video of any type and no reporters and that hes been to walter reed so lets at least get that off the table
1449303 the sense that you know barack is not one of us hes just not a normal guy who would go see the wounded troops
1449304 this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it
1449305 two points one they know they are lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1449306 they need to do their homework because this is serious business
1449307 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1449308 those nations must be responsible to their citizens their populations and their futures
1449309 and it was paid for by me and mostly by my child

1449314 the impatient money has become even more impatient and cerberus is an impatient money company how long can they tolerate negative cash flow
1449315 i wish i could be more optimistic but i dont see any daylight here
1449316 i doubt seriously as an outsider that they were planning a quick spin here
1449317 it may be that they sold chrysler as possibly the best moment they could for their own health
1449318 you think you can get rid of me that easily
1449319 the professionalism of the emergency providers from these counties in training and using polyheme was exceptional we were all joined by the desire to find a better way to treat people at the earliest moments of serious trauma

1449328 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd said tony fratto the white house deputy press secretary
1449329 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate
1449330 cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1449331 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1449332 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
1449333 do you really think that being more responsible with our resources will cripple the economy
1449334 how changes to beliefs about climate change occur when consumers read information supplied by the news media
1449335 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth
1449336 in a world with so many things you cant change cant effect its something every adult can show up for and make a difference today
1449337 its a reality and its been a reality for a long time
1449338 its alot of responsibility to put on a child to tell another adult when often times the adult may be the abuser
1449339 its basic its practical and you walk out of there knowing something new to make the kids around you safer
1449340 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and ebola
1449341 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1449342 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction
1449343 in malaysia sumatra and borneo the big problem is destruction of forests to make way for palm oil and biofuels ironically with biofuels something that is nominally associated with helping the environment can have harmful unintentional consequences
1449344 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1449345 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1449346 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1449347 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1449348 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in central africa there may be other populations
1449349 were talking about the congo basin rainforest here it is vast it is huge its second only to the amazon and its impenetrable
1449350 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and it will be a major focus this season

1449361 you were not rated high enough for consideration for this position based upon your responses to the job specific questionnaire no further determination as to your qualifications or eligibility was made

1449370 why isnt barack obama doing better why after all that has happened does he have only a slim two or three point lead over john mccain according to an average of the recent polls why is he basically tied with his opponent when his party is so far ahead
1449371 im sure rowan will kick out of bounds hell punt out of bounds he has too
1449372 i was performing for people in wheelchairs and amputees and they still walked out
1449373 over the past 20 years its phenomenal how much building costs have gone up
1449374 since habitat here in missoula began back in 1991 weve seen lot sizes go down and down and lot prices go up and up
1449375 developers and builders have always been generous with us but we just arent getting as many donations as we used to that effort isnt there like it was last year or the year before
1449376 with the exception of grants we may receive all of our income comes from missoula its missoulians giving us money and helping us build houses for other member of the community
1449377 both of these figures were clearly impacted by the slowdown in the building industry
1449378 when they sell everything out there wont be any more lots available so we are concerned about a couple years out when we dont have a partnership like this
1449379 i have heard from some of our volunteers a woman from alberton for example i cant donate money to you because i have to give all that to the gas station so i can come down and help build the house
1449380 instead of providing homes for the needier we have to go up the income bracket in missoula to find someone who can afford the cost of the home
1449381 we dont want to set someone up to fail we dont want to put someone in a position where they cant pay their mortgage so we have to go up that income bracket to make it work
1449382 they do not provide an integrated comprehensive approach to guide the partnership program overall
1449383 stating the need to reassess available embassy personnel to support dod activities in country
1449384 lacking guidance from agency headquarters country team officials have tried to establish agreements between state and dod
1449385 include clear goals objectives and milestones including output and outcome indicators and identify resources needed to achieve the programs goals
1449386 given the growing threat of terrorism in northwest africa as well as the possibility of the partnership programs expansion to other countries and agencies addressing these factors is essential to strengthening u s agencies collaborative efforts to combat terrorism in the region
1449387 the huge swath of largely open territory in the sahel provides aqim with an important base for smuggling logistics recruiting and training fighters aqim focused its major attacks on algeria but continued to operate in the sahel region crossing difficult to patrol borders between mali mauritania niger algeria and chad to recruit extremists within the region for training and terrorist operations in the trans sahara and possibly for operations outside the region
1449388 is always pained to have to extend tours he understands the effect that has on the families of our forces but he also appreciates our commanders need to make additional progress while the weather is still good in afghanistan
1449389 how the heck do i make this a practical investment into my current house
1449390 i want to transfer the message that no one is above the law
1449391 they didnt have anything against her it was unfair procedure on behalf of the religious police
1449392 slowly slowly the religious police are facing the prospect of answering questions in the courtroom a completely novel idea for them
1449393 if you are religious that doesnt mean you can violate the rights of others this is a simple message
1449394 but until now it seems they havent read this message they are still practicing illegal acts in an arrogant way
1449395 people have been afraid of the religious police in saudi arabia but our case is helping marginalize this dragon this paper tiger
1449396 the qatif case moved many opinions in the saudi community
1449397 it broke the idea that the judges dont make mistakes
1449398 hes one of the brave ones he has a lot of public support
1449399 by citing those rights repeatedly and insisting they be applied al lahim is trying to bring the law into the courtroom trying to take away from the arbitrary powers of judges
1449400 if youre accused of theft or murder or embezzlement you will have a hard time finding a lawyer who can defend you in court
1449401 we talk about a new saudi arabia during king abdullahs term it includes restructuring the judiciary system
1449402 not much has changed yet but now there are new foundations and deep changes in these foundations i wont say that weve reached the top but we are walking stably
1449403 we are mainly concentrating on female victims for the time because we think women here dont have enough legal support
1449404 of course there are difficulties in a profession like this in saudi arabia
1449405 but the legal profession is at its core about human rights so this pushes you to continue despite of all the difficulties
1449406 who have suffered persecution as a result of their professional activities amp we are honoring your bravery for standing up to injustice
1449407 the few brave people who have really put their name on the line who say the time for reform in saudi arabia is now i have a lot of respect for them and i think were slowly going to see the fruits of their effort
1449408 there is a support from people especially from the new generation in the saudi arabia that values human rights we get calls and e mails from them supporting us
1449409 one prominent turning point came in 2002 when more than a dozen girls died in a school fire after religious police forced them back into the building
1449410 we are true muslims and true pakistanis and are more concerned about the countrys safety than any other countryman
1449411 we are very clear about the talks we never denied talks with the government if the government were not aggravating the situation here we too would not do so we do not want activities inside the country so that we can focus more attention across the border
1449412 we are true muslims and true pakistanis and are more concerned about the countrys safety than any other countryman
1449413 it was well known that mr tenenbaum was jewish lived his religious beliefs and by his actions appeared to have a close affinity for israel
1449414 we believe that mr tenenbaum was subjected to unusual and unwelcome scrutiny because of his faith and ethnic background a practice that would undoubtedly fit a definition of discrimination
1449415 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own
1449416 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results

1449418 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1449419 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place

1449422 they told her that the best thing she could do for al qaeda was to start popping out little jihadists

1449468 uv rays emit free radicals into the skin causing damage to key proteins in the cell walls as well as tissues such as collagen and elastin says sherrard
1449469 wrinkles pigment spots and worst of all skin cancer are the result of free radical damage when the skin is overexposed to the sun inflammation is present and the immune response has been activated this is a sign that cell damage and the repair process has already started
1449470 antioxidants will help prevent further damage to cells by donating extra electrons to the free radicals which are damaging skin cells
1449471 sun damage also known as photoaging is a somewhat fancy word for premature aging due to over exposure to the sun the most natural way to reverse the effects of sun damaged skin is the intake of vitamin a both topically and internally the rawest and most natural source will provide the best results
1449472 argan oil is very emollient and rich in naturally occurring antioxidants such as flavonoids and tocopherols which have anti inflammatory properties its anti aging and skin restructuring properties coupled with a high vitamin a and vitamin e content make it a wonderful skin product ingredient

1449500 there were a series of shops that had been painted a yellow the same colour as one of our brands there

1449502 i am satisfied that bat was in breach of the contract with the farmers when it failed to buy their tobacco which it was obliged to under the contract as well as under the tobacco control and marketing regulations
1449503 bat is liable to pay the farmers for the value of the tobacco delivered to its marketing sheds it is appropriate to take the price provided by the defendant which puts the average price at sh1 200 per kilo
1449504 bat made us to suffer when it abandoned us with the tobacco which it contracted us to grow and we had nowhere else to sell it

1449506 help prevent the tobacco epidemic from taking root in africa
1449507 when i announced this initiative i said that i hoped others would step forward
1449508 im delighted bill and melinda gates are supporting one of the most important public health efforts of our time our commitments will help governments confront the tobacco epidemic by implementing the proven mpower package this means assuring well staffed tobacco control programs raising tobacco taxes running hard hitting public information campaigns creating comprehensive smoke free public places and banning tobacco advertising
1449509 tobacco caused diseases have emerged as one of the greatest health challenges facing developing countries
1449510 the good news is we know what it takes to save millions of lives and where efforts exist they are working we are pleased to join with mayor bloomberg who has made the fight against tobacco a priority in new york city and around the world
1449511 bill and i want to highlight the enormity of this problem and catalyze a global movement of governments and civil society to stop the tobacco epidemic
1449512 we challenge governments to show leadership by implementing tobacco control measures as an increasing number are doing and to increase funding for these efforts

1449538 dr michael ross of the university of pennsylvanias new bolton center starting in february did her throat surgery if it wasnt for him we might not be racing anyway
1449539 he was the one i called in an emergency after she ran that week in the coaching club oaks at the meadowlands in june and was lame we were trying to find out where she was lame she had some minor issues but she was basically racehorse sound he looked at her did some work that was a tuesday
1449540 on wednesday i had her shipped up to dr ray derman who is a chiropractor to me as a horse trainer it was like throwing darts ive never been a believer in chiropractic for a horse never i am now i was throwing darts i couldnt leave any stone unturned i had to do everything and anything basically the only thing i wasnt doing was calling the horse psychic
1449541 the only thing we knew is that it was lameness on the right side we took her to dr derman and he said her pelvis was very off center and her stifle a joint below the hip in the hind legs was off they had to realign the stifle also
1449542 we raced that week and we won in the miller elims on july 4 by 3 1 2 lengths in 1 54
1449543 we went back and won the miller on july 11 by 1 3 4 lengths in 1 54 after the race john campbell said very good not super not the snow white we knew last year
1449544 from there wed already made an appointment with dr ross at new bolton before she raced in the miller final
1449545 we were going there to get bone scans x rays everything you can possibly think of to try to pinpoint exactly what this was
1449546 we went on to the hambletonian oaks but what didnt i mention
1449547 he said kevin if you want someone whos very good with lameness and chiropractic give dr mitchell a chance
1449548 i had to bring another horse to gaitway farm in n
1449549 wow this horse is in terrible shape her pelvis is out of whack
1449550 the only way ill know if shes better is to race her he said kevin you can train her tomorrow if you want shes going to be as good tomorrow as shes going to be on friday i said ok
1449551 so i left her there with her groom deshawn sample and i told them id see them the next morning at 8 00 a m i trained her at gaitway farm a mile in 1 53 2 i thought ok ill drop her in to go john came in off the race bike the other night after winning the duenna by 3 1 2 lengths in 1 53 2 and said shed never been better since a 2 year old shes probably going to end up doing quite a bit of chiropractic work
1449552 since she was a 2 year old shed bite the bottom two or three boards in her stall and slam herself into it on her right side
1449553 it was her way of playing if someone came up to her stall shes not all that human friendly and instead of coming to the front of the stall shed bite at the boards and throw herself into the wall
1449554 thats the only thing we can come up with as to what happened to her in between the second qualifier and the first start she threw herself hard enough that she threw herself out of whack
1449555 somewhere along in there she did it and once she did it once it was easily thrown out again and you have to take care of it quite a while to get it back healed
1449556 needless to say her stall is now only about six boards high if she threw herself into it shed go over it she doesnt have a wall to slam it into now its probably three to four feet tall all the way around she wont go out of it she has zero interest in trying to get out she was her own worst enemy
1449557 its a scary thing when youve got a horse named snow white that theyre doing it to
1449558 she loves it absolutely enjoys it anything you have to do to her shell let you do the magnetic blanket the mask on her face does it all she never moves she knows youre trying to help her
1449559 shes going to face the boys at chester were getting brave now thats her next stop and i dont know if shes got enough to go in the first division or the second there are multiple divisions seeded by earnings with the highest purse for highest money earners going for 500 000 shell be getting some sort of chiropractic and well be in touch with dr ross all the time hes the quarterback

1449575 we study a unification of gravity with yang mills fields based on a simple extension of the plebanski action to a lie group g which may be applied to lisis proposal of an e8 unified theory giving a fully e8 invariant action the extended form of the plebanski action suggests a new class of spin foam models
1449576 that a spin network can describe the world and that in ancient days the network was disorderly with connections every which way not like a regular 3d lattice with the passage of time the network smoothed itself out somewhat and evolved into a more regular configuration giving the semiclassical illusion of the 3d space we know and love
1449577 ut there persisted this residue of long range connections some pairs of nodes that were paradoxically both near and far to a local observer who cannot see the other end these look like severed links culdesacs singletons unmatched socks this strikes me as being of the nature of a just so story creation myth or better a creation hunch because o ye of insatiable curiosity the unmatched socks are matter they are what scholars call fermions
1449578 however labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth

1449580 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1449581 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1449582 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1449583 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1449584 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1449585 i think if they really build one of these quantum computers there will definitely be resonators in them
1449586 you may already know this but have you tried thing

1449601 i often think that we are often not well served by words like anxiety or depression which imply that what we are talking about is just a magnification of a temporary bad mood

1449603 implies that youre stupid and 2 reveals their discomfort with your disability
1449604 dissemble no more i admit the deed tear up the planks here here it is the beating of his hideous heart
1449605 wow it sounds like youre having a rough time you know you can talk with me anytime but i also want you to know that the university provides counseling services sometimes just talking with someone who you know is disinterested is sufficient and if it isnt they are a good position to help you figure out what else to do i found that really helpful though i had trouble finding someone good to talk with about my problems

1449610 you know have you ever heard of this thing called a 504 that might really help your son

1449618 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
1449619 there doesnt seem to be a lot of room for nuance
1449620 the compensation system is actually shaping the force rather than having the force managers be able to do any force shaping
1449621 i tend to think they dont have a lot of faith in this case
1449622 when jessie left he believed everyone in the home was dead
1449623 but as we know through the grace of god three children survived
1449624 the expanded agreement with nanogen gives us the opportunity to open up our potential market by providing full panels of diagnostics for respiratory illnesses
1449625 the rapid accurate diagnosis of these infectious diseases will enable quicker treatment and recovery times for patients
1449626 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1449627 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1449628 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1449629 we are delighted to contribute to the important work that professor desimone and his students are undertaking in the field of nanomedicine this work answers key questions about the role of particle shape and size that industry leaders have been asking for some time
1449630 this study is one step towards a greater insight into the relationship between oily substances and water at the molecular level an area of fundamental science which is relatively little understood but which has enormous potential for industry medicine and nanotechnology
1449631 it was very interesting to see that our results suggest there is no tiny gap between oil and water when they meet despite having a reputation for not liking each other it seems the opposite is true they may not be able to mix but they come into full contact with each other at a strong interface perhaps they like each other more than we previously thought
1449632 this funding will allow us to explore largely uncharted capabilities and applications that are inherent in our core technologies
1449633 this seed funding will support a proof of concept demonstration of our capabilities if successful we will be seeking larger amounts of funding for continued development for this brand new application of our technology
1449634 yasunobu nakamura and jaw shen tsai are outstanding experimental physicists and they were selected from a very strong list of nominations
1449635 they were the first to show that quantum coherence could be displayed in a superconducting device opening the way to a completely new solid state quantum computer architecture and a new regime in which to test quantum mechanics these results had been long sought by physicists and must rank as one of the greatest achievements in physics of recent years nakamura and tsai redefined the research programs of many top research groups worldwide since the first results on this emerged from this group in the late 1990s they have remained leaders in the field and have gone on to provide a number of further very significant results
1449636 we cant let little countries screw around with big companies like this companies that have made big investments around the world
1449637 shes a mentor to scores of young women at the paper and routinely takes them under her wing
1449638 to be fair to rupert and thomson there wasnt a particularly strong bench of women there in the first place
1449639 but i think the boys clubbiness of murdoch and thomsons management structure is hard to ignore
1449640 male or female it doesnt matter all the senior executives at wsj are unpleasant passive aggressive schemers who will just as soon rub your back as put a knife in it
1449641 i gave iron horse almost 2 years notice on this so they have had many months to plan for the future and they have done a great job of it they will be out with plenty of new bikes in 2009 and 2010 dont you worry
1449642 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand would be with me and that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
1449643 there are no immediate plans to access either the proposed liquidity or the proposed capital backstop paulson said and any lending to the mortgage giants would be done
1449644 this falls into the category of legitimate differences in opinion

1449651 due to the delay in providing you with the translation you are expected to comply with the tobacco control act 2007 part vi 210 within six months
1449652 unfortunately africas capacity to speak and act as one body for the implementation of the treaty has been weak the fctc process provided funds and a framework for african countries to get together but it seems the continent is at risk of loosing momentum
1449653 it is gratifying to note that in november 2008 the who african region would host the third conference parties in south africa to strengthen the political momentum on tobacco control and the fctc in the region
1449654 who estimates that the highest increase in deaths from non communicable diseases over the next 10 years would occur in africa
1449655 by year 2025 tobacco will kill twenty million people and seven million in developing countries including ghana tobacco shortens the lifespan of smokers by twenty five years with about 70 of people who begin smoking from their teens die by age forty five
1449656 more than 85 of the worlds 1 8 billion young people living in developing countries are aggressively targeted by the tobacco industry the rise in the use of tobacco products among girls and young women is one of the most ominous developments of the global tobacco epidemic
1449657 the who appeals to member states and policy makers to require by law a comprehensive ban on all forms of advertising promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products the organisation calls on non government organisations to develop broad multi sectoral coalitions to advocate for effective tobacco control policies and the international community to increase technical legal financial cooperation to help tobacco growing countries to transition towards economically viable alternative livelihoods

1449665 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1449666 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1449667 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1449668 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1449669 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1449670 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1449671 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1449672 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1449673 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1449674 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1449675 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1449676 it is very difficult to speculate on what will happen to house prices over the next year or so
1449677 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1449678 it is a welcome initiative and shows that ministers appreciate the problems the current housing market situation is causing people looking to buy and sell properties and the impact it is having on the wider economy
1449679 the government shouldnt be trying to bribe people into buying houses in a falling market
1449680 with the economy grinding to a halt we are already likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make this situation worse
1449681 we dont know whose fault it was there will be a full investigation by the air accidents investigation branch any incident big or small has to be investigated
1449682 our flight lh4853 was parked with the brake on when another aircraft came by and just touched the tip of the wing
1449683 no one was hurt and all the passengers are now safely back in the terminal building
1449684 we are hoping to be able to fly them all on to germany today if possible
1449685 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
1449686 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time
1449687 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
1449688 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now
1449689 was released at the end of june 2005 and featured remixes from jj flores and peter bailey
1449690 you make me want to be a man bloodshy amp avant mix

1449692 thats have to look that up when i get home
1449693 the main objective is to protect peoples health and in terms of tobacco you are protecting the smoker and you are also protecting people around the smoker
1449694 let us all accept that a majority of kenyans are non smokers and a few smokers are endangering the lives of those majority kenyans
1449695 vehicles emit dangerous fumes but nobody cares toilets and sewers in this city are stinking what makes cigarettes so bad as to warrant a ban
1449696 if cigarattes are really bad why are we allowed to buy a whole packet and not one stick
1449697 the idea of that is to limit the number of people who are buying but if 10 people come together and buy one packet then that is within the law and we cannot do anything about it
1449698 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1449699 i exercised to the point where he made me throw up
1449700 i thought hed be kind of supportive about it rub my back or hold my hair out of my face there was none of that at all
1449701 well yes i think it is i come from a moral background and i can see the power of the show and imagine my old school teachers cringing or my grandparents thinking oh my god when they see me say having sex on a barstool but you have to remember this is not a reality show its supposed to be pure entertainment
1449702 i never actually said i disliked having my top off it was just that on that occasion it didnt make sense
1449703 nate was supposed to be waking up hungover on his buddys couch so why would he be in his boxer shorts
1449704 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1449705 ive always been a trivial pursuit fan and i can really see tv audiences becoming obsessed with this addictive format
1449706 once you start its hard to stop and i think viewers fascination with pop culture will keep them coming back for more or they can tune in and be bathed in my boyish enthusiasm
1449707 this doesnt say much however as the reliability of the test results has always been too low to provide accurate comparisons between schools
1449708 while the reliability of the key stage 2 results has to be treated with a massive pinch of salt there is no evidence of a decline in standards despite this years chaos primary schools are doing well
1449709 should have taken the opportunity to ask lord sutherland to conduct a fundamental review of the entire flawed testing system
1449710 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
1449711 the program was run wrong my staff should have caught it we were wrong

1449729 my hunch was right now i have a decent stock for the hard times ahead
1449730 i have been smoking two packs a day for more than 15 years now
1449731 i cannot kick this habit now it soothes my nerves when customers haggle over fares and this happens often now that the petrol prices have gone up too
1449732 i have just made this decision for health and financial reasons
1449733 i have been compelled to issue the above si due to the continued smoking in public places by persons that have no regard for the comfort of others
1449734 we want our students and youth to adopt behaviours that protect their health and well being for tobacco kills more than aids illegal drugs road accidents murder and suicide taken together
1449735 we aim at reducing both the supply and demand of tobacco products on the local market
1449736 warning smoking damages the health and causes death the damaging effect of smoking harms the smoker and the non smoker smoking for a long period of time affects marital relations
1449737 warning smoking damages the health and causes death the damaging effect of smoking harms the smoker and the non smoker smoking around pregnant women harms the fetus and causes miscarriage
1449738 warning smoking damages the health and causes death the damaging effect of smoking harms the smoker and the non smoker smoking affects children protect your children from smoking
1449739 warning smoking damages the health and causes death the damaging effect of smoking harms the smoker and the non smoker smoking causes diseases of the heart and circulatory system
1449740 i would like to quit but i just cant but when you see pictures like this like that sick man that has an effect it does encourage you to stop
1449741 this one specifically will have an effect on egyptians since they are really concerned about that
1449742 egypt is an extraordinarily challenging country because it has such a culture of smoking its so ingrained in day to day living
1449743 not just in human capacity and lives but the cost in dealing with all the disease generated by it
1449744 we need something to give the smokers a shock that they are in great danger
1449745 ive been smoking since i was eight years old i used to pick up cigarette butts from the gutter and smoke them
1449746 we are committed to the health and quality of life of our guests and associates and that includes providing a clean smoke free environment our core customers are road warriors who we know endure a rigorous travel schedule at sheraton and four points by sheraton we want to provide a welcoming comfortable atmosphere that is healthy
1449747 we are obviously delighted by the result breathing second hand smoke is like being punished for sins you did not commit it exposes the non smoker to the same deadly diseases as a smoker
1449748 workers in public places such as waiters and waitresses non smokers in a smokers home are particularly vulnerable we will be resuming full scale enforcement of the law in the interest of public health and safety
1449749 we express our concerns over your continued aggressive marketing and the promotion of tobacco products that you well know cause disease disability and death to all who consume and or get exposed to them including the unborn babies you have adamantly continued with impunity to put tiny weak illegible health warnings on your cigarette packets
1449750 the international empirical literature clearly shows that the most effective and cost effective intervention is an increase in the tax on cigarettes
1449751 have more in mind than simply sharing a personal story of faith they want to shape your story to be the like their story otherwise you arent actually saved in other words they want you to become in your hearts evangelicals
1449752 by june we are going to outlaw smoking in public buildings in the federal capital territory fct
1449753 hopefully this will be the first step towards cleansing in the next couple of years a total ban on smoking in the fct
1449754 now that nigerians are waking up from their slumber cigarette producing factories should know that time is almost up for them
1449755 just as cigarette manufacturers were chased out of europe the last factory will be closed in nigeria in our lifetime
1449756 it is the determination of the federal ministry of health to ensure the full domestication of the fctc in nigeria
1449757 we will appeal all the way to the supreme court and back

1449788 we have to lay off our sports desk in part because the blogging community has stolen enough of our thunder that we cant afford to keep paying them
1449789 if run properly these sites can be better protected than a national park because in a national park the public is allowed in these areas no one is allowed except the workers and their behavior is tightly controlled and monitored
1449790 so it is pretty easy for me to see a partnership between industry and the conservationists in addition they have money to support research projects
1449791 we have pictures of jaguars carrying armadillos in their mouths and we have a picture of a puma wrestling a red brocket deer to the ground so we get some indication of what these predators are eating
1449792 but we also get mating behavior we have repeated pictures of jaguars copulating right in front of the camera traps all of these mating jaguar pictures are taken in may and june which turns out to be near the end of the long rainy season so we suspect that its not true that these animals breed all year long but in fact they breed at a certain time of year in response to rainfall and have their young several months later during the dry season
1449793 most american zoological association aza zoos do not exhibit small cats because they do not believe the public wants to see them they instead exhibit the large and charismatic small cats

1449805 these by laws were driven by malice and no one was consulted when they were brought in we are looking up to the tobacco control act coming up later in the year and we shall abide by its provisions
1449806 we are developing our strategy and will make it public soon
1449807 our focus now will be on a sound distribution channel so that we have reduced out of stocks
1449808 we took the opportunity to be serious about our jobs
1449809 to receive contracts and expect someone to approve them in a matter of hours or days is totally ludicrous

1449831 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
1449832 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
1449833 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
1449834 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
1449835 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
1449836 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

1449855 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
1449856 we believe this was caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam
1449857 we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression

1449864 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
1449865 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
1449866 the pattern and string of attacks has been escalating against the research and science community here as well as at other university of california campuses
1449867 unconscionable that any person would commit this act of cowardice and terrorize individuals in the name of animal rights
1449868 the cartoon issue really really hurt muslims around the world

1449874 on behalf of the director general of who dr margaret chan and regional director for africa dr luis gomes sambo i congratulate justice crabbe for winning the award
1449875 there is no freedom in the slavery to nicotine addiction since tobacco is a health issue not a freedoms issue
1449876 tobacco has been a subject of intensive debate on the international health agenda for quite too long
1449877 now that ive had a few weeks under my belt in my industry role ive been able to do some more thinking about my previous post here are some of my thoughts
1449878 we asked for adjournment to give us time to continue this process
1449879 if this case gets to the evidence stage the companies are dead on arrival
1449880 we expect they will try to delay the case by questioning the jurisdiction of the court but if they see that theyre in trouble we expect them to try and settle out of court
1449881 documents we have refer to ways of increasing the number of yaus in nigeria we have expert testimony that says yaus means young and underage smokers
1449882 we havent got a clue where the government got the amount they are asking for much of what they claim doesnt add up
1449883 it is false to suggest that tobacco companies have had a knee jerk reaction to falling markets elsewhere in the world
1449884 they have something called an 18 plus programme which they say tries to prevent young people from taking up smoking but when 16 and 17 year olds see that it makes them think smoking is grown up its counter productive
1449885 there is a policy of government called the eeg under the policy any nigerian company that produces for export when it remits the money the company is entitled to 30 per cent of your remittance the money is added to your money tobacco companies are importing tobacco leaves into nigeria they are actually importing at 5 duty rate they import at 5 duty rate take it to their factory to process into cigarettes without any duty and their equipment came into the country through zero duty because of the concessions they got under the last administration then they export and are entitled to 30 per cent eeg as grant by the federal government that is the reason why tobacco companies are falling over themselves to have factories in nigeria
1449886 from their own side have confirmed that their staff is 1 100 and that they have plan to employ 100 more let us assume they have employed that 100 that means that their staff strength today is just 1 200
1449887 benefit from the eeg that company must be a nigerian company
1449888 clinicians need to embark on a baseline epidemiological research to know the magnitude of the problem and thereafter update it on a regular basis but the few clinicians are overburdened with clinical work load and there seem not to be adequate funding for research
1449889 the lack of adequate tools and personnel in africa generally has been our bane in terms of research for data it is therefore welcome news that a tool as simple as assist has been developed very user friendly and reasonably sensitive and specific to catch the intended population
1449890 the world health report of 2001 estimated that one in three adults or 1 2 billion people then were smoking and estimate was that by 2025 more than 1 6 million would be smoking and 8 4 million would die from tobacco and its effects
1449891 portend an increase in smoking in some sections of our population
1449892 there is a very strong likelihood that the historically low rates of smoking amongst black african youths particularly girls will begin to rise as society moves toward social and economic equality
1449893 tobacco use is the single most important cause of death and immobility in the world
1449894 the obvious truth behind bat corporate social responsibility campaign is that the efforts were not aimed at achieving social objectives but at achieving the tobacco industrys objectives of operating in an unregulated environment
1449895 it will be unlawful for their directors to allow them to do so
1449896 tobacco corporations have the power to undertake one csr measure that will hugely impact society which is to simply stop selling tobacco surprisingly no tobacco industry has proposed this
1449897 why should you be surprised that bat is still advertising and calling it csr the company claimed that it is giving scholarships to indigent tobacco farmers children i have combed the tobacco growing areas and discovered the real farmers children are not in the universities in fact they are not even in primary schools so where did bat get the students who won the scholarships
1449898 when batn gives out gifts like recently the ford jeep given to the nigeria customs they call a press conference that is the new way they advertise we have been crying that the company advertises to young people i will give you a proof if you do a promotion and the prizes are mobile phones camcorders motor bikes laptop computers who is the industry targeting the 70 year old grandfather
1449899 this is one of the greatest burlesque the industry has pooled on nigeria there is no model farms what you have there is model hardship take a trip up there and see the plight of the farmers they look gaunt and live in the debt bondage that bat has put them they have no hope for redemption and to make matters worse bat has restricted their freedom of expression threatening them with severe consequences if they ever mention their plight to the world
1449900 sixty years is a long time to maintain a relationship i have been able to give my children grandchildren and great grandchildren a good life education and i am very proud of that
1449901 bat cheated me i heard they used the advert all over nigeria and even in america yet i was only paid n40 000
1449902 it is an insult on our national psyche that a company that produces a highly controversial product that also constitutes a high risk to our health and economy is asking for tax waivers it is even more insulting that this is coming at a time every government is increasing tax to discourage smoking
1449903 it is unfortunate that a pack of benson amp hedges which sells for five ponds twenty five pence in the uk and 6 in the us currently sells for just n150 in nigeria it should ordinarily be sold for n1 000
1449904 to implement tax and pricing policies to reduce tobacco consumption
1449905 it is the first time ever that an african state files a suit against a tobacco company no other state in africa has ever done it
1449906 i do not believe that tobacco control is for the usa alone every country where the tobacco industry has created a health crisis has the legal rights to take action and that is what is happening in nigeria
1449907 no tobacco company comes within the first ten of the highest tax payers so really in what ways are they improving the economy and what pathetic legacies are they leaving behind
1449908 i was at the annual general meeting of bat in london this year i joined other advocates from the uk nigeria the usa and canada to protest against bat activities in developing countries akinremi was there as well when we challenged jeffries briginshaw who is the head of international political amp regulatory affairs about the single stick sale in nigeria he denied we showed him the proof a promotional campaign leaflet where bat offers prices for every stick bought he agreed that the company is untruthful and cannot be trusted today bat still sells in single stick
1449909 this is an allegation the government should take seriously i mean this should be investigated
1449910 published a smoking and health booklet that has been made available to all interested stakeholders
1449911 did not say if smokers and passive smokers are included in this category of interested stakeholders it is safe to assume that they are not as 3 000 additional copies would be clearly infinitesimal compared to the number of smokers in nigeria
1449912 it has been established that tobacco currently kills five million people every year i mean the statistics are there for all if the lagos scenario is extrapolated on the entire nation you can imagine the loss we are talking about here
1449913 youre certainly not going to get anywhere without your accreditation
1449914 its what you expect and you feel perfectly safe on the course and inside the village
1449915 theyre very adamant that if you go off site someone needs to accompany you

1449924 additionally the kaletra tablet formulation is a convenient hiv treatment option that can be taken with or without food and does not require refrigeration which is particularly important to patients in the developing world who are disproportionately affected by hiv
1449925 this sub analysis of m05 730 provides additional clinical information on race and gender response with kaletra

1449943 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1449944 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
