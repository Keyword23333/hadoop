3710000 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3710001 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3710002 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3710003 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3710004 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
3710005 georgia has been sticking to its commitments but i dont think there is much to stick to here
3710006 the georgian side must immediately fulfill this key issue to remove all dangers concerning relapses
3710007 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
3710008 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
3710009 this is the first time that weve actually seen an invasion a unilateral invasion of a country
3710010 i think we have to think about this long and hard and deeply in the eu and in nato
3710011 dank guter wege ist die strecke auch f r weniger ge bte wanderer gut zu meistern
3710012 these arrests are a significant development in our fight against the organised criminal gangs responsible for this type of fraud
3710013 to date compromised chip and pin terminals have been found in less than 30 retail outlets throughout the uk together with the banking and retail industries we are working to ensure this figure is minimised
3710014 we are sending a very clear warning to fraudsters these crimes will not be tolerated and that we will continue to target them and disrupt their fraudulent activity
3710015 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3710016 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3710017 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3710018 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3710019 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3710020 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3710021 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3710022 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3710023 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3710024 the higher levels among controls translate into important differences in overall daily functional limitations
3710025 disability and survival curves continued to diverge between groups after the 21 year follow up as participants approached their ninth decade of life
3710026 our findings of decreased disability in addition to prolonged survival among middle aged and older adults participating in routine physical activities further support recommendations to encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity at all ages
3710027 increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors may not only improve length and quality of life but also hopefully lead to reduced health care expenditures associated with disability and chronic diseases
3710028 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3710029 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems it could also ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3710030 we are living in an orwellian world where the russian federation accuses georgia of genocide and ethnic cleansing and meanwhile they are doing it exactly right now there was a temporary ceasefire that was the understanding from this morning there is large scale movement of russian weapons of shooting of armed incidents rampages through different towns and villages of georgia russian troops are in the process of completing ethnic cleansing of all georgian populated areas of abkhazia and south ossetia
3710031 the armed forces of the russian federation which were sent to south ossetia to reinforce our peacekeeping forces they will be withdrawn to russian territory depending on the extent to which the georgian troops go back to their barracks our peacekeepers will remain in south ossetia
3710032 the only change relates to the fact that georgian peacekeepers who were part of the peacekeeping contingent but turned out to be simply traitors and cowards and started shooting at their colleagues of course they are never again going to appear as part of a peacekeeping contingent in south ossetia
3710033 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3710034 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3710035 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3710036 as you know the enclaves of south ossetia previously controlled by the georgian government and by local administration headed by ethnic ossetian dimitri sanakoev has been ethnically cleansed by intruding russian troops and i get very worrying reports some of them look to be unfortunately credible of point blank executions on sight killings some people taken into some kind of camps or some internal places in kurta and vladikavkaz
3710037 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3710038 you know the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery as for claims by the georgian president that the ceasefire has been observed for two days thats a lie georgian forces continued to fire at peacekeepers unfortunately people were killed yesterday there was no ceasefire from the georgian side
3710039 we dont yet have peace but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress
3710040 we want to see the russians stand down what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3710041 russias actions amount to the pre planned cold blooded murder of a country
3710042 they the americans of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shia villages but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they georgian leaders are players that have to be protected
3710043 the ferocity in which the actions of the georgian side were carried out cannot be called anything else but genocide because they acquired a mass character and were directed against individuals the civilian population peacekeepers who carried out their functions of maintaining peace
3710044 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3710045 we are really seeing absolutely unparalleled situation since many many decades in the world this is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine and its very unfortunate that it is happening in my country i insist that its happening unprovoked by us and i insist that it was all pre planned
3710046 regime change is purely an american invention purely an american invention we never apply this terminology in our political thinking and certainly we are all for democracy in georgia and its interesting that our american colleagues chose to bring up publicly this idea of president saakashvili stepping down
3710047 this is 100 unprovoked brutal russian invasion this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders we on our own cannot fight with russia we want an immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
3710048 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
3710049 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
3710050 im deeply concerned about the situation in georgia the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
3710051 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight

3710070 the truth is that in national security terms hes largely untested and untried
3710071 hes never been responsible for policy formulation hes never had leadership in a crisis or in anything larger than his own element on an aircraft carrier or in managing his own congressional staff its not clear that this is going to be the strong suit that he thinks it is mccains weakness is that hes always been for the use of force force and more force in my experience the only time to use force is as a last resort when he talks about throwing russia out of the g8 and makes ditties about bombing iran he betrays a disrespect for the office of the presidency

3710074 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
3710075 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
3710076 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
3710077 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
3710078 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations

3710080 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
3710081 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
3710082 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3710083 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
3710084 the issue with iran is not about uranium enrichment it wants to control the region
3710085 the reason for this is that they do not want people to panic
3710086 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
3710087 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency
3710088 stockpile food and have alternative routes to import food into kuwait
3710089 kuwait would need to procure more trucks for this purpose
3710090 this would require oil tankers equipped to travel in shallow water during the tanker war this was done and proved to be very expensive
3710091 it was successful to maintain the flow of kuwaiti oil but expensive
3710092 powerful forces have historically attempted to control trade via this point
3710093 so they could control traffic through the gulf iran has had this intention since 1971

3710222 die zahl ist nicht wissenschaftlich belegt fest steht allerdings dass der sensor so empfindlich ist dass der k fer den brand aus mehreren kilometern entfernung detektieren kann
3710223 es ist uns aber gelungen der wirkweise dieses sensors der etwa f nfmal schneller als technische infrarot f hler arbeitet n her zu kommen
3710224 die sinneszelle mit der er das tut ist ein typischer mechanorezeptor wie er beispielsweise auch in vielen geh rorganen von insekten etwa bei heuschrecken oder grillen zum einsatz kommt

3710226 das faszinierende an diesem mechanismus ist dass der k fer diese spannungs nderungen schon wenige tausendstel sekunden nach dem infrarot puls registriert

3710383 the government must ensure that the bahamas is for bahamians not a bunch of illiterate illegal foreigners there are already some 80 000 haitians here out of a population of 330 000
3710384 in 10 years there will be more haitians than bahamians in this country it is the duty of the pm and his cabinet to stop this nation turning into a little haiti
3710385 it cannot be in the best interest of either the bahamian government or the bahamian nation to allow a large proportion of its population to live and develop in isolation
3710386 unless the haitian community becomes more fully integrated into bahamian society an important minority of the bahamian born population will grow up as foreigners within the only society they know
3710387 as a result of that legal discrimination you now have an underclass of people who are in fact bahamians except in the legal sense
3710388 they are discriminated against they segregate themselves there is no effort to integrate them into the community and so they feel no connection to us because they are apparently not wanted
3710389 apprehend and deport with no consideration of the needs of the economy small island developing states like the bahamas usually have to import labour if they want to grow we need a policy on how we are going to manage that importation
3710390 one wonders if some important aspects of the migration are due to the unstated policy of the government which encourages co existence rather than integration
3710391 has the government considered the implications of these alternatives and made a conscious informed decision to go for co existence
3710392 longer stay migrants have to be given a stake in the country this does not necessarily imply that they all desire bahamian citizenship but while they reside here they need to be given opportunities to participate and contribute to their full potential
3710393 fundamentally it means acceptance by bahamians that migration is a fact of life for the country and therefore needs to be managed not only efficiently but humanely aspects like bank accounts car licences property ownership and mortgages and schooling all need to be considered essentially this speaks to fair treatment of non nationals who reside legally
3710394 marc applied for the first time for a bahamian passport in 1996 two years before he turned 18 then he applied again after his birthday before trying for a third time in 2001 all he has received to date is notice that the applications have been received since he lacked the passport needed to legitimately open a bank account marc has had to pay someone just to sort out the problem
3710395 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera

3710444 journey has a second life island its not just a fan region they actually commissioned the thing and its good but dont think that its just a marketing piece it was obviously built by people who have a love for the band and put their heart and soul into making the island what it is the main thing youll notice about the island is that all around the edges are displays highlighting each journey album each display is inspired by the album cover and includes a tableau inspired by it the display inspired by their escape album is particularly impressive as the scarab spaceship causes exploding planetary egg debris to fly at you as it escapes naturally its planetary egg prison im sure that made sense in the 80s
3710445 not really no although the guy ive written the book with gavin baddeley is a highly ordained high priest of the church of satan you know when marilyn monroe was a member of the church of satan she used to have a pink and black painted baphomet pendant so i find all this too american for my liking i prefer crowley just because its more english and i can relate to it more than to anton lavey
3710446 no no i certainly dont think he was writing or mumbling he got to the very depth of it and was very intelligent and he might have possibly believed that he had several guardian angels and spirits talking to him and teaching him various things for the book of the law actually a lot of this is written about in our book the gospel of filth we have a huge amount on crowley and the church of satan including an interview with zeena lavey and a very rare interview with anton lavey which was transcribed shortly before his death

3710470 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3710471 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3710472 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3710473 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3710474 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3710476 there is a report coming from bmw about what happened there but the rumour is they havent a clue why it happened they have no idea and that is a worry
3710477 you only need to think about what would happen if someone gets shocked into the fast lane of the pit lane
3710478 it is like a plane crash when you dont get the evidence
3710479 its the flavour of the month but the simple fact is teams will get on top of it
3710480 if you look at the electronic systems they are fairly standard technology which is why people are going for them rather than some of the more involved mechanical type systems that do pose a lot of problems
3710481 the fact is we will get on top of them quickly as soon as one person does the nature of formula one means everyone else has to things like the incident with bmw im sure they are working to understand it but i dont think thatll cause problems it should be straightforward
3710482 certainly the electronic kers were looking at is a fully sealed unit all the high tension cables are within a sealed unit its difficult to see how you can have a problem
3710483 compliance related issues are having a significant impact on meeting planning teams

3710500 last year i replaced all the windows in my house with that expensive double pane energy efficient kind and today i got a call from the contractor who installed them he was complaining that the work had been completed a whole year ago and i still hadnt paid for them
3710501 i didn t know i was that close to equaling the record of racing at gp events
3710502 my next target will be to make 300 but the only important thing to me is that i am competitive and fighting with the best guys
3710503 brno has been a successful track for me and one i really like to race at i won there in 2006 and would really like to do that again
3710504 i think the gsv r will be well suited to the track and we will be very competitive there my arm is still very sore and it is not 100 perfect but it is getting stronger every day and i really hope that it will not trouble me too much during the weekend
3710505 we finished the first half of the season with good rewards from our efforts and i am sure we can continue that momentum at brno i got a good result there last year after a hard battle with loris and the suzuki gsv r was on the podium as well with john hopkins on board so it all looks good for a strong performance from the whole garage
3710506 we also have a test after the race when we have a new bike featuring chassis and engine developments we have a lot of confidence and high hopes for the changes and i m looking forward to see how all our thoughts and ideas will translate on the track but the main thing is the race and i am fully focused on keeping my podium run going
3710507 niemand kan zich de eerste dagen anders voordoen dan hij of zij is en dat zorgt gelijk voor een enorme teamspirit maar voor hoe lang heerst deze spirit en kun je daarmee bergen verzetten
3710508 ill keep fighting for a podium or even a victory this year because that will prove that im still here
3710509 i want to prove to everybody that im still the best so i need a super performance to do that which means a podium or a win
3710510 and ill be trying to do it in the second part of the season
3710511 there was a bit of frustration when i saw that i wouldnt win races or get on the podium
3710512 but its still a challenge to beat our main opponents and thats the motivation to keep doing my best
3710513 ive not had the best of seasons but i am pretty happy with this
3710514 ive got a good set up in both the dry and now the wet so i cant wait to get going in these races

3710519 it is important to note that the hedging loss for the quarter was non cash and does not necessarily reflect the expected future cash settlement value of the contracts
3710520 as of june 30 the oil hedged represents less than one third of enterras oil production and therefore any actual cash cost of these hedges will be more than offset by higher prices received on the non hedged production
3710521 the managed server market has lagged in developing and delivering on demand managed hosting solutions with truly differentiated feature sets demand for next generation advancements in non virtualized physical hosting environments has gone unsatisfied until now with ironscale

3710525 there is an enormous amount of potential growth out there for us
3710526 based on focusing our pv mosfet drivers in pursuit of the billion unit per year mosfet marketplace and every one of them needs some means of turning it on amp off or driving it a mosfet
3710527 is a power transistor that is typically used in motor control or switching applications and whether the mosfet is controlling a motor in a windshield wiper or is part of an automated aircraft electronic test system there is just no safer way to drive it the laws of physics actually guarantee that a photovoltaic pv device is simply the most reliable way to drive or control a mosfet
3710528 and our near term goal is to make the marketplace more aware of our advantages although there will also be both financial and technical challenges involved with increasing our production rates and reducing our manufacturing costs the prospect of possibly boosting our annual sales volume to 25 million representing just one percent of the available market makes the struggle worth while after all
3710529 we invented the pv mosfet driver many years ago and continued all these years improving its performance now that the market has grown to huge proportions and we are again healthy enough for the challenge we are determined to concentrate our efforts there and aggressively face up to that challenge

3710625 fujimoto and matsuura are the only people i can have a decent conversation with everybodys so conservative and uptight that i have to wear this damn tie just to meet with them
3710626 anyway business is a mans world they say when ayaya was elected president i thought ayaka was lying when she told me
3710627 well apparently one of the younger board members whats her name
3710628 well lets just say i no a lot of people find it difficult to communicate with her sometimes anyway hopefully matsuuras managed to buy them all off im hoping for a small crowd from their conglomerate today
3710629 how come its only ayumi who gets called by a nickname i want to be called a nickname too
3710630 well youre names too short if she does call you maichin shell have to say one more syllable more effort on her part and you know yoshiko told us not to let her strain herself in anything
3710631 anyway i dont mind being called my name at least she calls me by my name right rika chan
3710632 sniff rika chan you smell different today sniff sniff have you been sleeping in yoshikos room
3710633 no doubt ive done her laundry enough to memorize the scent of that room

3710637 remember she only gave rika keys to the flat after a week
3710638 dont worry about a thing rika chan thats nothing to yoshiko im pretty sure she wanted to give you more but i know youre not the receiving type and she knows that too so she gave you the least possible thats bearable to her conscience
3710639 ayaka she just had about a hundred dandelions shipped from japan yesterday
3710640 ishikawas daughter is in the philippines and has made a 10 million us dollar investment in matsuuras company
3710641 sniff rika chan you smell different today sniff sniff have you been sleeping in yoshikos room

3710646 yeah itll be fun come on the host is right ahead
3710647 i think this is a mistake we could get into real trouble
3710648 the only trouble we might get into is if reinas dad found out we were patronizing a place other than one of those her family owns
3710649 ill just tell daddy i was checking out the competition
3710650 getting into an upright position when she saw reina pouring assiduously over the menu the dark haired maiden asked in a low voice
3710651 are you two done with that yet im feeling a little hungry i guess i could do with some food
3710652 oh my god eri i knew you were innocent but this this is too much
3710653 eririn the menu is for picking out who you want to accompany you for the night for example if you happened to take a fancy to the host who showed us in you could pick him he was rather cute that chinese accent was kinda sexy
3710654 accompany me why would i want to be accompanied wait dont tell me this is what i think it is
3710655 bingo this is a host club host clubs have been around for more than four decades the first one reportedly opened in tokyo in 1966

3710658 i dont want her to get a hangover the next day i can tell shes a newbie

3710685 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3710824 if talks about cooperation with the independence party were to arise i believe that it should be taken into serious consideration so that the issues facing the city would not be upset
3710825 i trust skar bergsson chairman of the progressive party in reykjav k city and his people to examine the possibility carefully
3710826 being the third wheel is not an option if this majority is broken it is finished and it is useless trying to fix or improve it
3710827 i cannot comment on things that i know nothing about but to my knowledge the cooperation with magn sson is going fine
3710828 these issues are in the custody of our party in the city council and i am neither going to tell it what to do nor express specific opinions about it
3710829 i trust our people and our new leader in the city hanna birna kristj nsd ttir to regain support for us
3710830 a long career in politics has taught me not to worry too much about fluctuation of support in polls because it is difficult to decipher them
3710831 the closed rhinoplasty is nearly a lost art it is significantly more difficult for the surgeon to learn and demands a steeper longer learning curve than the open approach
3710832 i can perform rhinoplasty either through a closed or open approach however i reserve the open rhinoplasty approach for only very special circumstances in most primary rhinoplasty or majority of beverly hills revision rhinoplasty patients i believe that the experienced surgeon should have the capability to perform rhinoplasty through the closed approach which is how i perform the majority of my cases i have seen too many scars underneath the nose that do not heal properly as a result of the open rhinoplasty technique if these scars do not heal well it is extremely difficult to correct them and they can potentially remain permanently visible
3710833 in practicality it can also be problematic since the open technique can in some cases cause significantly more scarring skin shrinkage and long term unpredictability than the closed techniques
3710834 this victory is a positive sign of us being a good team
3710835 it was an amazing victory because it is not every day that we beat the world champion at the olympics it doesnt get much sweeter than this
3710836 i am very satisfied with how we played and except for the beginning everything worked out as planned the fight went great we were aggressive and they couldnt handle it

3710838 now theyve started letting them out of the bus in front of our house
3710839 if were about to leave and someone yells star tours you hit the ground if you go down they cant see you
3710840 theyre complaining about the tour buses and the paparazzi theyre both things that we cannot help
3710841 the knife almost penetrated my lung i dont know what would have happened if it had gone all the way i also got cuts on my arm
3710842 but im certain that i was not provoking them i have never done that and i wasnt drunk either i began talking to a group of boys on laugavegur when things heated up i ran down ing lfsstraeti they caught me at the crossing and attacked me
3710843 i doubt that people do such things because they dislike foreigners i wouldnt say that icelanders are racists i do however believe that there are men who go looking for fights when they are under the influence of drugs and then foreigners are easier targets since they dont have a network of contacts as big as the natives have
3710844 if i miss my stuff ill just come to your place to visit it
3710845 i am master of this house and you will do just as i say first you will cook me the finest gourmet dinner then you will go to the off licence and buy me the finest bottle of scotch you can find you will come home and pour me a generous measure which i will drink while i am watching the football on tv then you will go upstairs and run me a bath which i will take before going to bed where we will have the wildest sex ever during which you will fulfill my wildest fantasies then tomorrow guess who is going to wash me and comb my hair

3710852 wir haben keine rezession und sollten die konsolidierung weiter betreiben
3710853 in der jetzigen situation halte ich ein konjunkturprogramm f r nicht sinnvoll
3710854 eigentlich keine konjunkturprogramme sondern andere politische ma nahmen die man verfolgt und von denen man sich jetzt verspricht sie leichter durchsetzen zu k nnen dass man ihnen auch noch das m ntelchen der konjunkturstimulierung umwirft
3710855 bevor die zielmarke wieder in greifbare n he kommt ist sicherlich hinsichtlich der ezb keine politik nderung angesagt
3710856 grunds tzlich dagegen dass man mit der finanzpolitik versucht die konjunktur zu st tzen
3710857 es gibt sehr wenig belege daf r dass die finanzpolitik systematisch wirkt
3710858 ich h tte gro e bedenken wie man unter den deutschen gesetzlichen rahmenbedingungen berhaupt ein programm schneidern kann dass der konjunktur hilft
3710859 politiker k nnten sich sagen wenn wir das ohnehin auf der agenda haben machen wir es doch jetzt um einen konjunkturellen nebeneffekt zu haben

3710881 weve got a couple of big series coming up that are taking up most of our thinking at the moment but were certainly very aware that in 12 months well have an ashes series on the go and were very much looking forward to it
3710882 i actually think those 12 test matches will give us a fantastic opportunity to see how we want to play with a real eye towards the ashes
3710883 without wanting to put too much on paper i reckon it is interesting that hes coming out and saying that already
3710884 there are obviously some things they need to work on it was a dead rubber and if they want to win the ashes theyve got to win two more tests than they won in this series against us in england next year

3710958 besides the areas of counter terrorism and border security current cooperation between the european union and the us includes the fight against international crime cybercrime drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings as to data protection our common goals are clear to protect our citizens security by making sure law enforcement authorities have the information they need to do their work and to protect our citizens fundamental rights and privacy
3710959 russia is together with the us our main strategic partner in the field of justice freedom and security
3710960 at the same time the group holds that the fight against terrorism itself has to make the most efficient and pro active use of the internet with the aim of de radicalisation cultural intelligence needs to fight radicalisation over the internet and the media thereby especially taking into consideration the special characteristics of cyber language
3710961 in the digital tsunami environment the traditional measures to protect privacy will become less and less effective unless appropriate technological measures are used as an essential complement to legal means
3710962 no russian peacekeepers or any troops have been sent to gori

3710964 this means they will have to walk one metre plus nine inches
3710965 i have to have the wheels of the wheelie bin protruding onto the pavement so they can see the bin has to be collected
3710966 the compromise is that i push it out so the driver and his mate can see it but it will not block the pavement
3710967 they will now have to walk an extra nine inches to get my bin i have been given special dispensation
3710968 i was told twigs and leaves could fall out onto the operatives and cause serious injuries
3710969 we make every effort to collect bins in all sorts of circumstances we have a very satisfactory and comprehensive refuse service
3710970 i am quite satisfied we are doing the best we can to facilitate the best collection of rubbish we can in west wiltshire
3710971 these really are the big boys they are absolutely the best but they are extremely secretive and cloak and dagger about what they do
3710972 the army and security forces will not be terrorised by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that
3710973 i see this within a spate of attacks against the army that could be reprisal attacks for the armys crushing of fatah al islam last year

3710981 if investigations will be done with the presumption that the abductees are alive and not dead then we will be entering a new phase there is ample possibility that survivors will be found
3710982 with that as a leverage north korea is due to move
3710983 the next step will be to wait for north korea to set up its reinvestigation committee and notify us when they have done so
3710984 of course that was progress we are now moving toward action for action although we are still not there yet
3710985 in the overall picture the ratio of importance of the abduction issue and this is below 99 to 1
3710986 it was good that a step forward was made for japan it wasnt perfect but i hold strong hopes that negotiations between japan and north korea will deepen
3710987 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3710988 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3710989 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
3710990 a journalist in action was killed by idf fire along with others not involved in the hostilities
3710991 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehavior i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3710992 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3710993 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3710994 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable

3711027 kurangnya minat generasi muda dan kurangnya menasional lagu lagu daerah banjar salah satu faktornya karena kurang promosi
3711028 dengan promisi melalui segala potensi media yang ada maka seni budaya daerah banjar tak akan sirna bahkan bisa makin tumbuh dan berkembang lebih pesat serta maju sejajar dengan seni budaya daerah lain

3711030 la mia vita e monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio percio ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita sara illuminata conoscero un rumore di passi che sara diverso da tutti gli altri gli altri passi mi fanno nascondere sotto terra il tuo mi fara uscire dalla tana come una musica e poi guarda vedi laggiu in fondo dei campi di grano io non mangio il pane e il grano per me e inutile i campi di grano non mi ricordano nulla e questo e triste ma tu hai dei capelli color delloro allora sara meraviglioso quando mi avrai addomesticato il grano che e dorato mi fara pensare a te e amero il rumore del vento nel grano
3711031 ma non ho molto tempo pero ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
3711032 gli uomini non hanno piu tempo per conoscere nulla comprano dai mercanti le cose gia fatte ma siccome non esistono mercanti di amici gli uomini non hanno piu amici se tu vuoi un amico addomesticami
3711033 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cosi nellerba io ti guardero con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po piu vicino
3711034 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincero ad essere felice col passare dellora aumentera la mia felicita quando saranno le quattro incomincero ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scopriro il prezzo della felicita ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapro mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
3711035 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore ce un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il giovedi ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il giovedi e un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
3711036 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
3711037 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua e unica al mondo quando ritornerai a dirmi addio ti regalero un segreto
3711038 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
3711039 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico ed ora e per me unica al mondo
3711040 non si puo morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi rassomigli ma lei lei sola e piu importante di tutte voi perche e lei che ho innaffiata perche e lei che ho messa sotto la campana di vetro perche e lei che ho riparata col paravento perche su di lei ho uccisi i bruchi salvo i due o tre per le farfalle perche e lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perche e la mia rosa
3711041 ecco il mio segreto e molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale e invisibile agli occhi
3711042 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cosi importante
3711043 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
3711044 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verita ma tu non la devi dimenticare tu diventi responsabile per sempre di quello che hai addomesticato tu sei responsabile della tua rosa

3711147 a missionary is someone sent by jesus christ just as he was sent by god the great controlling factor is not the needs of people but the command of jesus the source of our inspiration in our service for god is behind us not ahead of us the tendency today is to put the inspiration out in front to sweep everything together in front of us and make it conform to our definition of success but in the new testament the inspiration is put behind us and is the lord jesus himself the goal is to be true to him to carry out his plans
3711148 where does my source of inspiration come from is it in the service of god or in the service of men

3711161 deploying femtocells requires a good understanding of market segmentation of both mobile consumer and household markets meticulous planning and targeted marketing campaigns which mean operators will have to invest substantial amount of money if they want femtocell services to gain popularity
3711162 if femtocells are sold to customers in sporadic fashion via traditional mobile operators channels then this may induce a huge scattering of femtocell deployment over large areas not only will this make it hard to manage faps femtocell access points and related networks but most importantly this would mean the operator will not be able to make any capex capital expenditure or opex operational expenditure savings

3711177 hoorde u hoe de toonhoogte halverwege wat zakte en aan het einde weer omhoogging
3711178 de mensen willen graag autoruiten die aan de bovenkant een beetje bol staan dat ziet er mooier uit het gevolg is wel dat de ruit halverwege een beetje klem in de sponning komt te zitten en er pas aan het eind weer mooi inpast de elektromotor voor de raambediening moet dus in het midden harder werken en zakt iets in toerental en in toonhoogte constructief gezien is dat geen enkel probleem maar de klant krijgt de indruk dat die motor het maar n t trekt en dat is strijdig met het beeld dat ze van een bmw hebben
3711179 na het uiterlijk van een auto is het geluid het eerste dat een aspirant koper opvalt de betrouwbaarheid de veiligheid en de milieuvriendelijkheid zijn ook allemaal belangrijke factoren maar een nieuwe klant die een proefrit maakt merkt daar niets van je moet hem pakken met het uiterlijk met styling en met geluid
3711180 wij ontwerpen geluiden die niet authentiek zijn maar die de klanten voor authentiek houden
3711181 een autodeur is van dun plaatstaal gemaakt hij is maar 0 7 mm dik heel normaal dat je een blikkerig geluid krijgt als je die dichtslaat maar een bmw rijder verwacht een solide klik dus wij monteren antidreun matten en we passen de constructie van het portierslot aan
3711182 aanvankelijk was geluid vooral iets wat bestreden moest worden bijvoorbeeld bij stofzuigers ze maken nu veel minder geluid dan vroeger
3711183 als een stofzuiger heel stil is denken de mensen dat die niet werkt
3711184 hoe een apparaat eruitziet is het eerste beslissende moment maar het tweede komt als je de stekker in het stopcontact steekt en hoort welk geluid het maakt het team dat het senseo koffiezetapparaat heeft ontworpen kwam er pas laat achter dat het apparaat niet goed klonk te goedkoop ze hebben er net zo lang aan gesleuteld tot het wel goed klonk
3711185 denk maar aan de klappen die een harley davidson motorfiets maakt het is een belangrijk deel van de identiteit van dat merk maar ze kunnen met geluid ook informatie overdragen een bliepje dat je vertelt dat je een toets van je telefoon goed hebt ingedrukt een reeks piepjes als je de veiligheidsgordels niet omdoet of met het opgewekte plieng als de magnetron klaar is met je eten dat moet allemaal ontworpen worden
3711186 een luxe personenwagen moet zijdezacht lopen een sportwagen mag best wat rauwer klinken en bij een suv moet je de indruk krijgen dat die zich door elke modderpoel heen kan werken we kunnen al die geluiden nu op de computer simuleren en op die manier beslissen hoe een nieuwe auto moet gaan klinken
3711187 het is alleen wel jammer dat hoe zuiniger je een motor maakt des te rauwer hij gaat klinken daar is niet zo veel aan te doen
3711188 we zijn er al lang mee bezig we hebben al heel vroeg de cd laatjes zo gemaakt dat ze soepel klinken en geen plastic geratel produceren
3711189 toen de philips whirlpool wasmachines werden uitgerust met antigeluid een voorziening die door het produceren van geluid in tegenfase hinderlijk geluid kan onderdrukken kregen we veel wasmachines terug met kapot gerukte handels de machines waren zo stil geworden dat de mensen dachten dat ze het niet deden
3711190 ik rijd in een toyota prius en als je op een parkeerterrein manoeuvreert horen de mensen je niet want dat doet hij op zijn elektromotor ik heb al een paar keer gehad dat voetgangers schrokken omdat ze mijn auto niet hadden opgemerkt blijkbaar houd je er onbewust rekening mee dat je oren je wel zullen waarschuwen
3711191 its a huge compliment to be asked to do that and it was really amazing to be taken seriously

3711200 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3711201 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3711202 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3711203 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3711204 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3711205 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3711206 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3711207 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3711208 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3711209 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3711210 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3711211 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3711215 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3711230 the dhcp server does not check this it will happily dynamically allocate
3711231 the dhcp server checks ip addresses to see if they are in use before allocating them to clients it does this by sending an icmp echo request message to the ip address being allocated if no icmp echo reply is received within a second the address is assumed to be free this is only done for leases that have been specified in range statements and only when the lease is thought by the dhcp server to be free i e the dhcp server or its failover peer has not listed the lease as in use if a response is received to an icmp echo request the dhcp server assumes that there is a configuration error the ip address is in use by some host on the network that is not a dhcp client it marks the address as abandoned and will not assign it to clients
3711232 its often useful to allocate a single address to a single client in approximate perpetuity host statements with fixed address clauses exist to a certain extent to serve this purpose but because host statements are intended to approximate static configuration they suffer from not being referenced in a littany of other server services such as dynamic dns failover on events and so forth if a standard dynamic lease as from any range statement is marked reserved then the server will only allocate this lease to the client it is identified by be that by client identifier or hardware address in practice this means that the lease follows the normal state engine enters active state when the client is bound to it expires or is released and any events or services that would normally be supplied during these events are processed normally as with any other dynamic lease the only difference is that failover servers treat reserved leases as special when they enter the free or backup states each server applies the lease into the state it may allocate from and the leases are not placed on the queue for allocation to other clients instead they may only be found by client identity the result is that the lease is only offered to the returning client

3711680 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3711681 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3711682 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3711683 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern

3711712 the aa has conducted numerous research projects into the effects of alcohol on driving and without exception each one has proven that drivers are already significantly impaired at the 0 05 percent limit
3711713 we are concerned that this limit is inappropriate in south africa where one is 14 times more likely to die in a traffic crash than in the usa
3711714 the aa fully agrees with the 0 02 percent limit for professional drivers
3711715 this allows some leeway for medications which contain alcohol but still emphasises that one alcoholic drink puts you over the limit the mixed message of having a different limit for ordinary drivers is impeding the fight against drunkenness on our roads
3711716 the more risk factors we can eliminate from the roads the safer theyll become

3711806 you dont know what people are going to throw at you so youve really got to throw it out there and see whats going to happen

3711818 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3711819 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3711820 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat

3711903 quando h evid ncia suficiente para acusar algu m de um crime n s iniciamos vigorosamente um processo
3711904 mas nem todo erro ou mesmo toda viola o da lei crime
3711905 isso n o significa como est o dizendo que os oficiais que cometeram o delito n o sofreram conseq ncias
3711906 longe disso os oficiais diretamente implicados no delito deixaram o departamento na companhia de uma notoriedade substancialmente negativa
3711907 seu comportamento impr prio foi exposto pelo departamento de justi a para que todos o vissem
3711908 duvido que algu m nesta sala queira trocar de lugar com qualquer uma dessas pessoas

3711917 i felt fine just like the last few times out
3711918 i wanted to mix in more changeups i threw some in counts that i normally wouldnt throw them in but we decided to go with it because i wanted to get a few more in
3711919 overall i felt pretty good i havent felt the rib his ninth rib since i was in tampa fla its kind of a long process but its good to be back and throwing the ball pretty well obviously things didnt go real well up there at the beginning of the year im sure they want to see me prove myself down here again so however many starts they feel that is ill roll with it
3711920 i thought chad moeller did a real nice job with him using all his pitches
3711921 there were a few occasions where he threw his breaking ball behind in the count and he threw it for strikes he mixed his changeup in well
3711922 its another pitch to keep hitters on their toes you cant sit back and look fastball against phil because he had the good breaking ball going when you change something front to back like that with the changeup it puts a third pitch in the hitters minds and can keep him off balance
3711923 i guess my next outing will be around 90 plus pitches
3711924 from that aspect i feel ready to go and physically i feel fine

3712182 when it comes to catwalking every designer requires a different strut the gucci step is punchy with lots of energy and rhythm in contrast to a chanel stride which is slower paced more elegant and relaxed
3712183 imaging a pole running vertically up your spine extending through your head and pulling you up roll your shoulders back and down keep them parallel to the floor and always relaxed
3712184 if you are having difficulty balancing try swinging your arms slightly to help centre yourself
3712185 keep legs close together and as straight as possible imagine a straight line in front of you and walk to it keep each step slightly elongated and placed in front of the other
3712186 if you have larger legs avoid t straps or ankle straps wide heels and round or square toes as these styles can visually enlarge and widen the appearance of the foot

3712193 sometimes i say shes not my sister other times i say ive stuffed her in my suitcase and sent it to dubai
3712194 i read that jordan said id never really look like her as her look is unique
3712195 well id like to know when hair extensions fake t ts and fake tan became unique because its every other girl on the street
3712196 the whole world doesnt revolve around her and she needs to realise that
3712197 shes also said big boobs are out of fashion but even after her reduction her boobs are still bigger than mine so yes shes right big boobs are out of fashion
3712198 the thing that gets me is people always used to say that jordan wanted to look like pamela anderson but you dont see pammi shouting the odds
3712199 i recently saw this magazine called j magazine that just came out however the pictures used of me inside its pages are two years old

3712212 he is just another person but maybe from another planet
3712213 its a big relief its good to see we won this game its good to see the bullpen performing well i trust everybody and tonight they did a good job
3712214 well thats thing about the national league you never know whats going to happen out there i was told that murphy would hit and if we get a couple of runs id get that at bat and continue pitching that wasnt the case though and so brian pinch hit but i was ready you know for either call it turned out to be a good call
3712215 i felt pretty good tonight i threw some pitches that stayed up in the strikezone my change up wasnt right it wasnt the best tonight but i was able to stay in the game battle and throw the right pitch
3712216 es gibt derzeit kein stadtportal in europa das user interaktion zul sst bei uns in hamburg darf man erstmals nicht nur informationen lesen sondern kann sich auch selbst beteiligen das ist ein meilenstein

3712218 i dont know what happened i thought my feet were under me and next thing i know i was on my back
3712219 that it was going to lead to a lot of injuries
3712220 you have to do a bigger variety of difficult skills now
3712221 in our era you could do one or two difficult moves then fill out the rest of your routine with things you are comfortable doing now you have to be a freak of nature to be able to do a world class routine
3712222 everybody knows how rock solid chellsie is and definitely on floor also she had a chance to perform because we all remember what kind of routine she did at the trials
3712223 we throw some of the hardest skills on the floor
3712224 we are built of the strongest legs in the world and we love to fly we love to tumble really hard honestly we do have a problem stepping out of bounds
3712225 i have no proof so i cannot say they are underage
3712226 if that is true which it possibly could be because one of the little girls has a missing tooth then it is totally unfair because it doesnt give an even playing field for people all over the world
3712227 it is great for the club that me and emily will be there and i hope that we can do well for our supporters and inspire other athletes
3712228 its so exciting to be going to the olympics and it is a proud moment for me my family will be there and i am counting down the days at the moment
3712229 whether i win a gold medal or come last as long as i come home knowing that i did my best i will be happy
3712230 big championships spur me on to try to jump higher and win medals
3712231 you have to try not to get overwhelmed by it all you conduct yourself in the same way as you would anywhere else
3712232 the qualifying rounds are ok because you are not competing against each other but the build up to the final is like waiting to get onto a ride at alton towers
3712233 i was delighted with how it went at the weekend but i think i ran within myself a little and i feel that i can push on more
3712234 i have to be realistic about my aims in beijing but it is a massive challenge and i want to raise my game and beat my personal best
3712235 abi oyepitan ran 22 56s in the athens 200m semi final four years ago and reached the final so i will go out to beat my best and see what happens
3712236 there are a few little things that i want to work on before the olympics ive got to make sure that i relax and keep my shoulders down
3712237 but i have to go out there treat each round as just another race and that way i can hopefully focus on my own performance
3712238 i was there or thereabouts for a while and i was stuck with the same personal best time i messed up at the world championships in osaka last year and i wanted to prove to myself and others that i could do it
3712239 giving up my job was scary at first and had to wait for a while before i received any funding but i was determined to make it work
3712240 i will be running in the 200m and the relay in london and then concentrating on practice
3712241 the injuries to jessica ennis and mark lewis francis have been really disappointing but there are good youngsters like alex nelson coming through
3712242 competition will be hard in beijing but i think we have good medal hopes in the likes of phillips idowu and kelly sotherton
3712243 me encanta el f tbol me encanta messi es un gran jugador
3712244 i wish i had asked for my day in court rather than accepted a police caution that way i could have explained that i was trying to do what was right for my daughter
3712245 jess isnt bad but some of the 13 year olds who live here do use drugs and drink and i dont want that path for her
3712246 i did deserve the slapping because of the things id been doing
3712247 i was expecting my dad to come home from the police station and for everything to be the same as before
3712248 when an offence is admitted the offender is always liable to receive a caution
3712249 had the offence not been admitted officers would have pursued the matter with the cps
3712250 she has family members with her at the beijing hospital and shes able to interact with them during brief visits several times a day
3712251 hugh and elisabeth and other family members who have come to beijing since the tragedy this past saturday are with her
3712252 we dont think it is going to have any effect on the olympic games itself
3712253 we should not have any greater threat on any delegations at the games
3712254 go on eyes firmly fixed on the present and the future and not to linger in the past
3712255 hold on stop and pray theres no movement inside the trench the enemy doesnt look so mean when christmas fires are lit just for one moment just for one night we can be we can be side by side
3712256 because we can see wolverine and sabertooth fight side by side and talking to each
3712257 because both of their memories have been tampered with obviously but the description sounds sweet and i cannot wait for the clip to hit the web im skeptical about emma supposedly being in this film shes an even bigger character than gambit and it seems weird marvel wouldnt want to save her for a potential x4 film but well see deadpool better be spot on however sans breaking the fourth wall as it wouldnt make sense in a movie maybe just a little direct glance at the camera and a wink or something alike http www omelete com br cine 100014033 x men origins wolverine aspx i can see putting gambit and the blob in the movie since with the x men you can change their ages like they did with x men evolution but emma i mean if they want to put emma in a movie then they should make an x4 not through her into the wolvie movie http i276 photobucket com albums kk36 untiltied vlcsnap 1274427 png http i276 photobucket com albums kk36 untiltied vlcsnap 1277815 png http i276 photobucket com albums kk36 untiltied vlcsnap 1278028 png thanks jc the pics were ok gambit doesnt look all that good his eyes arent black and red the chick that seems to be the white queen really needs to have the signature outfit on the blob looks like fat bastard and the biggest let dow was ryan reynolds deadpool pics he does not have the mask i hope that when they say this is unfinished footage of the film they mean their really going to go back and add some black and red to gambits eyes and fix deadpool and give him a mask or something im a little neutral on this now sabretooth just talk and they do the same just half hour late hey miss t tell me what is sabertooth
3712258 fox this could possibly be the tentative title for the planned young x men spin off or something new entirely
3712259 the x men first class title is currently used in an ongoing comic book series from marvel comics the publication chronicles the beginning years of the first x men team which consist of cyclops jean angel iceman and beast
3712260 do fans agree or disagree with this film to be made or not
3712261 im attached to it im also supposed to write and direct one of the x men spin off movies for fox but thats not a marvel film its not a pure marvel movie its a fox thing
3712262 yeah its like a young x men its a pretty cool idea actually i cant sell you the whole idea but it involves a younger group of x men at the beginning
3712263 it is a little bit more of getting back to the classic x men
3712264 cmix you mean like an x men first class kind of thing zp it is a little bit like that i dont want to give away the concept of it but it is a good idea
3712265 im also supposed to write and direct one of the x men spin off movies for fox
3712266 cmix one of the x men spin off movies any one in particular zp yeah its like a young x men its a pretty cool idea actually i cant sell you the whole idea but it involves a younger group of x men at the beginning
3712267 we dont know ok we all dont know what their thinking about or what their choice ok
3712268 it is still on the processing form or early form early stage of it before the pre production of the film your talking about its finally been decided
3712269 just that from what i read it didnt sound like you knew the meaning of the word
3712270 p o s s i b i l t y
3712271 im just voicing out my opinion and maybe opinions of others who like to see new movies of some sort ok
3712272 i stop a day ago and telling anthony that im sorry
3712273 she was just explaining why she felt that the name calling was not called for
3712274 so hopefully this will be the last we hear of this
3712275 i can say it hes sexy right hes a little bit like a junior wolverine in a way hes a little bit of a wise guy hes an outsider hes got some issues himself hes mischievous hes cheeky hes a bit of a badass we have a really great fight sequence physically that guy is an animal he was chucking himself around on the concrete he has that passion that i remember having when i first did wolverine there was no way a stunt double was doing anything for him
3712276 we were so thrilled to get ryan hes the greatest guy incredibly funny he plays deadpool the merc with a mouth not an easy guy to play hes always jabbering hes always going physically hes in unbelievable shape and yet hes also got that comedic ability there are only a handful of actors that can do that
3712277 somebody call 911 quick it seem that she has geekgasmed to death
3712278 che le donne siano migliori degli uomini non posso dirlo per posso sicuramente dire che non sono peggiori
3712279 my prayer for all of them is that they will be one just as you and i are one father that just as you are in me and i am in you so they will be in us and the world will believe you sent me
3712280 i have given them the glory you gave me so that they may be one as we are i in them and you in me all being perfected into one then the world will know that you sent me and will understand that you love them as much as you love me
3712281 the pope has a cat he loves a lot so why doesnt he use it for one of his capes
3712282 anything that improves the transparency of house prices is good and its always been the case that new build properties have been highly priced with a premium
3712283 its a native species so were trying to restore it
3712284 then theres the research aspect there might be some human benefits from them down the road that we dont know about yet
3712285 my left arm went numb my chest felt tight and i got reeeeal dizzy luckily i collapsed near a hollow stump in a shady area once i heard the soothing hiss of that there rattle i knew everything was gonna be alllll right
3712286 members of worldwide industrial have requested we provide more solutions to help them reach their target market generate trade leads and increase their customer base
3712287 the site now provides live rfqs from companies in need of tooling machining casting and molding metal fabricating extrusions industrial design rapid prototyping and other custom manufacturing services suppliers will find a wide range of trade leads from both buyers and suppliers of industrial goods and custom manufactured parts and components
3712288 quality trade leads have always played a significant role in business especially in todays highly competitive b2b marketplace
3712289 open rfqs from pre qualified buyers are unquestionably the most effective tread leads of all because the company is ready to buy now
3712290 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3712291 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3712292 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3712293 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3712294 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3712295 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3712296 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the us deal on its own with some of the issues
3712297 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3712298 she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
3712299 we said be smart about this dont go in and dont fall for the russian provocation do not do this
3712300 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country
3712301 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3712302 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3712303 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3712304 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3712305 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3712306 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3712307 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong

3712310 we are going to have the largest digital fireworks display the world has ever seen

3712343 the use of psychic spies may still be happening today most recently by the 1990s it was revealed that the pentagon continued to employ a highly classified team of psychic spies who use a form of remote viewing to aid in the gathering of intelligence in foreign countries
3712344 my psychic gift started to show itself in my senior year of high school in 1961 and developed into almost perfect ability to talk to other psychics mostly those in the intelligence community by the summer of 1966
3712345 this type of industry support certainly bolsters our belief that the time for the us bx is now

3712348 the poems were originally written on old sheets of paper and napkins which i hung on to for many years reading my own words during that period of my life often helped me envision a better future for the world and myself it is extremely exciting to bring these poems to life with bruno linares brilliant musical accompaniment

3712377 the tone is clearly dovish with the economy now expected broadly to stagnate over the next year or so
3712378 against that background we stick to the view that interest rates will eventually fall very sharply once inflation pressures finally recede market rate expectations therefore have scope to fall much further in time
3712379 with real policy rates in the region set to fall both economies are likely to see a more protracted spell of high inflation a risk that will be exacerbated if the trade term gains over the past years are to reverse course going forward
3712380 another challenge will come from potential adjustments in external balance in reaction to lower real returns on the regions financial assets that could undermine the supply of foreign funding to the domestic financial sectors

3712417 cu toate acestea managementul oltchim a constituit o companie separata in care oltchim sa nu este actionar
3712418 in timp ce situatia financiara a oltchim s a deteriorat continuu in ultimii ani si in prezent oltchim se afla in pericol de a intra in faliment managementul oltchim nu face niciun pas in directia restructurarii companiei a achizitiei de materii prime de baza si a dezvoltarii companiei
3712419 in acelasi timp roibu si echipa manageriala prin infiintarea unei companii separate si 100 private dezvaluie ca prin folosirea resurselor oltchim a numelui companiei si a know how ului sunt orientati nicidecum spre binele celor aproape 4 400 de angajati ai oltchim ci spre interesul privat al celor 8 persoane

3712462 we cannot find anyone how they were evacuated and what happened there is a mystery to us
3712463 georgian forces have begun their pullback toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3712464 russian occupying forces are continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3712465 if saakashvili had not been armed up to the teeth he would never have made such a decision
3712466 georgia should not have intervened in south ossetian capital tskhinvali in such an ill prepared manner this was a grave mistake
3712467 the situation is extremely tense and very complicated what happens next is uncertain i hope that the talks of president saakashvili with his western partners will lead to an end to the conflict
3712468 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3712469 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3712470 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3712471 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more

3712476 q and mr chapman have you given thought in those long twenty years as to whats behind all of this and why you were so possessed with doing such harm to this person who for all of us having read about this was doing no harm to whatsoever on your life or your you at all had no livelihood have you given thought to that a yes i have q why you had to single this guy out a i was feeling like i was worthless and maybe the root of it is a self esteem issue i felt like nothing and i felt if i shot him i would become something which is not true at all q mm hmm a but thats why i shot mr lennon q and him in particular because he was someone that you admired or you locked at him and his stature and you thought this would have some impact on your life sir a well i originally what happened was i was in the library and i was looking through some books and i came across a book called one day at a time and i saw him there with photographs in front of his residence the dakota and i was full of anger and resentment you know i took it upon myself to judge him falsely for for you know being something other than you know in a lotus position with a flower and i got angry in my stupidity so it started with anger but i wasnt angry the night i shot him
3712477 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3712478 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3712479 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3712480 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3712481 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3712482 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3712483 there has been changing economic conditions over the last six months but we will continue to invest we dont disagree the work in elementary schools is as fundamental as in secondary schools
3712484 we have a huge responsibility for the children to work out our differences
3712485 we have thousands of on going renovations smaller class sizes and more support staff and children are receiving higher test scores and more are graduating from secondary school
3712486 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3712487 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team

3712489 the catalytic cracking unit is our main gas producing engine at the refinery
3712490 its your finishing unit its like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer youre just not able to finish off the product and get it to market
3712491 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3712492 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3712493 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3712494 nobody is going to say you are not supposed to appear but i would say i wasnt necessarily encouraged
3712495 it appears to be consistent with the previous indication that proposed witnesses had given us
3712496 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses this is a committee of parliament
3712497 the chair of a standing committee does not have the authority to take any further steps with regard to this matter
3712498 that the party wasnt really thrilled for you to go
3712499 i am telling you very clearly the national party did not tell any of the witnesses to ignore their summons
3712500 i resent profoundly that the conservative advised lowry whether or not he should attend attending a parliamentary committee is not optional and i resent profoundly them offering him talking points trying to guide what he should and should not say
3712501 i still think it is a valid thing to do
3712502 we are seeing qila become more comfortable around the calf and spending short periods of time with the calfs grandmother
3712503 it will be interesting to see if there is spontaneous lactation
3712504 there has been lots of contact calling from the calf
3712505 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3712506 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3712507 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3712508 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3712509 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician
3712510 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3712511 theyre not making any major commitments to the market canada is facing economic headwinds
3712512 when the dollar quits going up gold quits going down its going to take time to repair this dont look for a quick turnaround
3712513 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3712514 when my goggles did fill up i knew there was nothing i could do all i could do was swim
3712515 i couldnt take them off i had two caps on so i couldnt rip them off i couldnt fix them i couldnt empty them out i just had to swim
3712516 i managed to get my hand on the wall and it wasnt perfect i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3712517 but he is maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
3712518 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3712519 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3712520 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3712521 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3712522 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3712523 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need
3712524 theyre obviously one of the best teams in the world but i dont think theyre playing as well right now as they have in the past
3712525 we like to think weve got them at a pretty good time obviously it would be ideal to knock them out of the olympics and not allow them a chance to win a medal
3712526 being in the olympics for the first time is really hard
3712527 i told my players about going to atlanta where he coached norway in the 1996 games but it doesnt really matter you have to be here and experience all the distractions around you
3712528 im very pleased with our performance over the first three games theyve probably never played better soccer in their lives to make the quarterfinals is a huge accomplishment
3712529 obviously weve become rivals because weve played them so many times
3712530 we havent beaten or tied them since ive been on the team beginning in 2003
3712531 im a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
3712532 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3712533 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3712534 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3712535 seeing the reaction of people today it would seem my comments were reflecting on the larger group or women in general and that was not the intention of my comment so i thought the only way to put it to bed was to issue an apology and retraction
3712536 when you live in a fish bowl you gotta watch how you swim
3712537 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3712538 its upsetting and ridiculous to hear this from an elected official
3712539 it should never have happened in the first place there has to be a direct apology to marjory lebreton and i just think its an assault on those who are running and those who would think about running
3712540 why didnt rona ambrose speak out when peter mackay called belinda stronach a dog
3712541 i think its kind of short sighted on her part or anyone elses to insist that thibault be reprimanded
3712542 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3712543 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3712544 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3712545 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3712546 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3712547 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3712548 i sat in their room the other night and just watched them
3712549 their cribs are close together and they held each others hands as they fell asleep
3712550 it was so neat to see them comfort one another
3712551 we want to have a nice quiet low key day
3712552 maybe go for a walk in the country visit some friends
3712553 we wanted to make sure everyone that we were close to all the people whove supported us could be there
3712554 so we could say we did it we made it to a year and all of you helped us out
3712555 they couldnt figure out how to blow out the candles so their cousins helped them
3712556 by the time they were done there was more cake in their hair and on their faces than in their mouths
3712557 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences
3712558 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3712559 i watched myself on good morning america today and watched myself on the podium
3712560 i looked kind of strange ive had about 80 text messages on my phone from friends back home one of them said dude i am getting sick of seeing your ugly face on television that made me laugh
3712561 for too long canada was here to be a friendly nation and glad hander

3712565 this helicopter has a longer range capability than the interim
3712566 it will give customs the ability to fly longer surveillance missions and reach more remote locations if needed
3712567 the helicopter is the latest addition to the customs coastwatch fleet which helps to protect our northern borders from threats such as illegal foreign fishing people drug and weapon smugglers and quarantine and environmental risks

3712569 i have made a decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the goals of the operation have been achieved
3712570 the safety of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been established the aggressor has been punished and has suffered significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3712571 it is perfectly normal that russia wants to defend its own interests and the interests of russians inside russia as well as russian speakers outside russia
3712572 it is equally important that we i mean the international community want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3712573 one not to resort to the use of force two to end all military action completely
3712574 three to provide access to humanitarian aid four georgian troops return to their permanent locations five russian troops move to the line prior to the beginning of hostilities russian peacekeepers exercise additional security measures until international mechanism are created and six the beginning of an international discussion about the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia and ways of ensuring their lasting security
3712575 this doesnt mean that a sovereign state is allowed to do whatever it pleases even sovereign states have to answer for their actions
3712576 and while sovereignty is based on the will of the people and the constitution territorial integrity as a rule represents the real state of affairs
3712577 can the ossetians and the abkhaz and do they want to be a part of georgia
3712578 this question should be put to them and they will give their own unambiguous answer it is not russia or any other country that should answer this question
3712579 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3712580 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3712581 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3712582 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3712583 i would like to thank representatives of all ethnicities georgia belongs to all of you
3712584 georgia belongs to ossetians abkhaz georgians georgia belongs to georgias regions to georgian armenians georgian azeris georgian russians georgian ukrainians we have nothing against anyone we are absolutely not against the russian nation for i know very well that russia is not just ex president and current prime minister vladimir putin today russian politics is entirely dominated by putin however in the future we will definitely go back to each other
3712585 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no

3712590 saya nggak boleh egois saya punya penggemar toh video klip saya beredar di mana mana dengan baju terbuka juga
3712591 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3712592 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3712593 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3712594 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3712595 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3712596 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3712597 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game
3712598 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
3712599 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
3712600 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
3712601 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
3712602 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
3712603 this is just one of the examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
3712604 this is the birds last refueling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america
3712605 the protection of precious habitat across the entire province is our natural legacy to the future generations
3712606 we have now been able to protect the beach so we dont see that happen
3712607 the speed and severity of the dollars run higher has resulted in some long liquidation
3712608 at the moment it is hard to see an end to it but we still have some supportive factors such as inflation geopolitical tensions and falling mine supply
3712609 it looks like sentiment towards gold has turned negative were seeing long liquidation on the back of both dollar movement and the oil price movement
3712610 chef this poached chicken has been at a rolling boil for about a half hour do you want me to turn it down
3712611 chef is this the butter knife we usually use to ice the cupcakes
3712612 chef do you want these onions finely diced or just the way you did them
3712613 chef are you done putting together the grilled cheese sandwiches should i put the cheese away
3712614 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3712615 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3712616 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3712617 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3712618 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3712619 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3712620 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the us deal on its own with some of the issues
3712621 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3712622 she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
3712623 we said be smart about this dont go in and dont fall for the russian provocation do not do this
3712624 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country

3712629 in the student world of that era groups reflecting mainstream america held the allegiance of few as a result we ypsls although earnestly regarding ourselves not only as socialists but even as marxists of a sort and thus to the left of 99 percent of americans spent the largest portion of our energies battling student groups even farther to our left sometimes this allowed us to capture the ostensible middle ground
3712630 in the early 1960s we were on the losing side in what proved a harbinger of the increasing radicalization of student activism throughout the decade the left wing soon took command of ypsl and the organization flew apart in an explosion of new factions each more radical than the last by 1965 most had found their way to more fertile fields in the emergent new left ironically they also thereby cleared a path for our rump of right wingers to re create the ypsl according to our own lights
3712631 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here

3712651 his unique experience and expertise will be a tremendous asset as we pursue our goal of bringing cell based therapies into clinical practice for the treatment of a whole range of serious conditions affecting the central nervous system the liver and the pancreas

3712654 bike film festival video including amazing artistic cycling demo by ines
3712655 the board and its constituent agencies are absolutely committed to learning from this tragic case and if one clear message emerges it must be always put the child first
3712656 intelligence was received by northamptonshire police that one of the two adults was accessing the internet and abusive images of children
3712657 a computer was seized and analysed and no abusive images were found
3712658 there was nothing to substantiate it they moved on to the next investigation
3712659 it should not just have been a criminal investigation but a child protection investigation should have been launched
3712660 in this case for example an officer had some years ago logged concerns about the state of the property in which oxtoby and scott lived but as this was not a criminal matter no further action was taken to alert other agencies that they that they should perhaps look more closely at the circumstances
3712661 safeguarding of children was not paramount and thats the lesson we have to learn from this
3712662 it is vital that all agencies and organisations involved use these findings to make very real changes to our ways of working and improve the performance of our staff to minimise the risk of this happening again
3712663 we need all of you guys to be future role models
3712664 we have all lost too many people too many people are dying for foolishness
3712665 why should someone walk around carrying a gun or knife we have to remember that guns and knifes dont kill people but people kill people
3712666 we have to stop to remember that lives are far more important than material things and that human beings are much more important than money
3712667 for many of londons youths their families and indeed entire communities gang culture and gun and knife crime is all too real
3712668 but we want people to know that the situation is not yet hopeless put it down was a great opportunity for all of the housing partners to work together with youths to tackle the serious issues at hand
3712669 we encourage both young people and their parents to take a stand against gang culture we are sure that our united message reached many of the young people who attended the event
3712670 thanks to the efforts of all the partnership young people know that they do have a choice and hopefully they will now feel empowered to make the right decisions about their future
3712671 for all the talk about the private sector taking off in iraq it didn t materialize
3712672 people say well these people are poor we need to help them this is true but we didn t create any new jobs i think this will become a huge problem
3712673 i think that the government itself has been concerned about keeping a cap on the number of people that can join the public sector
3712674 when people see a sudden pay raise they will spend
3712675 to be frank we have not been fair to the poorer people or people without jobs or people not on the payroll of the government
3712676 for a short time the raises were a windfall for a handful of privately owned businesses such as the gold shops and car dealerships that cater to the doctors lawyers engineers and teachers of the public sector
3712677 said muhammad aziz 36 sitting behind the counter of his bustling gold shop in the kadhimiya neighborhood
3712678 when our salary was increased it came along with rising prices in the market
3712679 i tried to return this car to the original owner but he refused
3712680 i now think i will go to work as a taxi driver
3712681 if you go to the ministry of trade for example you can hardly find any sunnis
3712682 after the fall of the regime all the factories closed
3712683 if we went to the directorate to apply for loans they would only give them to friends relatives or people who are bribing them
3712684 even if i got the loan what would i do with it
3712685 i guess i would probably just eat it pay for my food

3712690 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3712691 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3712692 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3712693 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3712694 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3712695 mondays race really put me back a long way since then ive been basically losing weight and its continuing to go through both ends
3712696 i was very very happy with the way i raced i just didnt have enough to keep it going
3712697 this time ive got two days off between races and im pretty confident i can get back to 100 by saturday
3712698 ive been trying to force myself to eat and drink but it just keeps coming out faster than its going in

3712705 i remember my first rugby test i ever saw was in 1956 at lancaster park when the springboks played the all blacks
3712706 in 1949 it was a clean sweep in south africa 4 nil to the springboks and the country was in mourning they had to resurrect the game in new zealand and they managed to win the next series 3 1 that was in 1956 and everyone was happy again
3712707 its the number one rugby match up in the world we can say that because there are south africans and kiwis sitting here
3712708 if there were english and french they would say we are arrogant but thats our background and thats how weve been brought up in new zealand and i imagine its the same in south africa
3712709 in new zealand they call that rotation i call it commonsense

3712716 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3712717 i think he did everything that he could do and he swam with all his heart that always arouses all the emotion in you
3712718 you work hard with them fellow coach thomas ansorg and moss and myself have been on that course for several years towards this
3712719 but this is not the end for him hes got the 100m fly then were going to focus on world champs in rome next year and commonwealth games
3712720 hes got more in there and hes determined hes going to be up there on the dais
3712721 he was probably 0 5sec slightly too fast out in the 100m but the excitement of the moment just going for it he did everything that was asked of him
3712722 im really really proud of him really happy we thought he had a 1 53 in him we thought that would podium and as it turned out it wouldnt have podiumed anyway
3712723 as it turns out hes not a 1 52 swimmer yet so good luck to them they did a great job and he did a great job new new zealand record new commonwealth record
3712724 he backed himself what more can you do back yourself and go for it

3712737 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3712738 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3712739 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3712740 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3712741 now you know the show just tells them what to say or how to act theres no way everyone is this respectful and nice

3713000 hey we got a gig were doing a recording and video for lab pipettes
3713001 the ticket window will read sold out the ticket window will read sold out i know im over valuing this movie to the point of no return but the frothing masses of college amp high school students on summer vacation wont pass up this opportunity to see a cult classic in the movie theater
3713002 i have the truth i have the duty of converting these savages
3713003 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3713004 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3713005 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3713006 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3713007 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3713008 essa conta deve ser paga tamb m pelo resto do mundo via eleva o de pre os
3713009 os investimentos para esta safra foram muito elevados os custos dobraram
3713010 vamos ter de diminuir os investimentos com adubos herbicidas diesel etc tentando interferir o m nimo poss vel na produtividade
3713011 muita gente se vender tudo n o paga as d vidas

3713015 espero nadar melhor na semifinal meu principal objetivo chegar final e depois dar tudo de mim para conquistar um bom resultado
3713016 queria muito ter me classificado para a semifinal me prepararei para isso mas por outro lado estou contente a quinta vez que quebro o recorde sul americano este ano o que mostra que estou no caminho certo
3713017 of course i know hes flying cross country to the west coast i would say try him again during the middle of the afternoon
3713018 by highlighting the countrys politics instead of discussing the christian issues for which it has been licensed
3713019 if the herald repeats its alleged offenses one ministry official told the ap that the paper must satisfactorily explain why it ran the articles and must adhere to the rules or the ministry will suspend its publication
3713020 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3713021 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
3713022 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
3713023 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right
3713024 focused on ensuring that voters have the best information possible to make an informed decision on election day
3713025 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3713026 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise

3713028 obese adults and those with adult onset type 2 diabetes mellitus may already have lower levels of cognitive function in childhood consistent with a subtle developmental impairment
3713029 this study cannot identify the specific biological processes linking poorer physical control and co ordination in childhood with later obesity however it suggests that some of the processes associated with poorer neurological function in obese adults have their origins in childhood
3713030 vi har al mulig grund til at v re tilfredse med udviklingen i sirius it som nu har v ret p markedet i lidt mere end halvandet r med dygtige medarbejdere en god kundekreds og en meget fokuseret strategi er det lykkes os at f en forrygende start
3713031 i wish i had asked for my day in court rather than accepted a police caution that way i could have explained that i was trying to do what was right for my daughter
3713032 jess isnt bad but some of the 13 year olds who live here do use drugs and drink and i dont want that path for her
3713033 i did deserve the slapping because of the things id been doing
3713034 i was expecting my dad to come home from the police station and for everything to be the same as before
3713035 when an offence is admitted the offender is always liable to receive a caution
3713036 had the offence not been admitted officers would have pursued the matter with the cps
3713037 der er lige s meget fremdrift i drrb som i kr niken
3713038 vi tager selvf lgelig j vnligt kontakt til dem men her er der en problemstilling omkring sammens tning af kompetencer mellem kommunikation og it i bureauerne de ser lidt anderledes ud end de traditionelle reklamebureauer og det er et sp rgsm l om i hvilket omfang vi i foreningen har tilbud der matcher et helt web bureau med mindre bureauet har valgt at orientere sig mere helt mod kommunikation
3713039 i gamle dag var annonceoverenskomsten med til at holde sammen p bureauerne i dag er det blevet lettere at st uden for og der er et antal bureauer der har valgt at klare sig selv frem for at g ind i et f llesskab og medvirke til at l se branchens mere langsigtede problemstillinger
3713040 what were trying to do with our team is develop these mathematical models so that when theres a disease outbreak health officials have some idea how to answer what if questions
3713041 its very important for health officials because they need to figure out which groups they should target to stop the disease from spreading
3713042 once you understand how much interaction there is you can actually start predicting when you think the disease will get to other groups
3713043 we cannot just say were sitting here in canada we dont care about whats going on elsewhere outbreaks in one part of the world other parts of the world are vulnerable
3713044 it started in china and within a day or two we had cases in canada as well
3713045 if scientists work with people in china to try and understand whats going on maybe you could prevent outbreaks in other places like canada
3713046 long gone so and so never allowed that i think it was based on a statute or something
3713047 seeing the graphene sticking out without any support surprised us all
3713048 even more so that it could support a thousand times its own weight in copper nanoparticles
3713049 for example we have shone visible light through the sheets and proved that the absorption is determined by the fine structure constant the dimensionless number that is a measure of the strength of the electromagnetic interaction one of the four fundamental forces in nature experiments like this would be impossible with nanoscale suspended graphene
3713050 right now we have demonstrated that graphene is the perfect material for looking at nanoscale objects in the tem it is the ideal microscope slide because it is 100 carbon which is a light element and its perfect repeating crystal structure introduces very little unwanted background into images
3713051 graphene research is moving really fast and exciting new results and applications are reported all the time so we never know what is around the corner
3713052 we are delighted to have secured an entry into the highly attractive u s pipe and tube market
3713053 realistically this exceeded my expectations for time but i thought we would have a medal
3713054 i just have to learn to accept it its sport thats what happens sometimes ill live
3713055 the young guys are improving our times are slowly getting better at a faster rate than the world is we could have had a medal but we cant put any more pressure on us than we had
3713056 i felt great in the water and powerful coming home
3713057 itu berita enggak benar saya dan mas anang justru semakin dekat dan semakin menikmati kebersamaan kami menjelang ulang tahun perkawinan kami
3713058 saya turut prihatin dengan kesehatan besan saya makanya saya langsung ke sini dari jawa timur untuk menjenguk menemani dan memberi semangat kepada anak dan menantu saya karena ada berita yang menurut saya kurang enak didengar
3713059 mereka justru mencari pengobatan alternatif dengan metode pijat atau mengonsumsi jamu ini justru amat berbahaya bagi pasien karena penyakit tbc akan semakin parah dan kemungkinan akan menulari banyak orang
3713060 jika dilihat kecenderungan jumlah penderita tbc selalu stagnan setiap tahun bilamana ada perubahan tidaklah amat siginifikan dibanding periode waktu sebelumnya kami juga masih menyelediki penyebabnya
3713061 paling tidak kami mendapatkan rekam jejak seseorang yang masuk dalam kategori politisi busuk
3713062 kalau asal tuduh tentu saja bisa merusak citra seseorang malahan bisa bisa icw dituntut balik karena telah melakukan pencemaran nama baik individu maupun nama baik partai kami dalam hal ini membuka posko pengaduan menerima laporan masyarakat mana kader kami yang dianggap masuk dalam kategori busuk itu
3713063 santai saja surat itu bukan sesuatu yang luar biasa orang ngasih surat ya biasa saja dari segi kebijakan tidak akan membawa pengaruh banyak untuk kita orang bisa berpendapat apa saja ini kan masalah kita dan tentang kedaulatan kita sepanjang itu sesuai hukum kita kita berhak menentukan kebijakan sendiri
3713064 mereka itu kan menyampaikan lewat surat kita tidak mengerti masalahnya apa meminta penjelasan juga untuk menegaskan prinsip kedaulatan kita sudah sesuai dengan hukum kita
3713065 saya tidak mengatakan begitu intervensi as yang penting kita tahu posisi kita sudah menjalankan sesuai proses hukum orang lain boleh punya pendapat lain

3713067 los trabajadores del teatro col n estamos convocando a m sicos artistas personalidades de la cultura juntas internas organizaciones de derechos humanos sindicales estudiantiles y pol ticas y toda la poblaci n en general a la radio abierta que realizaremos este jueves a las 17 30 frente a la jefatura de gobierno
3713068 macri ha enviado a la legislatura un proyecto de ley para convertir el col n en un ente aut rquico el objetivo del gobierno es convertir al teatro en una sala de alquiler donde se realicen negocios privados en detrimento de sus trabajadores y de su producci n propia
3713069 el proyecto de autarqu a tiene 2 pilares fundamentales en primer lugar crea un directorio para el teatro elegido a dedo por el jefe de gobierno que va a tener que armar en un m ximo de 3 meses la estructura de personal del teatro el objetivo del macrismo es ir por una reducci n dr stica del personal macri ya inicio su gesti n con miles de despidos y hace menos de un mes en un seminario organizado en el centro cultural recoleta por el gobierno de la ciudad uno de los allegados al ministro del de cultura plante que el col n no deber a funcionar con m s de 100 trabajadores actualmente 1200 a esto se suma que la ley ni siquiera menciona el traslado del personal contratado al nuevo ente ante este ataque los trabajadores nos encontramos de pie para evitar el desguase del patrimonio intangible y m s importante del teatro sus trabajadores
3713070 en segundo lugar la ley habilita a hacer manejos presupuestarios por fuera de las normativas vigentes en el gobierno de la ciudad es decir legalizar el manejo discrecional de fondos para que los directivos que coloque el ejecutivo puedan hacer todo tipo de negociados con organismos privados
3713071 a la votaci n de la ley se agrega la situaci n edilicia las obras de refacci n todav a no se han reiniciado luego del fracaso del master plan el teatro se encuentra en ruinas e inundado por la negligencia y corruptela de los gobernantes de turno
3713072 una reapertura del teatro con todos sus trabajadores talleres y salas de ensayo
3713073 the fact is kids fare better with clear rules and firm consequences without structure children become self absorbed selfish and unhappy and they make everyone around them miserable too
3713074 children brought up by loving but authoritative parents those who are supportive of their children yet maintain firm limits excel academically develop better social skills feel good about themselves and are happier overall than kids whose parents are either too lenient or excessively harsh
3713075 studies show that having rules and structure makes a child feel safe and secure and teaches self control and self reliance
3713076 este convenio se basa en tres ejes principales la coproducci n la transmisi n de los oficios teatrales y la organizaci n de una temporada
3713077 es un trabajo conjunto en sociedad y hermandad cada teatro aporta lo propio o lo que mejor tiene por ejemplo si tiene un coro y no tiene orquesta se programa una pera y el col n pone la orquesta y el teatro el coro o al rev s as se va generando una nueva posibilidad de producir espect culos que estimulen la actividad cultural de la zona
3713078 gran parte de los oficios teatrales de anta o se est n perdiendo el col n es una f brica de oficios que son los que hay que trasmitir a trav s de los talleres cursos y seleccionar postulantes para realizar pasant as en el teatro
3713079 es recrear la mentalidad de organizar una temporada los teatros tienen una actividad art stica anual pero casi ninguno de los teatros tiene una temporada art stica este acuerdo posibilitar la unificaci n organizada un circuito de pera de sinf nica o de ballet el objetivo es atraer o conquistar nuevos p blicos
3713080 con este convenio ser como volver a las fuentes subray boschet
3713081 en realidad no estamos inventando nada simplemente estamos tratando de restaurar estos viejos circuitos de teatros l ricos que ten an esta din mica todo el tiempo hab a actividad eso generaba recursos ahora esta actividad se organiza con tiempo por eso es importante que cada teatro organice sus temporadas
3713082 este plan genera ayuda a distribuir mejor los recursos y a federalizar el concepto un ejemplo de la desorganizaci n actual es que el teatro provincial de salta no tiene mucha idea de lo que est organizando el teatro san mart n de tucum n o el teatro 25 de mayo de santiago del estero son instituciones regionales que hacen el mismo esfuerzo todos paralelos en lugar de combinarse a ver c mo multiplican por tres la posibilidad de brindar cultura a su gente
3713083 estos convenios no se limitan al mbito de los espect culos sino que generan diversas instancias de exigencia para los artistas y los directores lo que redunda en una mayor calidad de todos los cuerpos involucrados

3713087 i dont want this to be a war between us
3713088 we were not playing against the georgian team today if they are georgian they would certainly have been influenced by world events but certainly they are not
3713089 of course theyre not georgian they dont even know who the georgian president is
3713090 of course i know who the president is its mikheil saakashvili and i was with his wife here two days ago in the olympic village
3713091 no its too effing cold outside now take your little dog and leave me alone i want to sleep
3713092 no we wont be going strong at 50 its good to have breaks
3713093 we cant wait to chill out in our retirement homes

3713098 i believe i left it all out there heart and soul
3713099 hes the guy you want when things get intense said alternate david durante a stanford graduate
3713100 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3713101 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3713102 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3713103 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3713104 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3713105 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3713106 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the us deal on its own with some of the issues
3713107 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3713108 she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
3713109 we said be smart about this dont go in and dont fall for the russian provocation do not do this
3713110 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country
3713111 i dont feel any pressure to pick a date harbaugh said after the teams first scrimmage of camp which was closed to the media and public
3713112 in terms of running the team all the little things harbaugh said
3713113 were not talking about a huge difference weve got three guys that we believe we can win with weve just got to train them all like theyre going to be the starter
3713114 some people look at this as almost a negative thing but its really not he said
3713115 its a positive thing to where our team is absolutely confident that whoever coach says is going to start aug 28 were going to have complete confidence in
3713116 at some point youve got to start narrowing down the first guy will take more reps than the second guy and the second guy will take more reps than the third guy but we run enough plays in practice where i feel
3713117 since practice six they have really made great strides all in different ways because theyre different harbaugh said
3713118 but weve been pushing the offensive tempo this camp and i think its going to help
3713119 im almost at a loss for words phelps said of the distinction
3713120 wow the greatest olympian of all time its pretty cool saying it
3713121 dude its ridiculous how many times i have to see your ugly face
3713122 the only thing i could do is swim phelps said
3713123 i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad he conceded
3713124 you think wow i helped this guy get all these medals
3713125 this is very important for my country and for me abdel moussa said in spanish
3713126 our goal is to play in the nba he said
3713127 a lady started crying after i signed her autograph said carlos boozer of the utah jazz
3713128 i knew it was popular with europeans but this is huge
3713129 she was a wonderful lady full of energy wise opinions and extremely knowledgeable
3713130 she used to arrive early to our zcc meetings she would take my name placard and put it next to hers so we could always sit together we really hit it off from the beginning she took it upon herself to teach me the ins and outs of the zoning process and the politics involved and always gave me great advice i will really really miss her
3713131 chinas leaders know that the development of green buildings is a critical need and the olympic village can serve as a model for this development
3713132 china given its current economic growth and prosperity can be a leader in deploying and using advanced energy and environmental technology

3713182 do not be surprised at your spirits state it is only natural that after a period of fervor you experience some disturbances but do not pay attention to them obey close your eyes and hold the cross tightly the one who obeys will obtain victory spiritual life is made up of desolations and consolations and saint ignatius says that the right thing to do during desolation is to make no changes and in a time of consolation not to cling too steadfastly to it but to strengthen yourself for the next period of desolation do not fear these are clouds that must cross the sky of your soul they are hurricanes that test the roots of the trees it is summer and summers are harsh dry unpleasant and arid but happy is the one who goes through them embracing the cross and letting jesus ripen the fruit of the tree in his heart let yourself be molded let the tempest rage without disturbing you let the temptation pass and it will pass away do not doubt it leaving merits in your soul close your eyes and let the lord accomplish his will take each day as it comes and move ahead do not see enemies everywhere so that if and when they should arrive the lord will have softened them up for you do not lose time as satan wants but offer everything up for the good of the works of the cross

3713193 i said i would beat him before the race but i was just saying that i felt i had to make that statement as a competitor but i never believed it when he goes into the water he is just a man on his own separate from everyone
3713194 the truth is that is an honour to be in the same final as this man
3713195 hey ive always been good in the water its what i happen to do

3713242 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3713243 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3713244 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3713245 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3713246 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3713247 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3713248 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3713249 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3713250 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3713251 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3713252 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3713253 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3713254 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3713255 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3713256 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3713257 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3713258 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3713259 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3713260 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3713261 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3713262 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3713263 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3713264 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3713265 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3713266 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3713267 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3713268 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3713269 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3713270 the idea is to get the club up and running before the end of the year and host the wildest new years eve party ever
3713271 at least they didnt know how to speak english just chinese
3713272 and theyd show it on sportscenter highlights or something like that
3713273 hes my first true love since rod and the age difference isnt an issue
3713274 liam now has a first class ice hockey coach so hes happy
3713275 i should have known earlier more should have been done earlier
3713276 we accept full responsibility i am personally at fault for these management issues
3713277 anyone who wants to go to school goes to school but we know how to budget that
3713278 managers did not adequately challenge assumptions or demand their verification with data
3713279 statements and explanations were too often taken at face value
3713280 did not know who was in the program where they worked or how many hours they worked and what they were being paid
3713281 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3713282 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3713283 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3713284 she s great she s also 22 years old i think people forget that
3713285 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up

3713323 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3713324 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3713325 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3713326 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
3713327 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality

3713331 application of an expert interview system specifically targeted to erectile dysfunction along with a continuous platform for patient client physician communications make this particular internet system comparable to traditional medical practice
3713332 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3713333 the sample for this study was a low income population
3713334 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3713335 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3713336 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child

3713455 national survey data show that the prevalence of overweight and obese adults in the u s has increased steadily over the past three decades
3713456 if these trends continue more than 86 percent of adults will be overweight or obese by 2030 with approximately 96 percent of non hispanic black women and 91 percent of mexican american men affected this would result in 1 of every 6 health care dollars spent in total direct health care costs paying for overweight and obesity related costs
3713457 our analysis also shows that over time heavy americans become heavier
3713458 the health care costs attributable to obesity and overweight are expected to more than double every decade this would account for 15 to 17 percent of total health care costs spent

3713590 the reason the earths surface is this warm is the presence of greenhouse gases which act as a partial blanket for the longwave radiation coming from the earths surface this blanketing is known as the natural greenhouse effect
3713591 much of the thermal radiation emitted by the land and the ocean is absorbed by the atmosphere including clouds and reradiated back to earth this is called the greenhouse effect
3713592 this explanation by the ipcc is clearly misleading if not wrong the inference that the greenhouse gases are acting like a blanket suggests that they are increasing the insulating properties of the atmosphere however the main gases of the atmosphere are oxygen and nitrogen non greenhouse gases and they are also excellent insulators against the conduction of heat like a blanket adding additional trace amounts of carbon dioxide will have no appreciable impact on the insulating properties of the atmosphere

3713599 this study demonstrates that local brands win when working with ib to monetize their web sites
3713600 our partners have tremendous revenue pressure in todays market our publishing platform and advertising solutions combine to create meaningful usage and revenue
3713601 weve always advocated the local media companies not try to tackle the web on their own
3713602 and the results of this study provide solid evidence regarding why thats so a partnership with a service provider like internet broadcasting helps media companies develop their web initiatives into a new business line rather than a new marketing expense

3713604 we have been impressed with how ibs network has brought national advertisers to our local sites that we otherwise would not have landed but more importantly the advertising operations and creative services team at ib has made it relatively easy for our station sites to grow we get to focus on building compelling content and selling campaigns to local advertisers and ibs full service team takes care of the rest
3713605 in spite of the first quarter being our seasonally weakest quarter the decline in our north american operations is still disappointing while economic conditions continue to impact our results we have been diligent in our efforts to become more cost effective maintain a strong financial discipline and remain focused on implementing our strategic initiatives in the early part of the quarter we transitioned certain u s based roles to our hong kong facility and have outsourced other functions that required higher infrastructure costs this led to a reduction of approximately 10 of our u s workforce and should result in an annual full year savings of 1 000 000 despite retail pressures we have continued to maintain strong margins tracking in line with last years quarter excluding the one time charges our operating results exceeded our internal budget expectations
3713606 we also just completed our new long term strategic plan and we remain confident we are on the right path to guide us to growth in revenue and bottom line earnings

3713609 stf troops attempted to molest two women in kannakipuram and chinnappanagkaadu on 5 august the cries of the women had brought the neighbours to their rescue and the women had managed to escape sexual violence with injuries
3713610 the women had been warned that they will be killed if the matter is reported to the police and therefore they had not made any complaints
3713611 incidents of armed troops and police looking while women bathe and making untoward comments when checking the national identity cards of girl students have markedly increased

3713628 we are very excited to partner with nona this year for our third annual moonlight serenade gala their work is making such a difference in the lives of families throughout the okanagan and we want to contribute to their efforts
3713629 this event has been such a success for the past two years and we have no doubt the community will work with us again to support this cause with the same high level of enthusiasm
3713630 everything is premised around waterfront in the okanagan private moorage is a rarity moorage is at a high premium in the area and can be extremely prohibitive having a private place for your boat is a unique privilege that the sheerwater lifestyle affords
3713631 his style of dealing with employees is probably something people in my position arent crazy about
3713632 but if you look at his history he tends to grow companies he is involved with we are hopeful in that regard
3713633 is a real sign of confidence in the brand in our strategic direction

3713644 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3713645 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3713646 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3713647 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that

3713800 weve got a lot of guys who have seen a preseason poll come up while theyve been here and seen that it hasnt always been accurate so maybe that will be a good reminder for us
3713801 de repente eu senti um estrondo uma bomba mesmo senti o ch o dar uma tremida eu estava com o capacete a ainda deu aquele zunido foi muito tiro mesmo parecia filme de guerra

3713803 what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
3713804 with nature we have gone working against nature for too long
3713805 its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them gm crops out of hand
3713806 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout ing off about something which he has clearly got wrong
3713807 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3713808 we are delighted to have secured an entry into the highly attractive u s pipe and tube market
3713809 china is very very keen to join the world community the world community has more responsibility to bring china into the mainstream of world democracy
3713810 must bring it into the mainstream of society and create genuine friendship it is very essential
3713811 meantime on certain principles democracy human rights press freedom rule of law we must be firm
3713812 one big problem is fear it is a sign of weakness
3713813 but you cannot hide from the rest of the world a closed society has no future it is in chinas own interest
3713814 chinas position on tibet related issues is clear and persistent there is no change in that france can work together with china to rule out disruptions to enhance our mutual trust and to maintain the sound momentum of development of bilateral relations
3713815 if he want i am happy he dont want thats ok
3713816 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

3713819 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3713820 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3713821 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3713822 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3713823 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3713824 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3713825 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3713826 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3713827 they say barack im a republican but i support you
3713828 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3713829 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3713830 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3713831 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3713832 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3713833 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3713834 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3713835 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3713836 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3713837 i have a record of reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be joe lieberman or ted kennedy
3713838 americans are tired of partisanship they want us to work together for america in a bipartisan fashion
3713839 who have a clear record of strict adherence to the constitution of the united states and who do not believe in legislating from the bench
3713840 we will fix social security and we will do it in a bipartisan fashion
3713841 he needs social conservatives to rally to his cause they are the bulwark of the party but he has to attract the middle
3713842 i cant tell someone that just registering and voting is going to change their life
3713843 the system itself is broken due to the creation of safe districts for incumbent legislators we have the least competitive legislative races in the nation with most seats being uncontested and the sad reality is that 98 percent of the candidates who spend the most money are the ones who win
3713844 we need to build a base of support a movement for social justice that politicians will have to respect
3713845 we are registering people to vote not to support a particular candidate but to become part of the movement that will have the power to actualize our values
3713846 what always horrifies me is that no matter what side of the political spectrum youre on there is a relatively small number of people who actually elect our public servants
3713847 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3713848 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3713849 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3713850 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3713851 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3713852 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3713853 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3713854 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3713855 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3713856 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3713857 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3713858 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3713859 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3713860 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3713861 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3713862 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3713863 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3713864 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3713865 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3713866 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3713867 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3713868 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3713869 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3713870 who will be the next president of the united states
3713871 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3713872 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3713873 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3713874 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3713875 tickets for the reception where clooney will speak are going for 1 000 followed by a dinner at the home of nfc member charles adams for 10 000 a plate space for the dinner is limited to 75 guests
3713876 maybe during the convention the republicans can dedicate a large screen monitor at the xcel center to keep track of obamas second european jaunt of the campaign they could call it where in the world is barack obama the show could track him through the summer houses of the rich and famous americans who can afford to own villas overseas and put dollar signs up on a map wherever he stops off for some foie gras
3713877 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3713878 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3713879 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3713880 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3713881 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3713882 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3713883 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3713884 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
3713885 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
3713886 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
3713887 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
3713888 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3713889 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3713890 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3713891 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3713892 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3713893 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3713894 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3713895 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3713896 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3713897 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3713898 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3713899 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3713900 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3713901 i think a drop of 20 per cent is a bit over done
3713902 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3713903 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3713904 u s gasoline demand last week was almost 4 per cent lower compared to the same week in 2007 despite a considerable decline in retail prices
3713905 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3713906 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3713907 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3713908 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3713909 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3713910 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3713911 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3713912 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3713913 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3713914 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3713915 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3713916 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3713917 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3713918 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3713919 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3713920 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3713921 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3713922 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3713923 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3713924 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3713925 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3713926 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3713927 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3713928 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3713929 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3713930 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3713931 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3713932 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3713933 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3713934 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3713935 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3713936 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3713937 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3713938 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3713939 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3713940 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3713941 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3713942 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3713943 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3713944 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3713945 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3713946 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3713947 das angebot der bieterin entspricht lediglich dem gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen mindestpreis welcher nach auffassung von vorstand und aufsichtsrat nicht das langfristige wertpotenzial der gesellschaft reflektiert
3713948 central bank watch banks in wait and see mode some moves expected
3713949 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3713950 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3713951 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3713952 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3713953 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3713954 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3713955 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3713956 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3713957 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3713958 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
3713959 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
3713960 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
3713961 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
3713962 if youre doing business in the city of detroit if you own assets in the city of detroit if your corporate headquarters or other buildings that you own and operate out of are operating in the city of detroit you have a voice you have a stake in what happens in this city and you ought to be using that voice to express your concerns about your stake in this city

3713971 i said gordon brown is the right man for the job at the end of the day they believed in those times that that ship could never sink the captain still had a responsibility but the thing that actually sank it was the iceberg the challenge is how do you navigate around it
3713972 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3713973 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3713974 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3713975 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3713976 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3713977 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3713978 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3713979 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3713980 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
3713981 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3713982 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3713983 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3713984 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3713985 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3713986 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3713987 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3713988 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3713989 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3713990 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3713991 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3713992 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3713993 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3713994 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3713995 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3713996 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3713997 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3713998 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3713999 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
3714000 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
3714001 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3714002 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3714003 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3714004 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3714005 real results by the end of my first term in office
3714006 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3714007 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3714008 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3714009 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3714010 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3714011 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there

3714013 just so you all know we did set a record
3714014 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3714015 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3714016 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3714017 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3714018 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3714019 set design was one of the things that i really enjoyed along with music and architecture that were my escapes from the hard classes i took during college and law school
3714020 but ultimately i had to make a career choice and put these things aside to move forward in my profession
3714021 we began coming to the shows and quickly discovered that the entire department is a hidden gem in the universitys midst
3714022 after a few years i became acquainted with tom bloom the set designer for htf and chairman of the drama department and offered my help if they ever needed it and well its been eight years now ive been doing this
3714023 hes a veritable renaissance craftsperson who has fashioned for us some exquisite props
3714024 everybody enjoys harveys company because hes such a great people person actors and technicians often are found engaged in wide ranging conversations with him some past heritage employees are known to have phoned harvey seeking his artistic and technical advice on a particular project that they were working on
3714025 these are museum quality sculptures viewed from the third row and back but if you get too close you can see the imperfections but thats the thing theyre not for a museum
3714026 theater is great because youre always moving forward creating this illusion that lasts for a week and then throwing it in the dumpster you have to learn to consider the level of detail versus pragmatism a skill young technicians hone when working at htf
3714027 they are mostly just conversation pieces for whenever we have people over at home ive also kept them in case theyre ever needed for another show
3714028 weve built some pretty marvelous things such as an art deco style wall with billowing clouds charging horses and cornucopias for the stateroom in anything goes
3714029 i carved on that for almost three weeks and it was fun and impressive but like most things in set design it only lasted three minutes on stage
3714030 black families have been known to incorporate people and create wider associations
3714031 i wanted to take this class because i think it is important culturally to understand what socially people often tend to misunderstand
3714032 now that we have delved into some readings and i have learned more about past west african and african american families this class forces me to look at my present idea and conception of family
3714033 it is very interesting to see the different structures of black families along with seeing the different ways in which these structures are made possible
3714034 since the class is smaller the discussions are much more intimate
3714035 the only career i ever prepared for was to be a prosecutor
3714036 i came to law school knowing i wanted to be a prosecutor the entire time i was in law school i never really thought about doing anything other than being a prosecutor
3714037 susan modernized our admissions operation and brought a personal warmth and elegance to all of her many interactions with applicants
3714038 and i cant imagine a better choice than jason trujillo as senior assistant dean for admissions and financial aid jason combines admissions experience a broad appreciation for the institutions goals and culture and a tremendous skill for communicating and working with other people as a graduate of the law school he also understands the special qualities of this institution and its students
3714039 oh i dont need a brochure because ive seen that online
3714040 im going to give it a shot if for some reason it doesnt agree with me or i dont agree with them and they dont like me i can always go back to being a prosecutor back home in new jersey
3714041 do i want this person wearing the virginia brand out there in the legal profession

3714048 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3714049 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3714050 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3714051 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3714052 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3714053 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3714054 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3714055 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3714056 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3714057 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3714058 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3714059 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3714060 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3714061 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3714062 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3714063 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3714064 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3714065 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3714066 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3714067 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3714068 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3714069 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3714070 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3714071 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3714072 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

3714075 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3714076 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3714077 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3714078 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3714079 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3714080 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3714081 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3714082 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3714083 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3714084 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3714085 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3714086 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3714087 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3714088 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3714089 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3714090 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3714091 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3714092 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3714093 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3714094 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
3714095 police in kingston have issued cctv images of a man they wish to trace in connection with a
3714096 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3714097 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3714098 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3714099 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3714100 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3714101 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3714102 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3714103 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3714104 he nader is a reminder that the democratic process is alive and well and still being practiced
3714105 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3714106 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3714107 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3714108 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3714109 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3714110 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3714111 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3714112 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3714113 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3714114 mbeki is going to give a report to the southern african development commnunity chairman of defence and security angola president jose eduardo dos santos
3714115 the talks are adjourned not ended but i wouldnt say until when tsvangirai needs more time to consult on specific matter s
3714116 i wouldnt know about it we are facilitating discussions among three parties
3714117 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3714118 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3714119 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together
3714120 any so called government of national unity which did not involve tsvangirai would effectively be a farce
3714121 no deal has been signed by anyone dialogue is still continuing
3714122 the army and security forces will not be terrorised by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that
3714123 i see this within a spate of attacks against the army that could be reprisal attacks for the armys crushing of fatah al islam last year
3714124 the army has surrounded the scene and begun to investigate the incident
3714125 terrorist exploitation of the serious political controversies that have intensified in recent days
3714126 syria staunchly denounces the criminal act perpetrated this morning in tripoli that killed many innocent civilians
3714127 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3714128 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3714129 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3714130 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3714131 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3714132 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3714133 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3714134 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3714135 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3714136 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3714137 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3714138 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3714139 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3714140 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3714141 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3714142 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3714143 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3714144 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3714145 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3714146 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3714147 these are all small things and they all add up
3714148 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3714149 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3714150 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3714151 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3714152 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3714153 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3714154 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3714155 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3714156 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3714157 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3714158 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3714159 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3714160 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3714161 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3714162 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3714163 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3714164 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3714165 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3714166 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3714167 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3714168 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3714169 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3714170 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3714171 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3714172 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3714173 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3714174 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3714175 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3714176 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3714177 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3714178 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3714179 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3714180 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3714181 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3714182 we followed dean in a lot of games last season and he was very good but he had injury problems before that
3714183 i learned nothing i was not enriched in any way im weary with the worlds disappointing stimulants i want more of christ
3714184 i have begun to suspect that we cant see the entertainment idolatry in our own lives
3714185 whatever is in the clients best interest is in fast switchs long term best interest as a supplier to the client
3714186 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3714187 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3714188 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3714189 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3714190 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3714191 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3714192 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3714193 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3714194 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3714195 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3714196 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3714197 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3714198 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part

3714200 these results show that a patient may benefit the most if these two drugs are given in this particular order
3714201 the results of this study could change the way breast cancer patients are treated
3714202 the good news is the that the two treatments are relatively inexpensive and already used in the clinic
3714203 establishing the most effective combinations of drug treatments and the timings in which they are given is an important area of clinical research
3714204 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3714205 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3714206 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3714207 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3714208 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3714209 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3714210 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the us deal on its own with some of the issues
3714211 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3714212 she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
3714213 we said be smart about this dont go in and dont fall for the russian provocation do not do this
3714214 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country
3714215 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3714216 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3714217 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3714218 la parola che mi risuona nella mente finalmente questi 200 li aspettavo da quattro anni

3714220 avevo il costume di allenamento sotto quello da gara lho fatto per evitare brutte sorprese
3714221 and my choice is to keep my body and my soul and the bodies and souls of my children clean
3714222 mankind states that if we do not vaccinate our child he she may become sick and die mankind also states that an unvaccinated child may cause others to become sick and die this principle contradicts the peace and balance that i seek in my journey to god it also contradicts the love i feel for mankind as an instrument of jesus christ
3714223 a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems
3714224 the practice of the board of education has been to meet with the parents to ask them questions with regard to their religious beliefs
3714225 as a state we have to sort through all those questions and answer them

3714247 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants

3714302 para criar plasticamente a realidade pura necess rio reduzir as formas naturais aos elementos constantes da forma e a cor natural cor prim ria
3714303 uma maior consci ncia da express o das formas naturais produz meios mais puros de express o
3714304 o principal problema das artes pl sticas n o evitar a representa o dos objetos mas ser t o objetivo quanto poss vel
3714305 se a vis o objetiva fosse poss vel nos daria uma verdadeira imagem da realidade
3714306 a arte requer o despojamento da forma limitadora porque esta ltima impede a express o do ritmo liberado
3714307 somente por meio do conhecimento t cnico se pode obter uma verdadeira compreens o das artes pl sticas
3714308 o aspecto t cnico consiste no uso dos meios de express o volumes planos linhas cores e no desenvolvimento destes meios de express o at seu estado puro
3714309 para gozar da express o pl stica pura de uma obra de arte deve se ordenar os fatores psicol gicos que esta nos desperta
3714310 toda arte moderna se distingue por uma liberdade maior ainda que relativa da opress o do tema
3714311 a arte a afirma o est tica da vida completa unidade e equil brio livre de toda opress o por esta raz o pode revelar o mal da opress o e ensinar a maneira de combat la
3714312 importante compreender que as novas constru es n o devem ser criadas sob influ ncia do passado n o devem ser repeti es do que j foi expresso
3714313 a arte moderna recha a os m todos de express o usados no passado mas desenvolve seu verdadeiro conte do continua aquilo que a arte do passado come ou a transforma o da vis o natural aquilo que a arte do passado levou a cabo de uma maneira mais ou menos invis vel devido opress o da poca a arte moderna realiza de forma mais vis vel
3714314 la belleza viviente de la naturaleza no puede copiarse s lo puede expresarse
3714315 o nico problema da arte alcan ar um equil brio entre o subjetivo e objetivo
3714316 a arte tem demonstrado que a express o universal s pode ser criada por uma verdadeira equa o do universal e do individual
3714317 pode se falar com acerto de uma evolu o nas artes pl sticas este fato merece ser assinalado pois revela o verdadeiro caminho da arte o nico sendero pelo qual podemos avan ar
3714318 o tempo um processo de intensifica o por meio da intensifica o se criam sucessivamente sobre planos mais profundos a extens o permanece sempre no mesmo plano
3714319 nossa subjetividade entende mas n o cria a obra os precursores criam gra as sua rea o ao est mulo externo s o guiados n o pela massa mas pelo que eles sentem e v em descobrem consciente ou inconscientemente as leis fundamentais ocultas na realidade e aspiram a realiz las deste modo adiantam o desenvolvimento humano sabem que n o poss vel servir humanidade fazendo com que a arte seja compreens vel para todo mundo isto seria tentar o imposs vel serve se a humanidade esclarecendo seu caminho aqueles que n o v em se rebelar o tratar o de compreender e terminar o por ver em arte a busca de um conte do compreens vel para todos falsa o conte do ser sempre individual
3714320 a vida real a m tua a o de duas oposi es do mesmo valor mas de diferentes aspectos e natureza sua express o pl stica a beleza universal
3714321 a arte e a vida se esclarecem mais e mais revelam cada vez mais as leis segundo as quais se cria um equil brio real e vital
3714322 a intui o esclarece o pensamento puro unindo se assim com ele conjuntamente forma uma intelig ncia que n o simplesmente do c rebro que n o calcula mas que sente e pensa que criativa na arte e na vida desta intelig ncia deve surgir a arte n o figurativa na qual o instinto j n o tem uma parte importante aqueles que n o compreendem esta intelig ncia consideram a arte n o figurativa simplesmente um produto intelectual
3714323 a arte abstrata op e se a uma representa o natural das coisas mas n o se op e natureza op e se animalidade primitiva do homem mas identifica se com as leis da cultura das rela es puras
3714324 primeiro e antes de mais nada est a lei fundamental do equil brio din mico que se op e ao equil brio est tico que necessita a forma particular
3714325 para que uma express o art stica pura desperte emo o h que se abster da figura o e ser neutra
3714326 cada vez torna se mais bvio n o s a inutilidade da figura o mas tamb m os obst culos que ela cria a arte n o figurativa se desenvolve nesta busca de clareza
3714327 a execu o e a t cnica jogam um papel muito importante na tentativa de estabelecer a vis o mais ou menos objetiva que exige a ess ncia da obra n o figurativa
3714328 quanto menos bvio for o trabalho do artista mais objetiva ser a obra
3714329 a execu o da obra de arte deve contribuir para a revela o dos fatores subjetivos e objetivos em um equil brio m tuo guiando se pela intui o poss vel obter este resultado a execu o sumamente importante na obra de arte atrav s dela em grande parte que a intui o se manifesta e cria a ess ncia da obra
3714330 o que distingue o artista n o figurativo do figurativo o fato de que em suas cria es se libera de sentimentos individuais e particulares que recebe do exterior e de que se dissocia do dom nio da inclina o individual
3714331 tudo indica que mondrian n o foi um artista pela gra a de deus mas que conquistou o seu g nio atrav s da inamov vel for a de vontade perseveran a e trabalho rduo e que nada nem o prazer nem as mulheres as honras ou o bem estar o afastou do seu des gnio transcender o individual para atingir o universal e aproximar se tanto quanto poss vel da perfei o descobrindo por entre a exuber ncia da vida o caminho da proje o e afirma o da ess ncia do ser e a partir de um estado de eterno movimento extrair a verdade pura e original era esta a paix o de um homem isento de paix es era este o ideal de um pintor cuja extraordin ria lucidez o iria isolar do comum dos homens

3714343 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3714345 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3714346 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3714377 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3714436 technology must be constrained and controlled and thats true of internet sounds movies that show smoking and the russian and iranian military
3714437 i used to think that personal freedom had no bounds and that no one should interfere with anyone who wanted to alter their brain smoke obtain nuclear weapons or invade countries on their border by claiming that they had citizens of their own at risk in that country you know the excuse russia is using today is the same one that hitler used when he invaded austria anyway im against all of that today we have to have the u n take over control of our lives and tell us what to do only self appointed dictators and socialists like most of the members of the u n understand whats best for us thats why obama is so big on the u n and his proposed global poverty act which will send them 845 billion more us tax dollars than we already contribute wait a minute maybe putin and ahmadinejad are already in that category i guess they probably know whats best never mind
3714438 all things for all people who want it thats what i say
3714439 you dont want to pay taxes you shouldnt have to you want to listen to mind altering sounds or smoke regardless of your age go for it i think restrictions of any kind hinder humankind and are artificial and subjective there are no real rules here except those we allow to be imposed on us its silly to think that anyone should be able to make anyone of us do what they want i smoke i like sex and drugs if russia likes to takeover other countries what do i care you know the digital drug thing is really just so cool the only cost you have is an internet connection and once you download the sounds you can use them over and over for free i can get screwed up for next to nothing this will run drug dealers out of business and we still fly high outstanding

3714441 how could you depict churchill without an actor smoking a cigar the very idea is ridiculous
3714442 well end up with the bizarre situation where perfectly acceptable films get an 18 just because an actor has a cigarette
3714443 i like freedom and the rule of law and a proper balance between both is critical to a free society and a strong economy

3714548 it feels like your leg just bends without the kneecap being in there
3714549 it really made me angry because it was the start of a new workout session

3714555 every day i can feel myself getting a little more confident ive just got to keep at it
3714556 i think he will be a really steady force for us
3714557 we feel like anytime we can get the ball on the 40 43 yard line we should get three points hes got the ability to do that
3714558 i was all right physically i just think it was one of those bad games
3714559 obviously i could have done better but sometimes things just dont go right
3714560 the fans definitely have been supportive thats helped me keep my head up and get ready for this season
3714561 youve just got to learn from games like that and become a better player
3714562 i figured i had to get back on track after that game and show coach petrino what i could do and what i had in my leg
3714563 thats what really hurt me when i got injured during the summertime because i really wanted to show how hard i could work and show these coaches what i can do
3714564 he did a real good job rehabbing the last couple of weeks and getting it in shape
3714565 hes got to prove he can take their reps away and prove he can understand what hes doing in the passing game and in protection
3714566 i really liked the way he ran in the spring game
3714567 he showed a lot of physicalness and ran downhill well
3714568 just getting back with the team and being together again and trying to make things right again
3714569 those freshmen coming in and helping out thats a load off my back
3714570 i have been happy with the way hes been catching the ball in traffic
3714571 i had a couple of catches but one of them was on a busted assignment
3714572 i hope they are because this is what we got
3714573 we could be as good as anyone in the country
3714574 its been since the spring that i took a snap so i had to get back into the groove of things
3714575 there wasnt too much rust because ive been working every day trying to get back
3714576 there will be a lot of catch up for him
3714577 hes got to prove he can take reps away and prove he can understand what hes doing in the passing game and in protection

3714581 i was thinking whoo he kind of put some air under that
3714582 all of them and they adjust well to the ball
3714583 that drill we do with linebackers and running backs its certainly an advantage to the running back
3714584 petitioner chevron is ordered to pay the amount of p893 781 768 21 plus six percent legal interest per annum accruing from the date of promulgation of this decision until its finality
3714585 there was a calculated and preconceived course of action adopted by petitioner purposely to evade the payment of the correct customs duties then prevailing
3714586 this was done in collusion with the former district collector who allowed the acceptance of the late ieirds and the collection of duties using the three percent declared rate
3714587 a clear indication of petitioners deliberate intention to defraud the government was its non disclosure of discrepancies on the duties in the import entry declaration ieds which is 10 percent and ieirds which is three percent covering the shipments
3714588 it was not by sheer coincidence that by the time petitioner filed its ieirds way beyond the mandated period the rate of duty had already been reduced
3714589 i was absolutely thrilled to get the phone call from the iaaf although it now means a different challenge to get a baby sitter while all three races are on

3714613 we of course conduct an annual analysis of bank charges and fees and the way that they operate
3714614 but whether we ought to be considering a sort of a major investigation id have to say that i think the issue of bank fees and charges has been subject to some very heavy scrutiny over a period of some time so i doubt that its the sort of thing that would merit a major investigation

3714707 sowohl die geplante neue linienf hrung des bisherigen 65ers k nftig linie 1 als auch der linie j k nftig linie 2 und des 71ers in hinkunft linie 4 via ringstra e wird von nahezu allen verkehrsexperten begr t die neuen verbindungen schaffen bessere anbindungen an die u bahn reduzieren das umsteigen bei der fahrt zwischen gro en bezirken die derzeit noch verkehrenden ring rund linien werden hingegen im gesamten streckenverlauf mit ausnahme von touristen nur sehr wenig in anspruch genommen
3714708 die einrichtung der neuen durchgangslinien vom fahrgastbeirat der wiener linien initiiert worden ist und dem vorschlag selbstverst ndlich fahrgaststromuntersuchungen zugrunde liegen so prognostizierte das sterreichische institut f r raumplanung ir in seiner untersuchung dass den neuen linien ein hoher fahrgastzuwachs mit plus 700 000 fahrg sten j hrlich beschieden sein wird
3714709 die wiener linien stellen also konkrete untersuchungen an bevor nderungen in ihrem liniennetz erfolgen die wiener vp versucht hingegen mit imagin ren und deshalb nicht nachvollziehbaren anruf quasi umfragen verkehrspolitik zu machen so unseri s sieht diese dann auch aus dass viele wochen nach der pr sentation der neuen tram durchgangslinien die wiener vp sich erst jetzt mit diesem thema eingehender besch ftigt unterstreicht einmal mehr die inkompetenz dieser partei auch und vor allem in verkehrsangelegenheiten
3714710 von der sp wurde die touristenbim mit der begr ndung abgelehnt die linien 1 und 2 dienen als touristen bim f r besucherinnen das ist jetzt nicht mehr der fall

3714736 we should go to prayer with deep humility and an awareness of our nothingness we must invoke the help of the holy spirit and that of our good angel and then remain still in gods presence full of faith that he is more in us than we are in ourselves

3714916 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3714917 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations

3714928 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3714935 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3714936 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3714939 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3714940 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3714941 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3715127 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3715128 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3715129 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3715130 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3715131 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3715132 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3715133 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3715134 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3715135 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3715136 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3715137 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3715138 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3715139 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3715140 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3715141 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3715142 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3715143 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3715144 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3715145 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3715146 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3715147 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3715148 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3715155 os jogadores t m que abrir m o de tudo da parte individual dos problemas particulares porque o santos n o pode esperar

3715158 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3715159 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3715160 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3715161 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3715162 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3715163 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3715164 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3715165 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3715166 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3715167 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3715168 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3715169 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3715170 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3715171 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3715172 who are open to doing something on the production side
3715173 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3715174 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3715175 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3715176 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3715177 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3715178 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3715179 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3715180 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3715181 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3715182 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3715183 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3715184 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3715185 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3715186 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

3715195 may your mother be bereaved your wife be widowed your children be orphaned and may you be struck down in the next war and any memory of you be erased
3715196 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3715197 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3715198 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3715199 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3715200 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3715201 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3715202 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3715203 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3715204 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3715205 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3715206 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3715207 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3715208 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3715209 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3715210 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3715211 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3715212 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3715213 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3715214 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3715215 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3715216 it would not be right to talk about these things
3715217 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
3715218 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
3715219 i do go out with my friends and see my family for dinner or to the cinema or to catch up over coffees its kind of normal and the only social side i dont have is going out clubbing i dont do that in the summer months and only occasionally in the winter it doesnt bother me that much
3715220 boulder liberal mark udall has made a remarkable transformation from domestic drilling opponent to suddenly deciding it should be a part of our energy policy
3715221 it is quite amazing how public pressure for more domestic drilling has forced boulder liberal udall to make such a remarkable u turn on domestic drilling
3715222 boulder liberal udall has voted against offshore drilling fifteen times voted against drilling in alaska four times voted against exploration on colorados roan plateau blocked legislation for oil shale development voted against expanding refinery capacity six times and voted against clean coal technology six times

3715234 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3715235 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3715236 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3715237 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3715238 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3715239 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3715240 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3715241 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3715242 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3715243 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3715244 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3715245 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3715246 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3715247 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3715259 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3715260 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3715261 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride

3715266 we need to accept above all that we cannot guarantee to regenerate every town and every city in britain that has fallen behind just as we cant buck the market so we cant buck economic geography either places that enjoyed the conditions for creating wealth in the coal powered 19th century often do not do so today port cities had an advantage in an era when exporting manufactured goods by sea was a vital source of prosperity today the sea is a barrier to their potential for expansion and they are cut off from the main road transport routes more generally the economic pull of europe has boosted the south east at the expense of the north wales and scotland luck has also played its part in 1900 london had finance and manchester had cotton finance has since prospered and cotton collapsed reinforcing geographical changes there is no realistic prospect that our regeneration towns and cities can converge with london and the south east there is however a very real prospect of encouraging significant numbers of people to move from those towns to london and the south east we know that the capital and its region are economic powerhouses that can grow and create new high skilled high wage service sector hubs at the same time market mechanisms can be used to induce some firms to move out of the south east
3715267 we know that the south east offers the greatest agglomeration potential so it makes sense to think seriously about having more than one large city in the south east where london has dominated for so long we also know that cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london and both are well located economically we should consider expanding both dramatically just as liverpool and manchester expanded in the 19th century dynamic economies require dynamic economic geography of course there are successful high tech clusters outside the south east and it is right that they should build on their strengths but in many cases that does not imply huge expansion manchester leeds and newcastle for example all have decided strengths but they are not successful enough to deliver prosperity to neighbouring towns such as rochdale bradford and sunderland in the way that london is able to support relatively poor communities in north kent and south essex

3715291 its fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and i think its going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought
3715292 with rpi inflation reaching 5 in july an acceleration in pay growth cannot be ruled out and even if it stays subdued the mpc has plenty of other inflation concerns which are likely to keep rates on hold for another couple of months at least
3715293 the first funkyou site was a project started by okapi studio around 2004 and like many of those reading this right now we were watching and posting on that site everybody thought it was a cool project but then towards the end of 2005 it all stopped and sometime after that the domain registration for funkyou ro expired

3715320 steps were taking will help address the problem of availability but its not going to solve it americans should be prudent in their use of energy during the course of the next few weeks dont buy gas if you dont need it
3715321 dubya is a humorless stump of a being and has been a career incompetent at anything he has ever touched and will go down in history as having committed more crimes and treasonous behavior in and around the white house than richard nixon would have been convicted had he not resigned first
3715322 just before the take he comes back to where we were all waiting and he says okay guys this is what im gonna do im gonna go bop bop bop whooooap and then well all start dancing and i was like okay and then he was gone and then it was rolling and then it was action and then we were like in the scene and he did this thing and we all like did it with him and it was just it was amazing
3715323 one night he and george plimpton and i went to madison square garden to see the fights
3715324 some people got poetry in their blood and some dont his is so difficult to track its hard to figure out whether its angelic or satanic but it is certainly poetic
3715325 hey fellas i put my pants on one leg at a time like everybody but once my pants are on i make gold records
3715326 i remember that i was talking to my attorney and i said how great it would be if he had a tail because i have animals and a tail is so expressive on a cat you can tell everything you can tell if theyre annoyed you can tell whether theyre scared
3715327 dark skinned foreigners from the middle east to fight our war for us
3715328 we want this city to re emerge as i said i cant imagine america without a vibrant new orleans its just a matter of timing were cautious about encouraging people to return at this moment of history
3715329 listen i i i wanna to thank uhh leaders of the in the faith and uhh faith based and community based community for being here weve got people who represent thousands of volunteers who are in the midst of helping save lives
3715330 heres what i believe i believe that the great city of new orleans will rise again and be a greater city of new orleans i believe the town where i used to come from houston texas to enjoy myself occasionally too much will be that very same town that it will be a better place to come to
3715331 well i could be wrong but i believe uh diversity is an old wooden ship that was used during the civil war era
3715332 but dubya is a very different person than the way they make him out to be on television and everything youve been saying about him is all wrong
3715333 when its all said and done he will be bigger than fdr and will stand in history larger than abraham lincoln on his best day
3715334 i knew that your nazi genes would infect you someday are you on the payroll now christ you sound like armstrong williams
3715335 im just trying to clue you in before the march of history spells doom on your work and its really good work by the way
3715336 they had me up at the big house last night all alone with the man we drank wild turkey in front of the fireplace and ate some of the tastiest chicken fingers i ever had and listened to the his coldplay collection and dubya got a little emotional about things in new orleans then he went on and told me he was the last great social engineer left in the american political landscape in the time honored tradition of b f skinner and lbjs great society
3715337 and dont ever try drinking with me again the concept of drinking with somebody who once drank with dubya is too much to handle dont you know its the two minute warning
3715338 he must have 5 000 illegally downloaded songs on that thing but dubya swears its his personal stash and he never makes cd copies the man really appreciates music especially classic rock and roll and heavy metal he even has metallica and u2 bootlegs on his backup harddrive which he got from the bands themselves
3715339 im leaving for mazatlan tomorrow uh for an extended vacation i dont know where you got my number but lose it for the hundredth time stay away from me
3715340 you know with these connections i could get you on air force one for the next trip to new orleans it would be me you dubya and the neville brothers we could survey the damage and discuss the events of the day with the president eat some gumbo get a leg up with the locals we would be on the a list partner
3715341 he likes you because you butcher scripture just like he does dubya loves a little scripture he can recite the book of revelations from top to bottom with no breaks
3715342 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen
3715343 hector paused for a long moment then he continued with a solitary yet ceremonial tone which disturbed me even further
3715344 and has become the haunt of devils and a lodging for every foul spirit and dirty loathsome fowl
3715345 rode the armies of heaven on white horses from his mouth came a sharp sword to strike the pagans with he is the one who will rule them with an iron sceptre and tread out the wine of almighty gods fierce anger
3715346 the idea of dubya cruising around in a federal disaster zone in the perfect italian sportscar and paraphrasing the book of revelations is too bizarre even for me
3715347 katrina exposed serious problems in our response capability at all levels of government and to the extent that the federal government didnt fully do its job right i take responsibility i want to know what went right and what went wrong i want to know how to better cooperate with state and local government
3715348 and like that he was gone underground nobody has ever seen him since he becomes a myth a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night rat on your pop and keyser soze will get you and no one ever really believes
3715349 keaton always said i dont believe in god but im afraid of him well i believe in god and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze
3715350 fighting them over there so we dont have to fight them here
3715351 who is keyser soze he is supposed to be turkish some say his father was german nobody believed he was real nobody ever saw him or knew anybody that ever worked directly for him but to hear kobayashi tell it anybody could have worked for soze you never knew that was his power the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt exist
3715352 the good news is and its hard for some to see it now that out of this chaos is going to come a fantastic gulf coast like it was before out of the rubbles of trent lotts house hes lost his entire house theres going to be a fantastic house and im looking forward to sitting on the porch
3715353 steps were taking will help address the problem of availability but its not going to solve it americans should be prudent in their use of energy during the course of the next few weeks
3715354 todays enemies do not mass armies on borders or navies on high seas they blend in with the civilian population they emerge to strike and then they retreat back into the shadows and thats why there are thousands of our fellow citizens running down every single piece of intelligence we can find doing everything we can to disrupt folks that might be here in america trying to hurt you
3715355 right in the way of some serious hurricanes and i dont think id be waving those gay pride flags in gods face

3715358 no sin will go unpunished by the lord except if you turn your back on jesus and dont accept him as your personal savior may the lord have mercy on your soul
3715359 even though im a tranquil guy now at this stage of my life i have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray the trust by exposing the name of our sources they are in my view the most insidious of traitors
3715360 i want to thank the president and the ceo of constellation energy mayo shattuck thats a pretty cool first name isnt it mayo pass the mayo his wife molly appreciated that
3715361 thinks about iraq every day because he understands we have troops in harms way
3715362 take a message we might get back to them and him later on the fuzzy details
3715363 my way of joking is to tell the truth thats the funniest joke in the world
3715364 well it really seemed like attacking was the right thing to do but if we gotta bury a few more heathens out in the sand dunes so be it
3715365 then you better start swimming or youll sink like a stone for the times they are a changing

3715372 the fix is already in and we better watch our flank in ohio
3715373 if you want a vision of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever
3715374 the american system is the most ingenious system of control in world history with a country so rich in natural resources talent and labour power the system can afford to distribute just enough wealth to just enough people to limit discontent to a troublesome minority it is a country so powerful so big so pleasing to so many of its citizens that it can afford to give freedom of dissent to the small number who are not pleased there is no system of control with more openings apertures flexibilities rewards for the chosen there is none that disperses its control more complexly through the voting system the work situation the church the family the school the mass media none more successful in mollifying opposition with reforms isolating people from one another creating patriotic loyalty
3715375 my names clayton b normal ive been sent here from the white house and wed sure like you to come out hard on the flank on this social security bill were working on you can call me clay

3715395 dont be so dramatic tommie boy this is called alliance building and shaping the public policy debate
3715396 in this climate i cant guarantee anything not without some budget giveaways and besides clayton they all want something in return
3715397 spare me the grubby details i think in big concepts and my mind is only good for speeches columns and white papers but you should get yourself immersed in a way that instills accountability and measurability in your communications plans just have seven votes off this roster of names by the end of business friday if they come through when the time comes well be sure to burn those credit card receipts along with these e mails
3715398 nope tommie boy im leaving and i think you need to dedicate a little more time to consider the possibilities just make sure that your life doesnt take a turn for the worse
3715399 any good time had while wearing pajamas positive uplifting experience can be a party of one or several not to be confused with a pajama party although it would fit in some circumstances
3715400 a brilliantly crafted tale of political intrigue and cultural upheaval
3715401 and so the tiring beat continues like were distant vessels breaking against a raging sea
3715402 compensates for the tremendous sacrifices they are called upon to make
3715403 for the first time in my own life i find myself unable to go to mass during the most heated bouts of rhetoric coming from the vatican this summer i felt tears of grief and anger welling up where once i had been able to contain them faith beyond resentment began to seem unreachable perhaps a new pope will change things but the odds are that hostility will get even worse i revere those who can keep up the struggle within the channels of the church i respect those who have left but i am somewhere in between now there are moments in a spiritual life when the heart simply breaks some time in the last year mine did i can only pray that in some distant future some other gay people not yet born will be able to come back to the church to sing in the choir and know that the only true scandal in the world is the scandal of gods love for his creation all of it all of us in a church that may one day finally become home to us all
3715404 life is a job you get 14 50 a day but after you die you have to pay for your sins stealing a hub cap is around 100 dollars masturbation is 35 cents it doesnt seem like much but it adds up if theres money left when you subtract what you owe from what youve earned you can go to heaven if not you have to go back to work sort of like reincarnation many nuns are mafia guys working it off
3715405 commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction
3715406 we conclude that the intelligence community was dead wrong in almost all of its pre war judgments about iraqs weapons of mass destruction this was a major intelligence failure its principal causes were the intelligence communitys inability to collect good information about iraqs wmd programs serious errors in analyzing what information it could gather and a failure to make clear just how much of its analysis was based on assumptions rather than good evidence on a matter of this importance we simply cannot afford failures of this magnitude
3715407 what bothers me is when politics and ideology get in the way of logic and consistency
3715408 come on down and tell us how you want it sized scoped and press released partner
3715409 we have a court that has essentially stuck its finger in gods eye and said were going to legislate you out of the schools were going to take your commandments from off the courthouse steps in various states were not going to let little children read the commandments of god were not going to let the bible be read no prayer in our schools we have insulted god at the highest levels of our government and then we say why does this happen well why its happening is that god almighty is lifting his protection from us
3715410 if jesus had been killed twenty years ago catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses
3715411 catholics have no right to impose their views on others even if they say homosexual conduct is unfitting for a catholic they have no right to impose that on the nation
3715412 the dissident does not operate in the realm of genuine power at all he is not seeking power he has no desire for office and does not gather votes he does not attempt to charm the public he offers nothing and promises nothing he can offer if anything only his own skin and he offers it solely because he has no other way of affirming the truth he stands for his actions simply articulate his dignity as a citizen regardless of the cost
3715413 i would warn orlando that youre right in the way of some serious hurricanes and i dont think id be waving those gay pride flags in gods face if i were you
3715414 and when the people say weve had enough we are going to take over
3715415 they can succeed during this decade in winning back control of the institutions that have been taken from them over the past 70 years expect confrontations that will be not only unpleasant but at times physically bloody this decade will not be for the faint of heart but the resolute institutions will be plunged into wrenching change we will be living through one of the most tumultuous periods of human history
3715416 when it is over i am convinced gods people will emerge victorious
3715417 i like the idea of people running for office theres a positive effect when you run for office maybe some will run for office and say vote for me i look forward to blowing up america i dont know i dont know if that will be their platform or not but its i dont think so i think people who generally run for office say vote for me im looking forward to fixing your potholes or making sure you got bread on the table
3715418 the only way to look at a politician is down
3715419 the only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction
3715420 were working out the details on this paul scooter will give you the run down later tonight at home from a pay phone
3715421 my fellow americans im pleased to announce that ive signed legislation outlawing the soviet union we begin bombing in five minutes
3715422 i am not worried about the deficit it is big enough to take care of itself
3715423 the united states and the u s stand together in support of the iraqi people and the new iraqi government which will soon come into action
3715424 sometimes words have consequences you dont intend them to mean bring em on is the classic example when i was really trying to rally the troops and make it clear to them that i fully understood you know what a great job they were doing and those words had an unintended consequence it kind of some interpreted it to be defiance in the face of danger that certainly wasnt the case

3715431 its an important concept for our fellow citizens to understand that no one in need will ever be forced to choose a faith based provider thats an important concept for people to understand what that means is if youre the methodist church and you sponsor an alcohol treatment center they cant say only methodists only methodists who drink too much can come to our program all drunks are welcome is what the sign ought to say

3715441 experienced politicians have learned to avoid body language associated with deceit
3715442 they dont for example look away when fibbing instead they stare brazenly into the camera
3715443 just like a poker player every politician has a tell a tiny signal he unwittingly gives out whenever hes being deceptive
3715444 once a politician has been caught in a single lie all you have to do is scrutinize a videotape of the speech and find his tell so you cant be hoodwinked again
3715445 you see the president doing it in his state of the union address of january 2003 when he warned that iraq had wmds citing as proof that the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
3715446 of course the white house already knew that evidence had been forged
3715447 rummy can be seen doing this last spring when he vowed publicly that all iraqis detained by the coalition would be treated subject to the geneva conventions
3715448 for example prior to the invasion of iraq condi told cnn that iraqs aluminum tubes were only really suited for nuclear weapons and warned we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud but experts had already told her the tubes were for small artillery shells

3715451 the precarious geography of the mainstream media now that progressive thinkers have tuned out the idiot box and have begun to take over the internet where the agenda is being defined in the next century
3715452 the oval office is the kind of place where people stand outside theyre getting ready to come in and tell me what for and they walk in and get overwhelmed in the atmosphere and they say man youre looking pretty
3715453 he was the horse that brought us to the cliff so we might as well jump off the ledge and join him in the ditch because he has been at the helm long enough to realize that its best for us
3715454 now if youre a worker who earns 35 dollars a year over your lifetime and this system were in effect where you could put 4 percent of your payroll taxes in a personal account and you start at age 20 by the time you retire your personal account would grow to 250 000 thats compounding rate of interest
3715455 george w bush does not speak for me or my son or my mother or my friends or the people i respect in this world we didnt vote for these cheap greedy little killers who speak for america today and we will not vote for them again in 2002 or 2004 or ever who does vote for these dishonest shitheads
3715456 at the same time i shared a dark suspicion that the life we were leading was a lost cause that we were all actors kidding ourselves along on a senseless odyssey it was the tension between these two poles a restless idealism on the one hand and a sense of impending doom on the other that kept me going
3715457 at one point during the campaign i mentioned pat buchanan at mcgovern headquarters for some reason and rick stearns perhaps the most hardline left bent ideologue on mcgoverns staff sort of chuckled and said oh yeah were pretty good friends
3715458 we had two bags of grass seventy five pellets of mescaline five sheets of high powered blotter acid a salt shaker half full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers downers screamers laughers also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of budweiser a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls not that we needed all that for the trip but once you get locked in a serious drug collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can
3715459 i would feel real trapped in this life if i didnt know i could commit suicide at any time
3715460 by any accepted standard i have had more than nine lives i counted them up once and there were 13 times i almost and maybe should have died
3715461 nixon represents that dark venal and incurably violent side of the american character almost every other country in the world has learned to fear and despise
3715462 to hell with fun i shit on the chest of fun look what it did to charles manson he had too much fun no doubt about that so they put him away for life
3715463 domestic carnage now filled the whole year with feast days old men from the chimney nook the maiden from the busom of her love the mother from the cradle of her babe the warrior from the field all perished all friends enemies of all parties ages ranks head after head and never heads enough for those that bade them fall
3715464 democracy cant be bad for the middle east because it selected me
3715465 aint it all wine and roses from here on out
3715466 youve got about three weeks on this social security idea before guys like mccain and frist and lugar start running their mouths on the sunday shows and begin to leak evidence on all the indictable stuff you thought cheney washed under the rug
3715467 might as well be a string of redneck beads on dental floss
3715468 if we could succeed in getting some form of tort reform passed medical malpractice reform or any of part of that it would go a long ways toward taking away the muscle the financial muscle that they have
3715469 every one of the ideas for the most part has merits on its own so theyre defensible
3715470 but i think altogether this was devised as a karl rove grand plan to cement in place a republican governing coalition that could last for a generation or more
3715471 a perpetual and restless desire for power that ceaseth only in death
3715472 terror is nought but prompt severe inflexible justice it is therefore an emanation of virtue it is less a particular principle than a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to the most pressing needs of the fatherland
3715473 its one month after the anti life equation was released worldwide millions now toil as slaves of darkside while the justifier shock troops of apokolips lay waste to planet earth and hunt down its protectors the remaining free humans and superheroes are stationed around the world besieged within the walls of ten very familiar watchtowers as they fight a desperate losing battle against the triumphant forces of evil while green arrow and black canary attempt to deliver the secret of humanitys last hope across americas blasted wastelands the outsiders brave the horrors of the bludhaven bunker in search of batman the ultimate battle is coming but which heroes will become villain and vice versa and what part do the secret society have to play in the dawning of this new age of evil darkness is falling and death rules the day id this truly the end of the age of super heroes
3715474 dont blame my editors dc currently is run from the top down in a way that makes jim shooters aegis at marvel look like a hippie commune ive worked under tyrants and i can say that id prefer to work under a talented knowledgeable tyrant with a successful plan than a directionless gladhander with a ouija board any day of the week
3715475 at this time in my life with my babies and husband and home everything feels complete to me but i do feel like theres something left undone

3715481 we took the cat ferry over from bar harbor it was thanksgiving weekend 2002 we stayed the first night in yarmouth at the colony
3715482 dave fell in love with the town that evening when we went for a stroll along the waterfront in the vicinity of rudders along the rose bush lined water street he was so impressed to see such a pretty little town that wasnt brimming with visitors and that you could access the water without having to first elbow your way through the crowds
3715483 he always says hes been to more of nova scotia than he has maine
3715484 i really love the whole province having worked for nova scotia tourism from 1994 2005 i was able to travel all of it thanks to a great training opportunity known as product knowledge tours every little nook and cranny has so much to offer maybe not for everyone but i appreciate it all for that it is even a swamp can provide a great photo op if you see it in the right light
3715485 those were the days when you didnt think twice about having a bonfire on the beach harvesting fresh shellfish to make fresh chowder or spending way too many hours in the sun without sunscreen
3715486 canadians are taking advantage of a strong dollar and doing lots of cross border shopping
3715487 i believe the weak us dollar will play in our favor with the international market also gas is expensive for americans not canadians and europeans i was paying an equivalent of 5 07 us gallon canadian dollars in late april and its even more costly in the uk
3715488 i love the chance to try to educate those around me about canada and especially nova scotia i often refer to myself as an arrogant maritimer just because im very proud and im sure it gets on peoples last nerve
3715489 understanding of each others way of life are her reasons why

3715502 uh the thing is i dont have any place to store the bike so its going to have to go in your writing room for the winter
3715503 every time i sit down to an assignment im completely convinced that this is the time when all words fail this is the time when i realize that im a complete fraud who has somehow gotten by for nine years pretending to be a writer
3715504 but the thing is though i know whats happening and whats to come and often wince at what i actually wrote down the experience of hearing the story told by someone else actually changes it for the very first time since i started writing im having the partial experience of encountering my own work as a reader
3715505 i do not know that there is any oversight right now
3715506 we need to make sure we are funding all the right things because this is about educating our children and spending taxpayer dollars
3715507 in a lot of ways our education system really does drive decision making down to those locally elected school boards
3715508 we are concerned whenever schools are run on a for profit basis

3715510 it looks like the fruit and vegetable cart on the historic brooklyn heights
3715511 hes parked near a deli and a store that sells fruit
3715512 meanwhile local resident nicole knox who was stocking up on berries for her kids said the cart was a godsend with cheap prices such as watermelon for 3 grapes for 2 a pound and two tubs of blueberries for 4
3715513 everything else around here is so expensive i cant believe anybody would want it gone

3715524 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3715525 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3715526 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3715527 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3715528 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

3715530 the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence have forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent

3715532 there is a new atlas sound album almost completely finished

3715561 the game is a must win for us were not even thinking of any other result i know the usa will be a very dangerous opponent for us because they are one of the top teams at this competition and also because they will be playing for their lives but in the end what matters to us is victory no matter how it comes
3715562 the usa will be a tough opponent they are a very good team but were not afraid of anyone we just want to go out and get the job done
3715563 please let me do my job i have faith in them and they are doing the job given to them by the coaching crew please football is not all about fancy stuff but how well the players play as a team
3715564 i know they are some of them dream team players who are more skilful and please the crowd more than they promise and okoronkwo but in the end we have to look at the overall impact of individual players in the team
3715565 although well miss them i believe those that will replace them will still do a good job besides its even a good opportunity for the coach to try out other players
3715566 we have to beat nigeria nigeria plays well but well see them in beijing and work out a strategy to beat them

3715587 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurised assets remained limited in the second quarter we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3715588 we took advantage of the brief market rally in april to reduce our equity exposure nonetheless equity gains net of impairments were significantly below the exceptional levels realised last year combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline interest income in the banking business rose strongly despite competition for deposits risk costs increased but remained below over the cycle norms costs remained under control in mature markets while we continued to invest to support growth
3715589 all capital and leverage ratios are well within target the group has eur 3 9 billion of spare leverage capacity after the completion of ings eur 5 billion share buyback and the payment of last years final dividend in the second quarter in line with our policy to pay an interim dividend equal to half of the previous years total dividend our interim dividend has been set at eur 0 74 per share to be paid fully in cash
3715590 ing maintained its commercial growth in these challenging market circumstances the net new production of client balances was eur 29 6 billion in the quarter bringing the total to eur 1 482 billion growth was driven by a large increase in lending particularly at the wholesale bank in retail banking and ing direct we continued to grow savings despite strong competition for deposits sales of life insurance were up 8 8 excluding currency impacts as product innovation and expanded distribution helped compensate for lower demand for unit linked products
3715591 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009 we are executing our strategy in the context of this challenging environment by focussing on growing client balances while keeping a close eye on margins and expenses we continue to adapt our product range to meet our customers changing needs while investing to expand our distribution in growth markets in mature markets we are on track with the transformation projects at our retail banking businesses in the benelux and expense reductions at the dutch insurance business are now evident as markets remain volatile we will continue to manage our risk and capital with discipline while financial markets are expected to put pressure on results in the short term we are confident that ing will continue to create profitable growth for our shareholders over the long term through the breadth of our business and the strength of our franchise
3715592 president musharraf is not a suitable candidate for the post of president
3715593 and the third photo was of gandhiji with his spinning wheel
3715594 he put them up as a reminder for the work that needs to be done and the inspiration that carries him forward every day
3715595 if there is any doubt about his integrity and its not just that he is rumoured to make amazing dal although i have not tasted it yet but he really understands the struggle for social justice and civil rights
3715596 im not sure theres any issue where they differ as much as this sometimes we complain in politics that democrats and republicans run to the center and they copy each other with their proposals at least in health care we dont have to worry about that
3715597 our proposal is to give every family in america a 5 000 refundable tax credit and they take that tax credit and that money a refundable tax credit to go across state lines to go any place in america and go online and pick out the insurance policy they want
3715598 democrats want the government to make the choices thats a fundamental difference
3715599 but if youre one of the 45 million americans who dont have health insurance then you will have it available to you no one will be turned away because of a pre existing condition or illness
3715600 everyone will be able to buy into a new health insurance plan thats similar to the one that every federal employee from a postal worker in iowa to a congressman in washington currently has for themselves
3715601 while sen obama wants to build on top of the employer sponsored insurance system sen mccain wants to build away from it and move more people to the individual insurance market
3715602 the stock democratic health reform solution before bill clinton changed it was a play or pay employer mandate and thats exactly what barack obama has
3715603 and in 1992 the favorite gop solution was tax credits to buy private health insurance so a lot of things have happened in 16 years the health care system is much worse than it was but we pretty much have the same solutions that weve always had

3715616 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3715617 i agree with jobs that its absolutely necessary to include an emergency kill switch for apple to remotely remove malicious applications
3715618 its necessary because apples app store team clearly is not testing these applications adequately before theyre available for download in the app store
3715619 would you prefer apple to diligently test apps for security and quality even though the app store would grow at a slower rate or would you rather risk being harmed by malicious software while the iphone app list continues to grow exponentially
3715620 era un martes a las ocho de la noche cuando mi pap y yo llegamos a la casa despu s de trabajar nos encontramos con la amarga sorpresa de hallar a mi mam en un estado de inconciencia y respirando con dificultad

3715636 its so hypocritical for our parents to have worked so hard to give us a better life than they had then punish us for enjoying that better life
3715637 when there are children starving people dying and countries torn apart with war what gives you the right to simply enjoy the good life
3715638 resolve has you seeking the necessary tools and skills so you can secure your own destiny
3715639 now russians go home we go on to next round
3715640 i dont want to get into politics because this is the olympics but in my heart i wanted to beat the russians for sure

3715654 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3715655 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3715656 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
3715657 a journalist in action was killed by idf fire along with others not involved in the hostilities
3715658 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehavior i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3715659 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3715660 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3715661 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done

3715672 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed

3715677 my staff convinced me it would be a good idea maybe i need a new staff
3715678 it was an attempt to bring a little humor to a subject i take very seriously
3715679 my policy on the war on terror is similar to ronald reagan we win they lose
3715680 none of your civil liberties matter much after youre dead
3715681 ive opposed immoral experimentation done in the name of science
3715682 but his judicial philosophy was to not legislate from the bench whatever your personal opinion is or whatever you think public policy should be thats not your job there there are some people who have been judges who didnt quite get over the fact that they werent legislators anymore i dont think that was johns reputation
3715683 hes well regarded in republican circles for his ability to articulate an argument particularly on television
3715684 hes someone who gets media and that has helped his career when your colleagues see you doing that they want to promote you
3715685 it does not affect your life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle but that does not mean that its right now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife
3715686 i dont know if there is a cause and effect connection but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country
3715687 i wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public that it builds up and builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in engage in violence
3715688 hes really changed his political and philosophical outlook on governing he is being led and advised by a group of people that would rather have him taking votes that are divisive in his heart i dont think thats who he is but thats certainly who he has become hes always been a moderate or at least until he got elected i dont think he had those conservative ideologies ingrained in him until he went up to d c
3715689 what he might write in a decision on the texas supreme court may be very different than what he would do legislatively
3715690 there are a fairly limited number of issues where hes reached across the aisle
3715691 im not sure thats the best use of that money
3715692 i am a democrat but i cannot say no to sen cornyn because he has been good to us
3715693 the fact of the matter is he supported the expansion of s chip he just didnt support it to the level that rick noriega did
3715694 hes seen as one of the rising stars in the republican party
3715695 the future for him is bright in terms of republican leadership

3715704 some of them criminals are taken to the jails but because they belong to the commanders they pay money and are set free
3715705 families are trusting the security forces and reporting these incidents
3715706 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3715707 these days all these young girls are going to school and coming out of their houses these criminals chase after them

3715739 youll need a red a blue a yellow a tiger top
3715740 help karen help shes trying to kill me shes like dr mengele
3715741 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3715742 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3715743 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences
3715744 far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3715745 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3715746 that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3715747 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed

3715751 i had some weed in my purse i got pulled over they found it and charged me with trafficking
3715752 ill get him up change his diaper get him dressed nap again
3715753 im not sure theres any issue where they differ as much as this sometimes we complain in politics that democrats and republicans run to the center and they copy each other with their proposals at least in health care we dont have to worry about that
3715754 our proposal is to give every family in america a 5 000 refundable tax credit and they take that tax credit and that money a refundable tax credit to go across state lines to go any place in america and go online and pick out the insurance policy they want
3715755 democrats want the government to make the choices thats a fundamental difference
3715756 but if youre one of the 45 million americans who dont have health insurance then you will have it available to you no one will be turned away because of a pre existing condition or illness
3715757 everyone will be able to buy into a new health insurance plan thats similar to the one that every federal employee from a postal worker in iowa to a congressman in washington currently has for themselves
3715758 while sen obama wants to build on top of the employer sponsored insurance system sen mccain wants to build away from it and move more people to the individual insurance market
3715759 the stock democratic health reform solution before bill clinton changed it was a play or pay employer mandate and thats exactly what barack obama has
3715760 and in 1992 the favorite gop solution was tax credits to buy private health insurance so a lot of things have happened in 16 years the health care system is much worse than it was but we pretty much have the same solutions that weve always had

3715765 many times her hearing problem is misinterpreted as something else
3715766 shes always been committed to an inclusive policy with regard to environmental justice issues
3715767 at the very least show respect for all viewpoints in the future
3715768 flew off the handle and jumped out of her chair
3715769 ive known pat for a long time i walked for her when she ran for city council and supported her when she ran for the assembly and senate this is totally totally out of character for her
3715770 i was wondering how much longer they can keep this under cover i didnt want to be the one to blow the whistle
3715771 still she seemed fairly fragmented at that meeting it seems to be more than a hearing issue
3715772 shes very professional as a senator shes been in politics many years
3715773 chair committees participate in committees and present bills all of the business required of a senator
3715774 i did not intend to be aggressive disrespectful or vulgar
3715775 unfortunately my directness and poor choice of words may have left the wrong impression and were in hindsight inappropriate for a legislative hearing
3715776 to convey my sincerest apology and talk more about your concerns
3715777 i dont see anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3715778 they are to achieve the most theatric effects for the benefit of the whole performance the whole opening ceremony
3715779 theres not a sentence in this world long enough for jon phillips
3715780 he turned to the two weapons of choice he turned to food and a closet
3715781 its a case of medical neglect or failure to provide medical care but not murder
3715782 life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes dont resist them that only creates sorrow let reality be reality let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like
3715783 you must not lose faith in humanity humanity is an ocean if a few drops of the ocean are dirty the ocean does not become dirty
3715784 no i am just here to look around a bit and take notes
3715785 well youd better steer clear of the garden master then
3715786 yes i have already heard about this garden master from some of the other people here this morning i will be very very careful
3715787 i am an environmental studies major at the university i am working on a paper about urban sustainability and today i am gathering data on how community gardens function within an urban sitting
3715788 do you have a few minutes to answer some questions
3715789 bella you cant go running around now you know the rules no running allowed you sure are handful today
3715790 delia this is bengta andersson a student doing some research in our garden bengta delia lopez
3715791 delia grows the sweetest tomatoes in the garden one of her cherokee purples and a shaker of salt is all you need shes got the touch too there is nothing she cant grow and theres always plenty of it
3715792 shes talking me up so ill give her some of my heirloom seeds next spring
3715793 oh i just thought of something you should interview delia what she does is so cool after she gives away bushels of produce to all her friends and family she gives whats left over to the food pantry at st fiacres church
3715794 well sometimes theyre the only fresh fruits and vegetables available to the homeless people
3715795 and i know the garden master thinks im selling this stuff to the church i love watching him run around trying to prove that ive violated the non commercial clause
3715796 is that who i think it is is that etsuko nakahara of nakahara enterprises
3715797 bingo though she doesnt really have much to do with the business anymore her daughters and grandkids run the show now
3715798 but do you know what shes done she and her husband pioneered concentrated gardening techniques in this country they revolutionized the whole concept of growing the maximum amount of food on the smallest area of land amazing can you introduce her to me
3715799 sure its your lucky day we dont see her very much now she has this huge home in the valley but she and her husband started the garden years ago and i think she has a fondness for the place she usually sends a grandkid once a week to weed and water her flowers
3715800 you like my new garden seat i can come now and sit with my flowers
3715801 hey etty did you get your permission slip from the garden master to bring in furniture
3715802 he yelled at me he said i was a bad girl
3715803 you delia is this your kid do you realize that she almost knocked over mr schlessman youve been warned about this before
3715804 fred who do you think you are to yell at my kid you got a problem you bring it to me you do not pick on a 5 year old got it
3715805 this is the final straw this is your third citation and you are out of here
3715806 marji used to love it when you brought them to her
3715807 uh nothing really no time you know with garden business and all
3715808 i just mulch it a bit maybe grow some rye grass to turn under again
3715809 you have been out of the garden for too long
3715810 you should go back and plant something i can help you i will send one of the boys over with some bedding plants
3715811 wait what just happened here are you going to let that little toad get away with talking to bella like that
3715812 well get him fired as garden master get rid of some of his rules
3715813 why hes a good manager and we need the rules
3715814 well yeah if we didnt have them people would be doing all sorts of stupid things you know like a couple of weeks ago someone actually threw nut sedge into the compost pile what an idiot
3715815 hes really a good guy he just lost his way a little bit he needs to remember why he is in the garden
3715816 this is what it is all about paula this is all that matters come on lets finish what you started
3715817 what an evil destination except the weak ones among men women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they able to direct their way al nisa 4 97 98
3715818 such as medical treatment trade and learning specialized skills that cannot be obtained in any other way
3715819 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3715820 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3715821 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3715822 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3715823 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3715824 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3715825 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3715826 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3715827 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3715828 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3715829 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3715830 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3715831 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3715832 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3715833 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3715834 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3715835 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3715836 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3715837 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3715838 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3715839 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3715840 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3715841 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3715842 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3715843 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3715844 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3715845 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
3715846 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
3715847 she has family members with her at the beijing hospital and shes able to interact with them during brief visits several times a day
3715848 hugh and elisabeth and other family members who have come to beijing since the tragedy this past saturday are with her
3715849 in most situations including this one the fbi does not conduct investigations overseas but can often monitor an investigation when invited by the local authorities
3715850 we dont think it is going to have any effect on the olympic games itself
3715851 we should not have any greater threat on any delegations at the games

3715900 the institutes want to respond strongly to the increase this year in cao applicants the real short and medium term issue for institutes of technology is providing quality courses for these students cuts will have a negative impact on the range and number of programmes available
3715901 ioti is also dismayed that while the student services fee is being increased this year from 825 to 900 75 per cent of the increased revenue is being clawed back by the department this is a particularly negative development since this fee income is used exclusively for student services such as counselling and health which will now be curtailed
3715902 most of those who got their results today will now be awaiting cao offers with some anxiety
3715903 i hope that nobody will be deterred from entering third level by minister okeeffes proposal and the best contribution he could make to ensuring that these students fulfill their full educational potential is to drop this crazy plan

3715939 the theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence abolition of private property we communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a mans own labor which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom activity and independence capital is not only personal it is a social power when therefore capital is converted into common property it is only the social character of the property that is changed it loses its class character

3715975 in terms of the conservative constituency of the republican party sen mccain is an opportunistic infection that threatens to ravage and destroy its defenseless body tragically for america in the larger context of our national political life he still plays the role of the aids virus masquerading as a republican while opening the way for barack obama the opportunistic infection that will ravage the defenseless body of our republic
3715976 well unfortunately we are all a bit suspicious that this is actually a smoke screen to actually keep the judges out and actually play for time because this impeachment could be a drawn out process and in that there is an equal chance that musharraf might survive that because there are only about 10 members of parliament that need to go on the other side for this whole impeachment effort to fail
3715977 it would be a straightforward thing of immediately annulling nullifying musharrafs election as the president while he was still the army chief
3715978 so therefore if the judges were restored then musharraf would go but they the ruling coalition are not restoring the judges and instead going the wrong way round
3715979 he zardari has been given amnesty off all his corruption cases worth billions of dollars and in return the quid pro quo is that zardari saves musharraf and rather than getting the judges reinstated if he were sincere he would just get the judges reinstated who are still the constitutional judges of pakistan but he is stalling on that he is making every excuse not to get the judgesack
3715980 our history shows that once the army chief retires which musharraf did last november then its case of the king is dead long live the king and they serve their own institution i dont think they are going to stand by him
3715981 i find the whole thing quite strange that the isi is supposed to be patronizing these militants on the other hand these militants have been killing not just the soldiers and police but actually they have blown up two isi buses killing isi personnel right in the heart of the ghq in pindi
3715982 in my opinion what is a more accurate picture is that the militant groups that were trained by the cia and isi during the afghan jihad against the soviets and who after the soviet occupation the groups that were used by isi in kashmir and afghanistan they have gone out of control or the ideological element in these groups has gone out of control because they were indoctrinated to fight foreign occupation
3715983 they backed one man against 160 million people and they kept backing him right through all the unconstitutional acts he kept doing they still kept backing him they backed him they paid lip service to him that he shouldnt have imposed the emergency but when the illegal and unconstitutional election was announced they quickly backed him again
3715984 the us standing with the military dictator has actually harmed the image of the us it has raised anti americanism in our country because here the people who were watching a military dictator using the army to kill their own people
3715985 now it is the most rugged mountainous terrain so for any pakistan head of state giving any guarantees to the us that they will be able to stop these tribes half are on one side of the border half are on the other side and there is no border theres never been a border the way to have tackled it was through dialogue through winning the tribesman over to their side
3715986 the tribes have nothing to do with al qaeda or taliban they should have won them over to their side rather than indiscriminately bombing them aerial bombing bombs not knowing or differentiating between women children and terrorists and the collateral damage pushing the tribes on to the other side and its a huge mess being created their and they need to change strategy

3716261 i would have taken this week off but i thought id get away from all the ryder cup mayhem at home and have some fun in sweden
3716262 i think ive made a good stance for my place already but im hoping to go back and have two more really good weeks before paul decides on his four wild cards
3716263 there are four or five guys figuring for four spots but i know paul will pick the four he thinks will do best for the team he wont have favourites
3716264 i guess if i win this week it would impress the captain
3716265 montgomeries statistics show that he is different class when it comes to ryder cup and clarke and casey have so much more experience than me
3716266 they know its a sport you have to be passionate about because you dont get any money its very expensive and its very hard work for very little return
3716267 i started despite my father because my younger brother started and i had this feeling that i had to take care of him

3716270 back in college when me and my roommates would get hammered and rap along to victory id yell to no one in particular that this was one of the 10 greatest hip hop songs of all time while clutching a quart of mickeys ice in one hand and a half eaten totinos party pizza in the other well just so you know heres a partial list of other things i thought were pretty great back then drunk driving self immolation ramen noodles the wwf billy breathes and the career prospects of florida gators qb jesse palmer a k a the guy who ended up on the bachelor

3716272 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
3716273 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
3716274 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
3716275 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
3716276 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
3716277 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver
3716278 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3716279 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3716280 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3716281 and to win a medal its just indescribable i cant tell you how proud i am
3716282 any time we can get a u s athlete on the podium it just helps the sport in general and hopefully motivates others at home that they can do it as well were role models for the sport of cycling which is important in america and its really special to have two of us on the podium i cant wait to celebrate with him tonight
3716283 it was great to see i know how hard shes worked
3716284 i knew i shouldnt be sitting down on the ground but i just needed to stop for a second and collect my thoughts catch my breath get some water down there were three or four of us really battling there for third place its a big relief its a great feeling
3716285 to me you are perfect and my wasted heart will love you until you look like this
3716286 you will look back on the things you laughed and you will cry
3716287 introduction to the capability maturity model integration version 1 2
3716288 as a person from a military family im absolutely against the war and i want th war to be over as soon as possible however i think russia was ight to send its troops to help south ossetia and russian peacekeepers in the region to deal with georgian aggression it was done legally as for the georgian attack on south ossetia i think it was a very well planned provocation and and as a journalism student im very disapponted by the misinformation in the western media about the conflict the experts say that such misinformation is in the interest of thee republican candidate for the american presidency john mccain therefore they western media support georgia in all possible ways
3716289 i think its very hard to know objectively what is happening in south ossetia in order to be 100 sure about it one probably has to go there on thee whole it was georgia who attacked first but honestly i dont know the reasons why i think george was wrong at the same time i can entertain the thought that the russian side could also be doing something not correctly enough as for russia sending its troops to south ossetia i think russia just didnt have any other choice in both military and diplomatic terms as for the way the western mass media covers the conflict it is the usual story as the western media usually covers the events in russia not objectively but from one point of view that is because a strong russia is not in the interests of the west
3716290 its very sad whats happening in south ossetia im very sorry for south ossetias people russia was right to send its troops to south ossetia because it needed to defend the peacekeepers and civilians who are mainly russian citizens as for the western media coverage of the conflict its part of the information war and a apart of the attack on russia the conflict is in the interests not only of georgia but also of the united states who wants to surround russia with radars dictate its policy and want to have a unipolar world

3716298 last week todd shared with me that his wife had returned to canada and hes following her this week ive been assured by his people that there is no third party involved
3716299 a large segment of the movement has been skeptical from day one theyre going to see this as a natural progression others who have been following todd are going to be spiritually shipwrecked weve most definitely seen through this revival a lot of people are not grounded in scripture so for them it wont be an issue

3716308 the effect of cblis compound on limb recovery in our animal model of tourniquet induced injury is encouraging and the efficacy with which it protects warrants continued investigation
3716309 these results will allow us to project the potential use of this compound for multiple applications beyond tourniquet injury from kidney and heart ischemia to reducing the rapid inflammation normally observed in transplanted organs exploring all situations with similar mechanisms of tissue injury
3716310 the fact that protectan cblb502 demonstrated results even after the removal of a tourniquet could make it particularly practical for battlefield conditions or other types of civilian emergency use since it can be applied after an injured subject is delivered to the site of treatment

3716424 we went into that year and our training camp was so much easier and we thought we were a lot better than we were
3716425 its different this year every time ive been on a team that has won there has been a sense of urgency and i feel the sense of urgency here when ive been on a team that thinks were really good we end up doing really bad i think every team that has been successful has had something to prove and we do hopefully we can keep that edge we have a lot of people doubting us already thats good in a sense because its going to help keep us down to earth
3716426 i think that everyone is competing hard and i think we have a lot of ways to go
3716427 i dont think anybody was really happy with the way we played against detroit a 13 10 loss so hopefully we will come out and have a lot better week than we did last week
3716428 its always fun because youre always with a new team you have to get to know your teammates and stuff like that so its always new
3716429 you still catch the ball after practice and sit in the ice tub which is something i dont really enjoy but its something in camp that you have get used to
3716430 i dont really like the new force out rule because if they want to see points on the board its going to take away a lot of catches
3716431 i think its going to be more of an advantage to the defense
3716432 i think its fixing something that doesnt really need to be fixed i didnt think there was a big problem with the force out rule its a fair rule if you could come down in bounds it should be a judgment call on whether you can stay in but now they are taking the judgment away from everybody
3716433 i feel uncomfortable but he burress has proven that he can do it without practicing i just hope that eli manning is able to keep the timing down with him the interesting thing is going to be getting that timing back since the both of us have missed some time
3716434 im definitely excited to see whats going to go on this year
3716435 we have a lot of change on our team a lot of young guys that need to take the place of people that did really well last year and we have some free agents as well that have to come in and do well
3716436 it may well be that the connection between riches and happiness is looser than most economic and political commentators

3716444 i joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy being personally opposed to drug use but open minded about the best way to deal with the problem i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise
3716445 no significant lasting impact on the availability affordability or use of drugs
3716446 the argument always put forward against this is that there would be a commensurate increase in drug use as a result of legalisation
3716447 this it seems to me is a bogus point tobacco is a legal drug whose use is declining and precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation than they would be were it illegal
3716448 the idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is simply ridiculous

3716462 this is indeed the fact given that wealth is generated by business but the rwandan business sector has also to change its mindset

3716470 structure is highly conserved capturing information that is evolutionarily deep
3716471 it was only logical to focus on transfer rna a molecule that is believed to be very ancient and is truly central to the entire protein synthesis machinery
3716472 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function

3716478 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3716479 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3716480 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3716481 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3716482 there has been significant geopolitical activity but its not our role to upset it
3716483 jika mereka bertaubat mendirikan shalat dan menunaikan zakat maka mereka itu adalah saudara saudaramu seagama
3716484 aku khawatir tidak halal bagi laki laki suami diam bersama isteri yang tidak melakukan shalat tidak mandi jinabah dan tidak mempelajari
3716485 sesungguhnya orang orang munafik itu menipu allah dan allah akan membalas tipuan mereka dan apabila mereka berdiri untuk shalat mereka berdiri dengan malas mereka bermaksud riya dengan shalat di hadapan manusia dan tidaklah mereka menyebut allah melainkan sedikit sekali
3716486 aku betul betul melihat tidak seorang pun di antara kami yang tidak melakukannya shalat berjamaah selain orang yang munafik tulen bahkan ada seorang yang sampai bergelayut di antara dua orang disam pingnya agar dapat berdiri di dalam shaf karena ia masih sakit
3716487 ketahuilah bahwa suul khatimah semoga allah melindungi kita darinya tidak akan terjadi terhadap orang yang kondisi lahiriahnya lurus istiqamah dan batinnya baik alhamdulillah hal seperti ini tidak pernah didengar dan tidak ada yang mengetahui pernah terjadi tetapi ia terjadi terhadap orang yang akalnya rusak dan ngotot melakukan dosa besar bisa jadi kondisi seperti itu menguasainya lalu kematian menjem putnya sebelum sempat bertaubat maka syaithan pun memperdayainya ketika itu nauudzu billah atau dapat terjadi juga terhadap orang yang semula kondisinya istiqamah namun kemudian berubah dan keluar dari kebiasaannya lalu terus berjalan ke arah itu sehingga menjadi sebab suul khatimah baginya

3716489 tahukah kamu apa neraka saqar itu saqar itu tidak meninggalkan dan tidak membiarkan neraka saqar adalah pembakar kulit manusia di atasnya ada sembilan belas malaikat penjaga
3716490 tiap tiap diri bertanggung jawab atas apa yang telah diperbuatnya kecuali golongan kanan berada di dalam surga mereka tanya menanya tentang keadaan orang orang yang berdosa apakah yang memasukkan kamu ke dalam neraka saqar mereka menjawab kami dahulu tidak termasuk orang orang yang mengerjakan shalat dan kami tidak pula memberi makan orang miskin dan adalah kami membicarakan yang bathil bersama orang orang yang membicarakannya
3716491 tidaklah tiga orang yang berada di suatu perkampungan ataupun di pedalaman lalu tidak mendirikan shalat di antara sesama mereka melainkan syaithan akan mempecundangi mereka karena itu hendaklah kalian bersama jamaah sebab srigala hanya memakan kambing yang sendirian
3716492 syaithan adalah srigala atas manusia yang merupakan musuh bebuyutannya maka sebagaimana burung yang semakin berada di ketinggian semakin jauh dari petaka sebaliknya semakin berada di tempat rendah petaka akan mengintainya demikian pula halnya dengan kambing yang semakin dekat dengan penggembalanya semakin terjaga keselamatannya semakin ia menjauh semakin terancam bahaya
3716493 sesungguhnya seorang hamba melakukan shalat dan dan tidaklah dia mendapatkan pahala shalatnya kecuali sepersepuluhnya sepersembilannya seperdelapannya sepertujuhnya seperenamnya seperlimanya seperempatnya sepertiganya atau setengahnya
3716494 jika kalian berdiri untuk shalat maka shalatlah seperti shalatnya orang yang akan meninggalkan dunia

3716506 the prime minister of new zealand angrily denounced israel and imposed diplomatic sanctions on it after two suspected mossad agents were jailed for six months for trying on false grounds to obtain a new zealand passport the plot which involved obtaining a passport in the name of a tetraplegic man who had not spoken in years provoked a furious reaction yesterday
3716507 in 2004 new zealand authorities became aware of a covert operation mounted by israels external intelligence agency mossad to secure nz passports which are keenly sought after by those who seek hassle free entry to most countries
3716508 the spy ring consisted of at least three mossad agents working from australia it later emerged that australia secretly expelled an israeli diplomat as a result of this scandal in nz and one new zealand jew

3716520 mey selections has been popular with our customers over the past three years the brand has experienced growth of more than 60 per cent year on year in our stores and over 13 million sainsburys customers have bought its products from us as consumers increasingly feel the pinch on their household budgets and dine out less the demand for high quality food to cook at home is strong with mey selections customers can have restaurant quality meals at home

3716539 this was between the georgian government and a private israeli company they have provided highly qualified training
3716540 at this stage i wouldnt expect much other than to provide political support for georgias case
3716541 israel probably understands our situation more than others but i wouldnt expect more than diplomatic support
3716542 the jewish community is an integral part of georgia we are all part of this country
3716543 we have the russian air force bombing civilian targets the russian army invading our territory and the russian navy blocking our ports
3716544 georgia will recover and regain its territory if not tomorrow than the day after tomorrow we have patience and determination but what will happen with the russian federation even the russian people should realize that they have gotten into a very deep problem
3716545 international mediators are trying to address this issue but not much is being done beyond talking and naming and shaming we will reach an agreement but time matters

3716548 you will never hear the russian media talk about their own casualties we shot down 13 aircraft and not all of the pilots can be alive they have suffered heavy casualties in human lives and damage to armored carriers and tanks which they are hiding
3716549 the russian media is so manipulated we were forced to shut it down in georgia because this is part of the international warfare the war here is on three fronts the guns and aircraft the media war and the diplomatic war
3716550 the database used by the rpw contained an error in the address field causing valid addresses to be unrecognized

3716553 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3716554 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3716555 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3716556 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3716574 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3716575 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3716576 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3716577 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3716578 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3716606 it was solid work i thought there were enough game changing plays on both sides of the ball i was hoping for a little bit more from the veteran standpoint we decided to hold larod stephens howling and bill stull they both could have gone if we would have played a game today they both would have played we limited lesean mccoy he had 11 carries averaged six yards a carry i was very pleased with him except his one turnover id like to say it was an outstanding day of football but we turned the ball over he ran good he made guys miss chris burns looked good the returners looked good and all the running backs jonathan baldwin made three great plays he made two by the sideline unfortunately both of them were out of bounds its pretty evident that we need to find a way to get him ready to go he has a chance to help us andrew taglianetti keeps showing up from a defensive standpoint were going to start working him on special teams he can really help us in that area overall solid scrimmage we didnt get anyone really hurt today but we have a lot of work to do

3716616 she couldnt go once she couldnt go twice and in my opinion it was intentional
3716617 i thought my feet were under me on that arabian and the next thing i knew i was on my back

3716644 due to a drop in us shares on continued weakness in the financial sector
3716645 the government has already virtually announced that the economy is in a recession period so negative growth numbers have only limited impact on market sentiment
3716646 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurised assets remained limited in the second quarter
3716647 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3716648 equity gains net of impairments were significantly below the exceptional levels realised last year
3716649 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3716650 the group has 3 9 billion euros of spare leverage capacity after the completion of ings five billion euro share buyback and the payment of last years final dividend in the second quarter
3716651 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009
3716652 first they called her name up then they did not even put her name up even though the chinese had finished it was totally unusual holding
3716653 she was mentally prepared and then she had a mental break then after not doing the job the beam on the floor exercise her concentration was bothered
3716654 its a normal television thing thats typical in international competition
3716655 i dont know if martha knew exactly the details of what was happening when she said that
3716656 i think everybody knows therell be good days and bad days i just wish this was a good day for me
3716657 i tried to adjust in the air but i really couldnt save it she said
3716658 i tried to step back and there was just nothing
3716659 i guess it was just a little bit too hard to get out of that funk it affected me on floor a little bit
3716660 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on the road but they did hold me for quite some time and i guess i lost my nerve a little bit
3716661 if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here
3716662 when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3716663 its one of those things you have to go with
3716664 he just said youve got great range on the ball
3716665 the fans you see theyre very upbeat and energized and its lifted the defense up too
3716666 hes a hard worker hes a winner and we have to compete with that
3716667 i like to get an early jump on quarterbacks sometimes and with him hell be looking one way and the next thing you know hes coming back the other way he keeps you honest and i think thats probably the best thing for us in the secondary you cant really cheat
3716668 its hard work you know hes going to sling the ball in there tight and he has that quick release so you know you just have to match up with your receivers tight but he just throws the ball hard and even theres some nice balls that he throws that he can get in tight spots
3716669 hey going through this whole process i didnt think brett favre would be in a jet uniform when he was going through all that stuff with the packers just to see him here and hes on our team were happy to have him the fans theyre energetic and theyre happy for him too
3716670 who cares brett favre is over there whether or not were pushed to the back burner i still have a family to feed im still going to go out there and play as hard as i can he has absolutely nothing to do with the new york giants
3716671 guys arent satisfied with what weve done and were hungry to do something special
3716672 to be honest we lost some really good players but we feel like we filled some holes you cant replace strahan because hes a hall of famer but we have a combination of players who we think we can replace him with its still a strong core of players coming back from last years team
3716673 we saw what that could do for us last year
3716674 lets just put it this way weve got a chance to have a really good football team again
3716675 if it gives players a burr under their saddles great
3716676 i do know that in this league theres a fine line between 3 13 and 13 3 but when you support each other good things happen i think they saw that last year i think this team will be focused
3716677 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3716678 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
3716679 were very happy with how he tackled and how he performed against detroit
3716680 hes a very patient player with very good footwork and he works at it all the time hes very meticulous in what he does
3716681 you can guard a wide receiver but if you can beat two people on one play theres no better feeling
3716682 its desire you can teach all the technique but its two grown men in front of you and theres just one of you and they know what you are doing and somehow you have to beat them down the field if you can do that theres no better victory
3716683 i told the coaches when i got here that i have a swagger at gunner
3716684 i dont get blocked double teams triple teams i beat them
3716685 show them that it wasnt a fluke and im here to contribute any way i can
3716686 there was a lot of humidity in the airport area the plane circled twice over the landing zone eventually hit a telephone line two kilometres away and crashed
3716687 we rushed to the scene but unfortunately we couldnt find anybody alive we collected the burnt remains of three people
3716688 we discovered the bodies of three men and they seem to be the crew of the plane

3716690 there was a lot of humidity around the airport area the plane circled twice around the landing zone and hit the telecommunication tower two kilometres away and crashed

3716695 people say i am against reconciliation the issue is not political its based on the constitution i am committed to reconciliation
3716696 its not out of love or hate for mohamed dheere that i reinstated him i can be replaced mohamed dheere can be replaced but the constitution cannot be changed
3716697 i hope the opposition will join the government so that somalia can get a political settlement

3716728 ipnetzone has come to rely on linmin for both the provisioning and imaging of servers in our various co location sites
3716729 linmins new api will enable us to offer even better responsiveness to customer requests for additional and or differently configured linux and windows servers
3716730 having a best of breed provisioning and imaging solution was a great starting point but being a standalone product didnt maximize the potential of linmin bare metal provisioning now with the new linmin api customers can optimize it resources physical virtual and human around business processes not the other way around
3716731 linmins ability to install applications and management agents during the provisioning process is even more valuable with the api bringing a closed loop process to customers existing environments automatically select an appropriate and available physical or virtual system invoke the linmin api and after the system is provisioned these agents identify themselves to their respective management monitoring policy enforcement availability compliance and other applications that then take control of the system this is it application integration at its best
3716732 even though second quarter sales were higher this year than last substantial increases in raw materials transportation and energy costs have resulted in earnings for the last two quarters being comparable
3716733 we anticipate that sales and earnings for the second half of the year will continue at a higher rate than in 2007
3716734 most of the time you dont have any type of serious injury
3716735 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of species distributions
3716736 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
3716737 when modeling species distributions it is important to consider a large amount of climatic data and evaluate the methods used especially when dealing with important issues such as invasive species whose ecological limitations may not be immediately obvious
3716738 snakes already get an unwarranted bad reputation and the last thing needed in our current biodiversity crisis is to drum up more hatred of these animals by suggesting an impending full scale north american invasion by pythons when properly constructed climate models suggest the opposite

3716745 its possible to make an attack via javascript code or just tcp ip packets storms against intel based machines some of the bugs that will be shown are exploitable via common instruction sequences and by knowing the mechanics behind certain jit java compilers attackers can force the compiler to do what they want for example short nested loops lead to system crashes on many cpus

3716750 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna
3716751 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3716752 this method coupled with adsorbed soil gas and carbon isotope studies suggests that hydrocarbon micro seepage of subsurface origin is present in the area and indicates that the area is worth visiting for conventional petroleum exploration
3716753 we plan to carry out detailed soil sampling in the region after the rains
3716754 it can be integrated with geological geochemical and geophysical methods to evaluate the hydrocarbon prospect of an area and to prioritize the drilling locations thereby reducing drilling risks
3716755 the geological and geophysical studies reveal that tadpatri shales can be a potential source rocks for hydrocarbons having the essential prerequisites such as their undisturbed nature favourable for the generation and accumulation of hydrocarbons

3716767 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3716768 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3716769 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3716770 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3716771 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3716772 the biggest challenge for open source or any other kind of software development for that matter is finding the right information to solve a problem adding automatic hardware tagging to our search data not only improves the relevance of our support but also gives it developers the most reliable information faster and with the analytical tools to make the right decision based on their exact environment no phone calls into support no trouble tickets just search on your desktop
3716773 our innovations in search technology combined with our sophisticated data gathering and diagnostics tools free technologists from waiting on hold for minutes or hours for support

3716776 fire eagle is a way for people to take their location to the web
3716777 essentially fire eagle is nothing more nothing less than a store for a users location
3716778 whats more interesting is how it works as a switchboard
3716779 fire eagle solved all the hard problems with location for us
3716780 it makes it easier for bloggers to have correct location information on their blog within their posts being able to geo tag their content
3716781 obviously fire eagle is crucial to the success of what were trying to do
3716782 there are other tools that identify location but none that do it in specifically this way
3716783 the attention to privacy is noteworthy as is the concept behind fire eagle the challenge will be to build user awareness and adoption in the near term
3716784 based on ongoing assessments of vaccine safety information the fda and cdc continue to find that gardasil is a safe and effective vaccine
3716785 believes that no safety issue related to the vaccine has been identified these types of events are events that could also be seen in the general population even in the absence of vaccination
3716786 if you are at all concerned then dont have the vaccine have regular pap smears and you will be equally protected from cervical cancer
3716787 the availability of the safest least toxic most advance vaccines that can be produced as a health care option for anybody who wants to use them
3716788 this is striking as gardasil isnt a mandatory vaccine while many other childhood vaccines are but we dont know what this means
3716789 these include reports of injury and death and we are seeing a pattern of what we have termed atypical collapse
3716790 these include cases where a girl suddenly passes into unconsciousness either immediately or within 24 hours of vaccination and then revives feeling weak and unable to speak properly or exhibiting other neurological signs what we are concerned about is that girls are not aware of this possibility and could be crossing the road or driving a car and suddenly pass out
3716791 since almost all of the energy available on earth comes from the sun we should probably think about how close and how simply we can connect ourselves to that power source
3716792 conservative leaning think tank exchange policy argues that a mass internal migration is the only solution to a decade of failed efforts to regenerate northern cities
3716793 if you reward everyone there will not be enough to go around so you offer a reward to one in order to encourage everyone
3716794 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3716795 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3716796 its been three years and i need to get back in here
3716797 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time
3716798 but getting people back into hard hit neighborhoods is one of the challenges we still face
3716799 people wont come back unless there are jobs for them while companies arent going to move here unless there are people to work for them
3716800 the worst affected are people in the lower income brackets who dont know how to navigate their way through the system where the rules seem to change from day to day
3716801 unfortunately this is a state program and i simply cant get rid of all the bureaucracy
3716802 but i can streamline the processes and tighten deadlines to make the program run faster
3716803 this will not be a city of half a million people again for a very long time the best way forward is to let go of the past and look to a different future
3716804 new orleans has all its eggs in one basket and we need to move away from that
3716805 we have to give people a reason to come here
3716806 if we show them the neighborhood is alive and we are pursuing a path of sustainable development that is a step in the right direction
3716807 conservative leaning think tank exchange policy argues that a mass internal migration is the only solution to a decade of failed efforts to regenerate northern cities

3716841 there is so much emphasis put on website design whereas i think the photography trumps all that

3716880 we want to be good stewards of this land and environment and the much needed funds we will raise through the sale of condor syrah will raise awareness and interest in this special highly endangered bird
3716881 the condor is an endangered species and there are only 315 currently in existence with over half of the wild flock of condors in california located in central california
3716882 preservation efforts in that area are imperative for the continued recovery of this highly endangered bird because there are so few places left in the world where condors can survive

3716905 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3716906 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3716907 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3716932 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3716933 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3716934 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3716935 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3716936 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3716937 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3716938 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3716939 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3716940 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3716941 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3716942 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3716943 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3716944 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3716945 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3716946 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3716947 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3716948 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3716949 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3716950 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3716951 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3716952 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3716953 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3716954 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3716955 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3716966 the summer colloquium has been terrific ive been interested in research since i was a freshman and prof aalberts is giving me a tremendous amount of support and i feel real accountability for the research
3716967 they teach you a lot about time management and about how to fully utilize college resources
3716968 what strikes me is how the play changes when a white man plays the part of othello
3716969 this program is geared to people who want to pursue ph d s and i think this will help with the transition to graduate school
3716970 the students become part of a talented highly motivated cohort
3716971 all are considering graduate studies and teaching careers the college has really organized and refined this program ive never seen a better thought out well run program
3716972 with the long time line tan is able to explore other elements of the subject and focus her inquiry
3716973 its a great opportunity for me to meet with a gifted student and a wonderful way to encourage students to consider the life of the mind
3716974 they work together they bounce ideas they discuss their papers
3716975 at the end these students will know more they are the experts on their topic
3716976 first they provide a terrific incentive to encourage students that are traditionally underrepresented in academia to think about doing original research and becoming active scholars who have the potential to make real contributions to the fields in which they are interested

3716982 the company plans to produce and market its carbonless power system for green electricity in stationary facilities
3716983 while developments of hydrogen powered vehicles are still progressing there is a compelling need and desire from our customers for a parallel initiative to bring clean hydrogen fueled stationary electrical power to the market
3716984 paradoxically hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but it is not readily available on earth and has to be produced by chemical industry manufacturing systems
3716985 from wastes the plasma converter can actually be the source of startech hydrogen on site and in house for our customers
3716986 when hydrogen as a fuel combines with air the principal resulting product is h2o water
3716987 last summer the company successfully completed a three year contract for the us department of energy in its hydrogen initiative in a comprehensive program demonstrating the production of hydrogen from processing wastes in the plasma converter followed by our starcell tm system starcell is the companys proprietary membrane technology system that separates the hydrogen from the pcg synthesis gas produced by the plasma converter system

3717003 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3717004 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3717005 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3717006 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3717007 its been three years and i need to get back in here
3717008 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time
3717009 but getting people back into hard hit neighborhoods is one of the challenges we still face
3717010 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3717011 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3717012 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3717013 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3717014 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3717015 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3717016 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3717017 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3717018 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3717019 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3717020 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3717023 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3717024 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3717033 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3717034 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3717035 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3717036 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3717037 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3717038 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3717039 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

3717058 for this liberalism the basic units of political life are not discursive and reflective persons nor friends and enemies nor patriotic soldier citizens nor energetic litigants but the weak and the powerful and the freedom it wishes to secure is freedom from the abuse of power and the intimidation of the defenceless that this difference invites the liberalism of fear regards abuses of public powers in all regimes with equal trepidation it worries about the excesses of official agents at every level of government and it assumes that these are apt to burden the poor and the weak most heavily the history of the poor compared to that of various elites makes that obvious enough the assumption amply justified on every page of political history is that some agents of government will behave lawlessly and brutally in small or big ways most of the time unless they are prevented from doing so

3717087 one womens rights issue conspicuously missing from our list abortion

3717183 frankly the political conversation moves too fast these days for the print edition
3717184 now i can be part of that conversation in real time beyond that we have some marvelous strengths at the oregonian that we can bring to the political blogging business we come across way more information than we can get into print and listen closely here we dont have an axe to grind i intend to be the same honest broker of information ive always been except now i can let you in on a lot more of what ive learned
3717185 besides original reporting i look for lots of links to interesting stuff that i think the politically aware northwesterner ought to know about

3717206 these outdoor concerts give us an opportunity to give back to the community and present great music in informal outdoor settings
3717207 this kind of exposure is important for the work of our researchers
3717208 we need open lines of communication with agencies that fund our research we want to keep them informed about the results in a variety of ways beyond formal reports these stories are an effective way to show in a very personal way just how important their funding and the resulting research are to us and to the people of the nation and the world
3717209 a lot of times stories about scientists or engineers get framed in certain ways
3717210 stereotypes are applied or views are pigeonholed the idea here is to give a little bit of behind the scenes background on what they actually do day to day
3717211 what we sought to do with our experiment was to control some of the rational reasons like unfair pricing why people wouldnt buy annuities
3717212 by getting get rid of all these rational reasons we were able to focus on other reasons
3717213 we wanted to make sure that we captured every possible variable that might explain what people did in the experiment
3717214 basically whatever five minute presentation people saw that pretty much governed the choice that they made
3717215 so in other words we were able to push people in one direction or another based on a five minute marketing presentation
3717216 were going into this area now and saying look take something as simple as telling people they could lose money in the stock market if you highlight what their losses could be then theyre going to be more likely to not want to do that and theyre going to flip over and do the annuity instead
3717217 how do you get someone to get a colonoscopy emphasize that you can die if you dont get it

3717220 men are affected by both biases versus the neutral condition they can be pushed to the annuity choice or pushed to the investment choice
3717221 whereas with women its only the investment bias that influences them we have to test and do other studies to find out why that is
3717222 in two thirds of the cases there was a bias
3717223 id like to know how many participants were able to pick up on that bias
3717224 the things that are unique to our school made it possible

3717226 clearly economists have something to learn from other fields and vice versa
3717227 the board and its constituent agencies are absolutely committed to learning from this tragic case and if one clear message emerges it must be always put the child first
3717228 in this case for example an officer had some years ago logged concerns about the state of the property in which oxtoby and scott lived
3717229 but as this was not a criminal matter no further action was taken to alert other agencies that they that they should perhaps look more closely at the circumstances

3717481 despite concerns on the deals valuation timing and strategic fit
3717482 the families who lost their near and dear ones in the unfortunate incidents
3717483 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3717484 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3717485 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3717486 ive got friends here who have just been lifelong friends people who have seen me through thick and thin in tough times and in good times
3717487 these additional voters guarantee virginia will be closer than its been before but closing that entire gap in one election is tough to do
3717488 buyers are returning to the market as the usda report removed uncertainty over flood related crop damage and some investors are betting recent retreats are overdone
3717489 we cannot find anyone how they were evacuated and what happened there is a mystery to us
3717490 georgian forces have begun their pullback toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3717491 russian occupying forces are continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3717492 if saakashvili had not been armed up to the teeth he would never have made such a decision
3717493 georgia should not have intervened in south ossetian capital tskhinvali in such an ill prepared manner this was a grave mistake
3717494 the situation is extremely tense and very complicated what happens next is uncertain i hope that the talks of president saakashvili with his western partners will lead to an end to the conflict
3717495 got scared and he ran over here he was bleeding
3717496 i kept telling him you dont want to do this
3717497 after we took a big lead we did not play well
3717498 this is the most seriously prepared game we ever had
3717499 and if we can keep doing well on rebounding like today we can win in upcoming matches
3717500 but we should beat them we have a lot more talent
3717501 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3717502 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3717503 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3717504 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3717505 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3717506 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute

3717508 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability
3717509 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity

3717511 he is just another person but maybe from a different planet
3717512 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3717513 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3717514 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3717515 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3717516 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3717517 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3717518 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3717519 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3717520 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3717521 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3717522 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this

3717527 the study has a very pro exercise message if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3717528 at that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom
3717529 at midnight the cry rang out heres the bridegroom come out to meet him
3717530 then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps the foolish ones said to the wise give us some of your oil our lamps are going out
3717531 no they replied there may not be enough for both us and you instead go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves
3717532 but while they were on their way to buy the oil the bridegroom arrived the virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet and the door was shut
3717533 later the others also came sir sir they said open the door for us
3717534 but he replied i tell you the truth i dont know you
3717535 therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour
3717536 a time when to be different was to be damned

3717547 the satmar hasidim represent 3 000 to 4 000 votes in a democratic primary
3717548 the kind of enthusiasm that i have seen from the younger generation to get out the vote has not been seen in the last 20 years
3717549 candidates and elected officials will be surprised at the number of voters come election time

3717590 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3717591 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3717592 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3717593 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3717594 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3717595 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3717596 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
3717597 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3717598 she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
3717599 we said be smart about this dont go in and dont fall for the russian provocation do not do this

3717604 in some ways its such a nice change to the regular tour we play in first of all being part of the biggest sports event in the world now that tennis is finally accepted by the olympic committee its something i wish to sort of move it forward in a way

3717621 les russes font partie de ce conflit ils ne sont pas une force de maintien de la paix
3717622 pour que ce soit une paix accept e par tous il faudrait que ce soit plus quilibr

3717634 this is not some quarrel in a far away land
3717635 history has shown that if you leave aggression to go unchecked greater crises will only emerge in the future
3717636 stability in the caucasus is a matter for the security of britain and our allies
3717637 we should accelerate the path to nato membership for countries such as georgia and other democracies such as ukraine if that is what they wish
3717638 the lack of clarity about georgias prospects of joining nato contributed to the present crisis
3717639 it encouraged russia because the west was divided and uncertain
3717640 the knowledge that nato membership was a real prospect would have provided allies with greater leverage over the actions of tbilisis government
3717641 of course france holds the eu presidency but that is not a reason for britain to sub contract our entire response to the crisis to our allies
3717642 we could be pressing for the negotiation of the strategic partnership between the eu and russia to be suspended
3717643 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3717644 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3717645 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3717646 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3717647 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3717648 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3717649 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3717650 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3717651 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3717652 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3717653 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3717654 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3717655 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3717656 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3717677 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos

3717680 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3717681 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico

3717683 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3717684 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3717696 according to galbraith this under mobilization was due to a mixture of overconfidence and incompetence surrounded by a chronic lack of political will as a result the german home front was never asked to make the kinds of sacrifice that were taken for granted by its opponents

3717711 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3717712 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3717713 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3717715 obviously now there is much tighter engineering opportunity to be much closer aligned with saps applications
3717716 we have to be realistic its one company so the openness has its limits
3717717 its easier to sell business objects to sap than to sell sap to business objects
3717718 the good news is at least for the first half of the year we are seen as an open and agnostic solution set
3717719 we feel we may have lost customers in the past because we may not have had the right solution weve got the right solution today
3717720 setting up a sharia financial company has been a great pleasure for us although we have taken a david and goliath approach

3717727 at present the way in which cells make these sugars is not well understood from the little we do know we believe isolated fragments of these sugars could be used to instruct cells to behave in particular ways
3717728 we also think we might be able to force cells to make one particular type of sugar and not another thereby influencing the way in which that cell grows and interacts with other cells

3717741 am horizont zeichnet sich bereits ab dass die informationslawine allm hlich geb ndigt und strukturiert werden wird zu sinnvollen verl sslichen und auf die person ma geschneiderte wissenseinheiten das wird geschehen ber die st rkere verwendung von metadaten von intelligenten agenten von vertikalen suchmaschinen wo fachleute informationen gefiltert und kombiniert haben von gigaportalen f r die verschiedensten anwendungsbereiche von aktiven dokumenten die von sich aus antworten geben k nnen

3717745 una cosa es que tengamos derechos y otra es que se cumplan y esta sentencia ayudar a velar por los derechos de los trabajadores tanto en el plano laboral como en el personal como ha sido mi caso porque yo laboralmente no ten a problemas
3717746 es evidente que una empresa propiedad de la conferencia episcopal no es demasiado proclive ni al ascenso de las mujeres ni al reconocimiento de los derechos que tengan que ver con el mundo homosexual eso no cabe discutirlo
3717747 era un referente social para la clase trabajadora defensora de los derechos de las personas
3717748 fuimos un referente social insisti incluso desde una ptica cristiana que yo puedo respetar y respeto profundamente si la ptica cristiana no tiene nada que ver con los desprop sitos y barbaridades cometidos posteriormente
3717749 esa l nea ideol gica de defensa de los derechos de las personas y de los trabajadores en los a os 80 fue derivando poco a poco en un giro pol tico hacia la derecha m s radical tabernaria y espantosa que se pod a imaginar por lo que estoy doblemente contenta de no tener que regresar
3717750 obviamente s porque si las empresas no tuviesen la seguridad de que van a salir impunes en estos asuntos no pasar an a nadie se le ocurre agreg despedir a nadie porque es miope o moreno o bajito porque son circunstancias que nadie puede variar y es exactamente lo mismo en la orientaci n sexual porque no es una opci n a pesar de lo que se dice uno es lo que es
3717751 la empresa no puede decir ah es que usted es no s qu no mire yo ya lo era antes pero es que adem s eso no tiene nada que ver con mi trabajo
3717752 est claro que esto se puede hacer con bastante impunidad como hasta hace poco se pod a despedir sin problema alguno a una se ora por quedar embarazada porque a las empresas les resulta m s barato pagar un despido o una multa que respetar nuestros derechos
3717753 ahora tengo dos a os para replantearme mi vida pues est claro que con 45 a os es bastante complicado encontrar trabajo en el sector de la comunicaci n que est tan precarizado en mi caso usaron un becario para deshacerse de m y yo no voy a ser la becaria de nadie

3717757 when i flipped at the 50 and saw how far ahead he was knowing he was the world record holder for a split second a thought crossed my mind there is no way
3717758 but i said you know what this is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a super charge and just took it from there it was unreal
3717759 you are an insightful and engaging presenter and your program far exceeded my expectations

3717766 basically the kind of research that we do at plum island its the only facility like it
3717767 the proposed national bio and agro defense facility would expand upon and move into the 21st century our research currently conducted at plum island
3717768 well incorporate the comments we receive during the comment period finalize the environmental impact statement and anticipate a final decision on how best to proceed by the end of this year
3717769 were also looking at a number of other things like cost of construction and site characterization
3717770 i dont know enough yet to make that decision and that is my concern
3717771 this has been on the table for years and no one seems to know about this and were supposed to be submitting input from our communities
3717772 we dont anticipate the new facility would be operational until fiscal year 2015 so we are making investments in the plum island property so that it does meet our needs in the near term
3717773 but we undertook this process with the understanding that it would not meet our research needs into the future

3717777 but i think were just forgetting how long a solar minimum can last
3717778 we have already observed a few sunspots from the next solar cycle
3717779 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3717780 this is china turning on its hospitality and welcoming people and it isnt just journalists getting the red carpet treatment
3717781 on the substantive issues there hasnt been much movement at all
3717782 the one human rights pledge that china made was that there would be a free media for the games and that just hasnt materialized
3717783 i can give you a general principle that is the chinese government adopts a positive and open attitude and welcomes foreign journalists coming to china and report on the beijing olympics
3717784 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for

3717787 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3717788 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3717789 we have issued advertisements inviting applications to the post of coordinator people living with hiv aids plha only from candidates who are hiv positive earlier we had set this as a desirable factor but then we decided to make it an essential one
3717790 there were no licensing requirements in pennsylvania for mortgage referral agencies so people could run around and do whatever they want
3717791 this will cause mortgage referral agents to think twice before encouraging people to accept a predatory loan
3717792 this is unfortunately one of the most insane obscene and disgusting things ive heard in all my public life

3717804 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3717805 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3717806 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3717807 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3717808 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
3717809 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3717810 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3717811 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3717812 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3717813 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
3717814 i respect him and the campaign that he has run but theres going to come a time when were going to have to get into specifics i have not observed every speech he has given obviously but they are singularly lacking in specifics and thats when as the campaign moves forward we will be portraying very stark differences its not an accident that he has i think according to the national journal the most liberal voting record in the united states senate i have one of the most conservative
3717815 to encourage a country with only rhetoric rather than sound and proven ideas that trust in the strength and courage of free people is not a promise of hope it is a platitude
3717816 of course i would like for him to withdraw today
3717817 it would be much easier but i respect and have repeatedly said i respect his right to continue in this race just as long as he wants to
3717818 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3717819 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3717820 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3717821 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3717822 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3717823 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3717824 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3717825 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3717826 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3717827 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3717828 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3717829 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well

3717836 the sight of russian tanks rolling into part of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill to the spine of many people rightly because that is a reversion to its not just cold war politics its a 19th century way of doing politics
3717837 on the security and stability of the area consistent with the territorial integrity of georgia
3717838 countries need to know that their territorial integrity is secure
3717839 the russians want to assert this concept i think of ex soviet space somehow denying that these are independent countries with territorial integrity of their own i think that is unacceptable
3717840 russia knows that its strength in the 21st century is going to have to be asserted economically and not just militarily but we have got to make sure that this remains absolutely clear
3717841 its not in russias interests to continue to hanker for a soviet past because frankly its gone and its good that its gone
3717842 we are quite disappointed with what we see as a somewhat biased coverage of the events in south ossetia by western media
3717843 we know oxidants produce free radicals that damage cells our experiments show ruthenium produces a reaction in the cell which destroys its anti oxidant defence glutathione thus destroying the cancer infected cell
3717844 working with colleagues in edinburgh university and oncosense weve proved this could be an effective line of defence against cancer
3717845 die f r die lebensqualit t der frau in vielerlei hinsicht sehr wichtigen inneren organe zu erhalten ist eines der wichtigsten ziele unserer operativen t tigkeit
3717846 mehr als die h lfte auch kleinerer eingriffe erfolgt ber den gro en bauchschnitt
3717847 obwohl das f r die patientinnen belastend und nicht erforderlich ist
3717848 unser angebot richtet sich insbesondere an frauen mit unterleibsschmerzen oder blutungsst rungen
3717849 denn vor allem bei frauen kurz vor oder in den wechseljahren f hren diese blutungsst rungen oft zu einer geb rmutterentfernung
3717850 selbst wenn die entfernung der geb rmutter unumg nglich ist gibt es heute schonende verfahren bei denen wir ohne narben auskommen und den beckenboden nicht in mitleidenschaft ziehen
3717851 damit k nnen wir unsere patientinnen so organschonend wie m glich und gleichzeitig mit der gr tm glichen heilungschance behandeln
3717852 bei der sogenannten goldnetzmethode wird ein spezielles netz aus goldf den von unten in die geb rmutter eingelegt
3717853 die feinen netzstrukturen passen sich perfekt dem gewebe an und k nnen auch stellen erreichen die f r unsere sonstigen instrumente nicht zug nglich sind
3717854 der vorteil bei 98 prozent der damit behandelten frauen k nnen wir so die blutungsst rungen stoppen ohne die geb rmutter entfernen zu m ssen
3717855 wir m chten dieses verfahren dennoch den frauen die eine alternative zum verlust der geb rmutter suchen in unserer sprechstunde anbieten
3717856 beide methoden haben das potential die zukunft der kinderwunschbehandlung entscheidend zu pr gen
3717857 die methode soll allerdings zuerst bei frauen mit kinderwunsch und krebserkrankung zum einsatz kommen da eine chemotherapie h ufig die eierst cke irreversibel sch digt sollte eine gefrierlagerung von eierstockgewebe noch vor der chemotherapie angestrebt werden
3717858 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3717859 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3717860 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3717861 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3717862 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3717863 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3717864 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3717865 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3717866 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
3717867 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict

3717869 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
3717870 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3717871 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3717872 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3717873 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3717874 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3717875 the dana farber staff and i are anxious to do whatever we can to support the family at this time as well as the staff here who cared for them
3717876 they were the nicest people youd ever want to know
3717877 the building shook really good i said somebody needs to call 911 because that was the plane
3717878 it was just a big ball of fire and big black smoke
3717879 the heat was so intense you just couldnt get close to it
3717880 people were running out and just watching there wasnt anything anybody could do
3717881 it was really intense flames it was just too fast
3717882 i was with a customer and i just saw a blur i didnt know what it was and then there was an explosion a fireball
3717883 i stumbled back shaking a little and said my god did you just see that we stood there for a couple seconds in awe its a tragedy but we are just so fortunate that no one else was hurt
3717884 a couple of seconds after that i saw big flames
3717885 we both saw flames and there was black smoke everywhere

3717897 i started watersisweb because i had the knowledge of water resources and i thought this is the best one to start with
3717898 we can bring the professionals and users in this field from all over the world together
3717899 the difference between a blog and a bookmarking site is that a blog has a moderator to decide what is good and what is not here the users control the content if they are interested in something they post it there but because the taste of one person may be completely different from the taste of the entire community other users are given a chance to vote
3717900 there are a lot of tags but because everyone assigns their own tags the classification is often inconsistent thats the downside of having the users control the site
3717901 lots of gee i didnt know that there are some things i never would have found on my own
3717902 this site is important because it provides information on water related topics that no other type of site can
3717903 it allows anybody who is interested to post water related items that they find interesting so it works really well as a forum for current news and science
3717904 future siswebs coming after watersisweb might be dedicated to electrical engineering dentistry transportation and climate change

3717935 now more than ever the technology infrastructure used by industry and government must be as mobile and flexible as the people who use it

3717937 the juniper solution can be easily managed through a single interface without compromising performance or reliability
3717938 the isg 2000 is essentially the gatekeeper for multiple network segments and the idp feature further boosts network security
3717939 electronic network security and reliability are as essential to chinas sustained growth as the physical infrastructure of the countrys railway system
3717940 organizations such as the ministry of railways are recognizing the high performance reliability of our security solutions and we are pleased that junipers solutions are helping to ensure the smooth operation of mission critical systems across china

3717945 shell cant hide the environmental impact of their oil sand projects
3717946 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
3717947 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
3717948 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
3717949 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3717950 oil sands are an incredibly destructive source of energy and along with the expansion of shells oil refining capacity in texas cannot be considered a sustainable way to meet the worlds future energy needs
3717951 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power
3717952 the cea cnet indexes provide market observers a new metric on the economy and the first of its kind metric to gauge the on going health of the consumer technology sector
3717953 by eliciting subjective probabilities the indexes are better at capturing consumers attitudes and feelings about the economy
3717954 results from the cea cnet indexes are consistent with what we are seeing elsewhere spending on consumer technologies remains a priority for consumers despite the overhanging economic uncertainty
3717955 consumer electronics have become an indispensible part of peoples lives and a major factor in the health of the u s economy
3717956 were thrilled to be partnering with cea to bring these indexes to the industry for the first time we have a tool that allows economists and business leaders to track a sector that is expected to exceed 173 billion in u s factory sales this year
3717957 in high pressure banking environments communications networks must empower employees with fast cost effective and secure communications capabilities that help them deliver superior customer service
3717958 nortels unified communications solution has lowered our network management costs while improving customer service by empowering employees to collaborate more efficiently and effectively than ever
3717959 banks face unique challenges in connecting large numbers of small branch offices spread over a wide area
3717960 bank of panhsins unified communications investment has not only simplified its secure communications infrastructure but offers new opportunities to increase its competitiveness by improving employee efficiency and customer service
3717961 securing sea routes such as those off the horn of africa
3717962 the explanation for this peculiar situation lies in the political intricacies of germanys ruling coalition
3717963 si quer an un xito mundial los tengo todos aqu dentro
3717964 something remarkable is hppening people are seeing this as an unprecedented opportunity to really get themselves their organizations and their communities prepared
3717965 every day we hear from schools businesses and many others about what they are planning and how they are excited to be a part of the shakeout and to encourage others to participate
3717966 all this is coming together in a way that has never happened before
3717967 whats really rewarding as a scientist is to see how the scientific foundation provided by the shakeout scenario seems to be inspiring real preparedness actions throughout the region this is important because its what we do now before a big earthquake that will determine what our lives will be like after
3717968 early indications are that these criminals have been tampering with retailers chip and pin terminals in order to steal card transaction data and pins from these machines
3717969 to date compromised chip and pin terminals have been found in less than 30 retail outlets throughout the uk together with the banking and retail industries we are working to ensure this figure is minimised
3717970 in the unlikely event a cardholder is an innocent victim of this or any type of fraud they enjoy excellent protection under the banking code which means that they will not suffer any financial loss
3717971 now its not just cash machines its every card reader in every shop or restaurant
3717972 the pin access devices are being re engineered it seems like crooks have broken the encryption on the chip but this is unclear
3717973 our recently deployed networking products had quickly proven to be limited in performance slow to adapt and costly and complex to manage and we knew we needed to proactively simplify our network architecture to align our network to our rapidly evolving business requirements
3717974 we were also paying significantly for a service contract on the network equipment and we werent realizing the level of service or return on investment we had been promised juniper came in with a technology and service strategy that made us more efficient more profitable and better equipped to deliver the superior level of customer service that sets us apart in todays fiercely competitive print on demand market
3717975 deploying junipers ex series switches and ssg firewalls has helped us to achieve and surpass our operational and financial objectives
3717976 we have increased network performance simplified operations and lowered our operational expenses so significantly that we had enough budget left over to purchase two of everything ensuring full redundancy of our network infrastructure were realizing an annualized savings of 90 000 usd in it costs weve reduced our data center footprint and weve achieved additional power consumption savings now we spend less on building managing and maintaining the network and more on strategic revenue generating activities
3717977 junos software gave us the simplicity and manageability we needed
3717978 because junos softwares feature set is consistent across juniper high performance network infrastructure we know that if we do something once with junos we can replicate it 2 000 times without the burden of learn something new for each product junos software makes it much easier to manage our juniper network infrastructure now we feel like were in control of our network rather than the other way around
3717979 amazingmail com offers a prime example of a high performance business that views the network as critical to its success but was straddled with spending too much time and money on keeping their network up and running
3717980 with our new ex series ethernet switches and ssg firewalls amazingmail com has successfully lowered cost complexity and risk and can now afford to invest more time and resources on innovation that will enhance customer loyalty and workforce productivity and more effectively support their revenue growth and profitability objectives and enable them to win the race
3717981 we have over 5 800 investments in europe and if we are given the opportunity we hope to investon road construction hospitals universities and a host of others in nigeria
3717982 our interest is to provideboth direct and indirect investments in the country
3717983 direct as in the area of road construction and otherphysical investments while the investment in educationwill improve the manpower need of the country
3717984 and at the end of the training jobs will be provided for them
3717985 our capacity building will entail both training abroad and building universities in the country to accommodate candidates who are physicallyimpaired
3717986 it is important to stress that we do not need any financial support from the government all we are asking is their support and approval
3717987 the federal government has established the one stopinvestment centre osic to enable it address issues of this nature
3717988 si quer an un xito mundial los tengo todos aqu dentro
3717989 this acquisition is another building block in nortels vision to be a software centric company and the leading provider of unified communications solutions
3717990 we believe that bringing pingtels critical r amp d capabilities in house will enable us to further develop software based solutions that go beyond the boundaries of our previous oem relationship we expect that this will enable nortel to accelerate the development of new it centric channels to market
3717991 pingtel has established itself as a unified communications vendor with market leading very sophisticated solutions based on interoperable software that can run on a multitude of hardware platforms
3717992 the acquisition of pingtel corp by nortel is the next logical step that will further accelerate adoption of the technology and solutions on a global basis we are very excited to become part of nortel the leading provider in the market for unified communications
3717993 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days i just wish today was a good day
3717994 were just as good as china we made mistakes they did not
3717995 a clear case of bad practice and an indicator of bad safety culture
3717996 reason for serious concern regarding the resistance of the reactor building of ol3
3717997 while nuclear power is inherently unsafe the unsound safety culture existing under the french contractor areva and its subcontractors threatens to significantly exacerbate the risks related to this nuclear power plant this is not a cookie factory building a nuclear installation demands the upmost caution neglect of safety standards can be disastrous

3718014 what has changed is that our financial situation is much worse
3718015 what we are asking is cant we at least take care of the children
3718016 we have every reason to believe that everyone who supported the levy in march will support the levy again
3718017 we still have every reason to believe this is where the community support is we understand the tough situation people are in but we are only asking for services for children

3718030 the only way we can generate the revenue needed to support air service or get our own service is a levy

3718033 i dont want to give the legislators any excuse to slow down our reforms
3718034 the more experienced guys tend to hang on until it gets better the new guys tend to get out there and slug it out
3718035 now the rivers almost getting too low you have to watch for logs and other hazards if you dont know the river
3718036 to save fuel most people just go up river cut back the speed cut the engine and drift all day
3718037 a lot of boats may tie together and just drift back to the mouth of the muskingum
3718038 its been ok a down year but youll have down years
3718039 in june and the first part of july the river was high and the weather miserable
3718040 gas prices never affect boating never you can have a down economy up economy high gas prices low gas prices never affects boating never has
3718041 we can see great boating easy through the middle of october
3718042 we had a terrible spring on the river and were just now seeing river traffic doing a bit better
3718043 gas prices had something to do with it but mostly it was weather were seeing better weather every weekend now and more boats stopping
3718044 boaters tell me they are paying close to 5 at parkersburg and over 5 everywhere else
3718045 no i dont think its been gas here thats the problem
3718046 some say gas prices slowed boating but i think it was more weather than gas
3718047 the river was high early in the summer but the slowdown was mostly from gas prices i think
3718048 i was a little leery with the price of gas but we went ahead and put a lot of money in the docks with new wood and railings
3718049 the gas prices have not seemed to hurt us at all
3718050 weve seen a dip this summer but id say its mostly been from the smoking ban
3718051 the river is looking good now we had a lot of business last weekend

3718065 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3718066 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
3718067 ive spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show then i have with senator obama
3718068 its not easy to make the infamous willie horton ad from the 1988 presidential campaign seem benign but suggesting that barack obama is the antichrist might just do it
3718069 the ad was the creation of fred davis one of mccains top media gurus as well as a close friend of former christian coalition head ralph reed and the nephew of conservative oklahoma senator james inhofe
3718070 a new time poll finds that the most conservative evangelicals are the least enthusiastic about mccains candidacy convincing them that obama does have two horns and a tail might be the best way of getting them to vote
3718071 oh a poor little homeless man life must be hard when all you have are cigarettes and donuts

3718098 there are still three training sessions before the super cup and in them we must improve on some aspects in which we failed today
3718099 i am very happy with my games for madrid things are turning out well and already i feel very integrated in the team
3718100 the game leaves us with good feelings but the result is not the best because madrid always wants to win but we must learn from the errors we have committed and against valencia we must win and score more goals
3718101 i know that racing santander blackburn and arsenal are interested
3718102 i have not heard anything about the united interest myself i let my agent manage this
3718103 united was my favourite club as a child if i get the chance it would be a dream for me i cross my fingers that something will happen in the next days
3718104 there has not been anything concrete but i do not rule out that something is going on now
3718105 we will in principle not refuse to play annan in the game

3718109 ensure that there is a calculation and analysis of the need to provide flexible fossil fuelled back up capacity for the increased level of intermittent renewable e g marine and wind generation estimates suggest that this back up capability could amount to over 90 per cent of this intermittent capacity itself overall then that could require an increase in the uks installed generating capacity from todays 76gw to more than 120gw by 2020

3718120 we are hugely disappointed to go out of the cup at this stage yet again we shot ourselves in the foot by creating chances and not taking them we need to remedy that very quickly because we had the same problem on saturday where we were creating chances but not scoring
3718121 that puts huge pressure on the defence to keep a clean sheet our keeper david marshall has not had a save to make in these two games apart from pick the ball out of the net three times defensively i think the boys have performed very well its just the boys at the top of the field who are not taking the chances
3718122 it was nice to get a strike it was just a little unlucky that it wasnt the right side of the post and it probably would have got us back into the game

3718130 for me this topic is no longer up for discussion
3718131 its continually been the case that one club or the other was in for me but nothing came of it in the end im not paying attention to this nonsense anymore im staying at bayern
3718132 the club now offers me the structures that i have always wanted i want to be here when bayern grows at the moment it looks like there will be a contract extension beyond 2010
3718133 the role of captain for me is not the deciding thing for me what is important is what happens on the pitch
3718134 i dont have to talk a lot what makes me stand out is my body language in the game i am a fighter oliver kahn wasnt the biggest talker but was a great captain im just like him
3718135 i dont believe thierry henry will come back to england that is my gut feeling
3718136 but i think if he comes back to england then he comes back to arsenal
3718137 moms tend to prefer brick and mortar stores because they want their kids to try on clothes and pick out items they like
3718138 im very excited about the opportunity to actually play on a first place team in august
3718139 we obviously dont have a lot of pop in the lineup
3718140 to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and you get a phone call today saying youre being traded to a first place team as a player thats all you could ask for
3718141 i dont have the words to describe it you play the game to put yourself to in position to be in the playoffs and be in a pennant race now im fortunate enough to have this opportunity
3718142 i was excited to get a chance to play for something meaningful in august and september it also meant leaving a place where i met a lot of great people and fans it was difficult
3718143 so id take some grounders and then head to left
3718144 id walk through hell in a gasoline suit to play baseball
3718145 thank goodness for that it is sheer relief because it has been a long time since we won
3718146 we are not getting carried away it is only one game but i cannot underestimate the importance of it i dont think there is any doubt we were the better team but at 1 0 we were looking down the barrel the shackles just lifted once we scored and all of a sudden there was a spring in our step we showed character to come back
3718147 our fitness levels were terrific and the crowd was great they stuck by us at one down and were a big help
3718148 the duke can drive you mad he has you pulling your hair out at times if youve got any the next minute he can have you jumping out of your seat thats what makes him so unpredictable
3718149 i know him really well i had him at wigan and he has all the attributes there is always the chance of him doing something out of the ordinary
3718150 i was reading something the other day about alan kulwicki when he won his championship in 1992
3718151 he wrecked out at dover with six races to go and he was about 280 points behind and came back to win the championship so being only 128 behind clint is not the end of the world
3718152 we need to race to win and if we can win some races we can close that gap really quickly
3718153 ive dragged my family halfway around the world and today it just feels like it was all worthwhile
3718154 teams have been dealing with left and right turns now they come to a big wide speedway
3718155 teams will work hard to keep the attitude of the car in what they feel is their perfect configuration to make them go as fast as they can on the long straights yet they need to give the driver as much feel and control as possible to make that left turn at 180 plus mph
3718156 theyve spent a lot of time and detail into hanging car bodies aerodynamics will play a big role at michigan
3718157 this war is something that has to be done either over there or here
3718158 im proud to serve my country like those before me for the cause of freedom
3718159 america is proud to have citizens like derek and brad that we call neighbors and friends and defenders of the peace

3718162 i really like that race track its a lot of fun to race on
3718163 we are sort of starting to swing back toward the tracks that we have better runs at and we have better luck at ive had some rough rough runs this summer but that seems to be the case every year these cars are pretty challenging this year but that is still a fun track for me
3718164 it is very special to drive for the wood brothers
3718165 they are historically one of the most famous teams i remember them growing up i read a lot about them with their race wins here in nascar theyve had a tough year and they need some momentum to move them forward and i hope i can help them do that
3718166 the very first time i saw the racetrack and was on it in the nascar craftsman truck series i adapted to the track very well loved the race track the way it raced i raced twice there in the trucks was undefeated and then came back and got two more wins in the nascar sprint cup series that racetrack has just been one of my favorites right out of the get go
3718167 michigan is a great track for us a two mile track with a lot of opportunity to race wheel to wheel to race clean to be able to pass clean and the guys have been very effective im just proud to ride the wave
3718168 when the caution comes out well sometimes reflect on where people are running i wont call in and ask i know the cars im racing for that position ill see them ten spots ahead of me and know that theres nothing i can do about it but certainly im aware where theyre at and running once the green flag drops youre really focused on the task at hand and thats getting the car around the track
3718169 if none of the manufacturers were involved at the level they all are then it wouldnt matter
3718170 were in the top 35 and thats been our big deal and i know once we get in were not going to fall back out
3718171 when we get to michigan ill be a lot happier when we dont have to qualify on time
3718172 its one of the tracks that really suits my style of driving the track is big and wide and there is plenty of room to pass if you get your car hooked up just right at michigan a driver can have a lot of fun there on the other hand if you arent very good it can make for a long day ive had my share of success there over the years and i would say it is one of my favorite tracks on the circuit
3718173 you laugh because im different i laugh cause i just farted
3718174 you laugh because im different i laugh because peppers with butterflies never swim on a sunday car wash
3718175 you laugh because of green 7s i laugh because that one time that dog danced with a tea cup spanish toads and oreo sponges with gem stones and smiles
3718176 i think all supermodels now are losing out to celebrities its celebrities getting all the cosmetics contracts

3718184 certainly not every abortion leads to domestic violence nor is every case of domestic violence rooted in the trauma of a prior abortion but it is not a coincidence that the rates of abortion and domestic violence have risen together during the last twenty five years the evidence supporting a correlation between abortion and violence between women and men at least for some couples is so compelling that it is beyond dispute
3718185 perhaps the two key elements related to post abortion violence are 1 increased levels of irritability anger and rage and 2 increased tendencies toward risk taking self destructive and suicidal behaviors
3718186 self hatred hatred of the male and hatred of men in general were all significantly correlated to each other
3718187 this constellation of problems an increased tendency toward violence emotional detachment and self destructive behaviors would appear to be exasperated by the study groups dramatically increased rate of drug and alcohol abuse subsequent to abortion
3718188 cycles of violence such as this are common studies of domestic abuse have found that women are substantially more likely to initiate violence then men as confirmed even by the women studied because of their greater strength however the hitting done by men causes more damage but researchers have also found that to offset this advantage of strength women are more likely to resort to the use of household weapons such as boiling water or knives
3718189 i dont know what happened i thought my feet were under me and next thing i know i was on my back
3718190 that it was going to lead to a lot of injuries
3718191 you have to do a bigger variety of difficult skills now
3718192 in our era you could do one or two difficult moves then fill out the rest of your routine with things you are comfortable doing now you have to be a freak of nature to be able to do a world class routine
3718193 everybody knows how rock solid chellsie is and definitely on floor also she had a chance to perform because we all remember what kind of routine she did at the trials
3718194 we throw some of the hardest skills on the floor
3718195 we are built of the strongest legs in the world and we love to fly we love to tumble really hard honestly we do have a problem stepping out of bounds
3718196 i have no proof so i cannot say they are underage
3718197 if that is true which it possibly could be because one of the little girls has a missing tooth then it is totally unfair because it doesnt give an even playing field for people all over the world
3718198 according to our investigations more than one person committed the crime they were all thought to be males who used guns and were armed at the time of the crime according to eyewitnesses a knife was also possibly used

3718218 many of us in the technology community have done a poor job of communicating to the general public why they should care about these issues with geekpac we hope to change that by driving thought leadership in this area and building a critical mass of concerned citizens who will be able to get the attention of their local politicians

3718226 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3718227 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
3718228 in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments
3718229 the us patent and trademark office may have a major problem on its hands the possibly unconstitutional appointment of nearly two thirds of its patent appeals judges such a constitutional flaw if legitimate could call into question the hundreds of decisions worth billions of dollars in the past eight years the flaw discovered by highly regarded intellectual property scholar john duffy of george washington university law school could also afflict the appointment of nearly half of the agencys trademark appeals judges

3718235 this is part of being at a big club the pressure of expectation is always high its a big game for us because the target is very high to be in the champions league said wenger
3718236 you always know when you come to holland you will get a good game and a tough one no matter who you play we know as well that demands a lot of respect and concentration to do as well as we can
3718237 if you are a good footballer you are a good footballer whether it is in the champions league or any other game
3718238 if you play against your friends on the beach or in a big game its exactly the same
3718239 in england we have to calm things down because after one month of games there is always media pressure to make quick stars wenger added
3718240 players are young but patient development does not mean you cannot start young but it is most important to keep developing as a player and that you dont have to worry about having too much pressure on your shoulders
3718241 i think it was a good move he maybe needed to get a change from england to position yourself as an international coach is always a very good move for the rest of your career said wenger
3718242 it was a little bit similar to what sir bobby robson did when he moved out of the england job
3718243 i dont think united have another level to go to they have a lot of players who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years said terry
3718244 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think you will see that again wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3718245 i think we can close the gap because manchester united were on top of their game last season but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3718246 there have been a lot of rumours flying about but i am not going anywhere there is a job for me to do here and i am looking forward to it there has been speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i arrived

3718248 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3718249 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3718250 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3718251 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3718252 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3718253 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3718254 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest

3718256 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3718257 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3718258 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3718259 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3718260 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose

3718289 director siddharth anand is a very talented director hes a lot of fun on the sets too he knows how each character has to behave when he first told me about the character of radhika i knew that was the role i would fit we had so much fun on the sets that we didnt even realise when the shooting got over overall it was a great experience
3718290 but at the same time love is her priority shes a generous and loving person i can definitely identify with radhika love is my priority and hers too but were both ambitious
3718291 his lines were impeccable his expressions great and his scenes were perfect he was so quiet for the first couple of days but when he opened up he would ask so many questions i think we both were a little hesitant in the beginning to get too chatty but later we got along very well
3718292 ranbir was very nice he kept trying to distract me and did all sort of comic things to make me smile but all i wanted was to get my root canal done
3718293 some of the shooting was in a villa which was supposed to be my house in the film my room had a gorgeous view but it was cold and i was wearing a short dress for the shooting and freezing there while everyone was fully covered i felt like an icicle but i had to look nice it was hard to shoot in that weather but it was fun

3718321 its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them gm crops out of hand
3718322 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout ing off about something which he has clearly got wrong
3718323 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present

3718359 while we expect the spend this year to eventually bear fruit we believe there will be significant pressure on margins kim wrote
3718360 this is unlike most of its competition which is cutting expenses but is the result of years of under investing in the business
3718361 while the company is slowly becoming a more focused retailer making the right investments in the business we believe that the spending associated with its strategy plan may pose pressure to earnings per share growth in 2008 and the first half of 2009
3718362 this is the first time since the sars issues in 2003 that china airline traffic data has turned negative
3718363 while legitimate concerns over weakening fundamentals in the slowing china travel market have weighed on shares since ctrip gave soft second quarter revenue guidance in mid may we believe the risk reward going into the second quarter has improved considerably as street expectations have come down materially in the past three weeks

3718377 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3718378 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease
3718379 manipulating this microrna provides a completely new way of addressing cardiovascular disorders
3718380 microrna research represents a new frontier in understanding and treating human disease this is just a hint of what can come

3718382 rna based drugs might provide a course of treatment for people whose cholesterol levels are resistant to current drugs or they might be combined with current drugs
3718383 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labor market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
3718384 the growing equality between genders reflects the entry of the most able women to the workforce rather than better pay while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago

3718395 ive never been involved in a game like that before as a pro going wire to wire with no penalties or turnovers
3718396 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3718397 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3718398 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run
3718399 everyone in this room already knows how good michael bennett is
3718400 hes fast hes strong and hes got good vision fundamentally this was a very good game for us no penalties or turnovers thats what you want we didnt do the little things that get you beat in this league
3718401 we got into a good rhythm and when other guys came in they did a great job too
3718402 we had a good running game going tonight were going to watch the film today and there will be a lot to build on i thought we looked pretty good out there
3718403 it feels good to say i played my first game as a pro
3718404 just like i expected the speed of the game in the nfl is a lot faster
3718405 you really wont know until you sit down and watch the tape but id say it was ok
3718406 its only one game but our line has taken an extra step
3718407 we kept converting on short yardage tonight and we did it convincingly where you dont even have to bring out the sticks to measure
3718408 they were all young last year and they kind of got thrown into the fire and did really well now theyre a year older and adding jeff faine at center really helps the offensive line should be one of the strong points of our team all season long
3718409 you cant make a steak out of a pigs ear
3718410 many of the question we ask god cant be answered directly not because god doesnt know the answers but because our questions dont make sense

3718423 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3718424 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3718425 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3718426 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3718427 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3718428 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3718429 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3718430 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3718431 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3718432 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3718433 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3718434 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3718464 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3718503 die wirklich harten bilder haben wir rausgeschnitten die w ren zu schockierend f r den zuschauer gewesen
3718504 jeden tag verschwinden von unserer erde immer mehr tierarten mich haben orang utans nicht losgelassen in einem tierpark in bangkok werden affen als gogo girls verkleidet oder als kickboxer abgerichtet und missbraucht das ist krank
3718505 ich habe dann 2006 aus eigener tasche mit meinem kameramann einen 15 min tigen teaser finanziert und in asien gedreht
3718506 wir wussten nur dass aus dem team von willie smits drei leute auf dem tiermarkt in jakarta ermordet wurden
3718507 tierhandel ist ein milliardengesch ft das konkurriert in asien mit drogen und waffenhandel und die drahtzieher lassen sich nicht gerne filmen aber markus strobel mein kameramann hat unterarme wie ich oberschenkel der l sst sich nicht so schnell einsch chtern sonst k nnte man solche filme auch gar nicht machen
3718508 das sch ne ist doch dass es noch hoffnung gibt ich habe den film wegen willie smits gemacht der mann hat eine vision er pflanzt pro tag 1000 b ume in einem abgeholzten gebiet neu an ich habe zwei gepflanzt und war danach schwei gebadet
3718509 so ein orang utan baby ist schon knuddelig aber gleichzeitig verbirgt sich hinter jedem baby eine trag die die m tter werden von den b umen geschossen fleisch und knochen nach china importiert weil man dort glaubt es mache potent die babys st rzen mit aus der h he eines von vier oder f nf berlebt diesen sturz und dann werden sie f r viel geld verkauft
3718510 wenn man einem orang utan in die augen schaut dann hat man nicht mehr das gef hl dass es sich um ein tier handelt 98 prozent der dna ist mit unserer identisch nur sind die orang utans so gutm tig zu gutm tig f r den menschen die wehren sich nicht trotz ihrer st rke

3718557 it will be seen that the great messiah who was the founder of the christian religion was a polygamist the messiah chose by marrying many honorable wives himself show to all future generations that he approbated the plurality of wives under the christian dispensation as well as under the dispensation in which his polygamist ancestors lived
3718558 we have now clearly shown that god the father had a plurality of wives one or more being in eternity by whom he begat our spirits as well as the spirit of jesus his first born and another being upon the earth by whom he begat the tabernacle of jesus as his only begotten in this world we have also proved most clearly that the son followed the example of his father and became the great bridegroom to whom kings daughters and many honorable wives were to be married we have also proved that both god the father and our lord jesus christ inherit their wives in eternity as well as in time and then it would be so shocking to the modesty of the very pious ladies of christendom to see abraham and his wives jacob and his wives jesus and his honorable wives all eating occasionally at the same table and visiting one another and conversing about their numerous children and their kingdoms oh ye delicate ladies of christendom how can you endure such a scene as this if you do not want your morals corrupted and your delicate ears shocked and your pious modesty put to the blush by the society of polygamists and their wives do not venture near the new earth for polygamists will be honored there and will be among the chief rulers in that kingdom

3718704 the warehousing of the basa fund domiciled with the central bank of nigeria
3718705 they were to appear on monday june 30 2008 but the attorney general of the federation had through a letter communicated to the committee that he traveled out of the country for an official assignment
3718706 since the attorney general and minister of finance were at different times not available
3718707 the accountant general of the federation is to transfer management of the basa fund to ncaa by effecting a change of signatories
3718708 this action of transfer of basa account to ncaa is consistent with section 75 of the civil aviation act 2006 the honourable minister of transportation and the honourable minister of finance are to facilitate the change and ensure that action is completed within one week from january 28 2008

3718710 we thought that if we wanted to run a university the way that it is supposed to be run we needed resources
3718711 but that signaled the resistance in the tertiary education sector to any form of contribution to the cost of training
3718712 the resources available to tertiary institutions by the government both at the federal and state levels were dwindling
3718713 it ranged from over n300 000 to almost n800 000 for veterinary medicine for medicine and pharmacy it was in the range of n680 000 we said nobody would ask anybody to pay the full cost let the government bear a percentage and let the beneficiary bear a percentage at no level is any student paying more than one third of the actual cost because for medicine its almost n700 000 we are charging n225 000 for humanities it is in the range of n500 000 we are charging n152 500 for indigenes and n162 500 for non indigenes as for science engineering and technology it is n182 000 and there are no hidden charges if we appear to have any financial stability its because we are able to raise resources from the government from our local government and from the beneficiary it has also put some value on the education that is being given
3718714 you have some parents coming forward to request that they be allowed to make part payment of the fees because they know the value of the education that their wards are being offered and we allow it
3718715 we have chosen the prototype of the university of london and that is why our respective colleges located in six towns offer different courses they are all autonomous campuses we are grateful to have a governor who has given us a lot of free hand to lay the basis for the development of the university our governing council is composed of mostly professors some of whom have been vice chancellors in reputable universities or people who have held important administrative positions relevant to the development of a university we also enjoy financial contribution from the local governments who give us 5 per cent of their allocation from the direct charge

3718718 when i came back about two days later oblivious of what happened i saw many people in what used to be my house no one cried but they wore forlorn faces only my wife was crying and she held me by the hand and asked me to follow her she led me to a corner of the compound and showed me the four graves where all my children were buried i never believed it and i went berserk suddenly people held me and took me away they held me indoors in my brothers place where i been living like a refugee for four months and people were coming to console me and give words of encouragement
3718719 i have lost every sense of work i dont even know what to do vehicle owners refused to employ in the belief that i have not got the mind to drive again that is how i took to subsistence farming i want people to help me i still want to marry and have children and have a roof over my head i cant do these things because i dont have the money
3718720 he was close to where the slide occurred and we ran away shouting and crying
3718721 at night we go to sleep with families in the neighbouring villages which are not yet affected some other people go to a nearby secondary school what we need now is assistance from governments from both state and federal levels and in fact to be relocated elsewhere
3718722 it is recalled that the major landslide at obunwe erosion site in enugwu nanka in the 80s rendered many families homeless and refugees not too long ago at amako village a man lost his four children to one single flood erosion it was a disaster two many
3718723 thus no family consciously allows water from their compounds to escape into the road
3718724 this scenario is also true of other areas where this control measure terminated abruptly had it continued perhaps our experience today may have been a smiling one
3718725 the erosion menace has attracted the attention of the former commonwealth secretary general chief emeka anyaoku yet nothing came out of it
3718726 if this is done governments state and federal must now develop a comprehensive erosion control master plan for agulu nanka oko ekwulobia erosion bed
3718727 it is more of flood control powered by modern technology only after this major thrust can any talk of trees and shrub planting be meaningful
3718728 it is strongly suggested that this project be re appraised with a view to continuing and completing it as quickly as possible to save lives and farm lands
3718729 it is important to note that the deluge of water from igboukwu and isuofia when it rains are major contributory factors to the reactivation of major earth movements in nanka oko and ekwulobia and must also address igboukwu isuofia flood zone
3718730 if you have 10 today tomorrow they will be 30 just like that and today i can tell you we have well over 1000 erosion sites in anambra state and of course about 500 of them are very active

3718734 gis gives you a very good visualization method to understand what is happening in real time
3718735 gis also provides tools to better analyze large volumes of complex data immediately following the earthquake we worked on a continuous basis with government agencies and others to offer assistance wherever we could we will continue to support the long term recovery the work being done with gis is helping to reduce the impact of this large complex disaster
3718736 people of the human sphere i am still alive last comic standing cannot kill me nothing can i fired a twinkie out of

3718788 not that im an expert on all these religions but what i know about all the other major religions kind of all just fall a little flat in their i guess just in their kind of narrowmindedness i feel like theres something much more basic than what all these people are worried about i find it really shocking that two groups that are from an outsiders perspective almost identical you know shiites and sunnis or catholics and protestants can actually kill each other over these minor details
3718789 well i guess its to me you know pretty much commonsense you can only really understand good if you have bad so the idea of heaven or anything that happens for eternity even if its nice i cant imagine it being nice forever even the idea of forever is kind of ridiculous which is unfortunate because its kind of a nice thing to say you know i think it softens the blow of mortality and having to say goodbye to everything you know and everyone you love and all that kind of thing i think its a nice concept and i wish it made sense to me but i guess it doesnt
3718790 i guess im just conflicted i mean i want to find something like that badly but in all the forms where its been offered to me they seem fraudulent

3718839 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

3718979 the effect of cblis compound on limb recovery in our animal model of tourniquet induced injury is encouraging and the efficacy with which it protects warrants continued investigation
3718980 these results will allow us to project the potential use of this compound for multiple applications beyond tourniquet injury from kidney and heart ischemia to reducing the rapid inflammation normally observed in transplanted organs exploring all situations with similar mechanisms of tissue injury
3718981 the fact that protectan cblb502 demonstrated results even after the removal of a tourniquet could make it particularly practical for battlefield conditions or other types of civilian emergency use since it can be applied after an injured subject is delivered to the site of treatment

3719015 the dec 2008 survey shows that federation technology adoption is growing at a strong clip having captured about 50 of the early market and the value it provides to enable access across partner organizations is driving that adoption in the marketplace
3719016 it is great to see such a positive reception for federation technology in the marketplace and we appreciate the education provided to the worlds largest users of windows technology by netpros directory experts conference
3719017 as the leading provider of technology for windows infrastructure management netpro strongly believes in research to understand the issues needs and best practices of the identity and access management community
3719018 the knowledge we have gained from this years dec survey enables us to build better products and we share it freely with the community to contribute to the productivity and effectiveness of its members
3719019 the results of the dec survey suggest that identity and access management is clearly on the radar of enterprise it practitioners
3719020 with that said growing numbers are looking to deploy or have deployed role based access control products to better manage access rights while managing user access rights across distributed resources and applications can certainly be a complex task it is a task required to enforce security and meet compliance requirements
3719021 there are many operational problem areas within the identity and access management community today from password management and compliance reporting to delegating administrative rights
3719022 not surprisingly getting better tools and automation tops dec survey respondents wish list for the second year in a row to help streamline these issues netpro offers accessmanager to help administrators meet security and compliance mandates and lower overall costs with centralized role based access management delegation and access reporting for windows resources

3719033 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3719034 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3719035 our organization rose to the challenge and delivered strong second quarter earnings and cash flow despite the poor economic environment
3719036 while we are never fully satisfied when sales are down we continued to outperform most of our major competitors in same store sales and to gain market share with a combination of differentiated merchandise current fashions and great value this will continue to be our emphasis as we enter the fall season

3719042 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3719043 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3719044 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3719045 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3719046 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3719047 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3719048 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3719054 the more we really believe the truths god calls us to believe the more we will take chances with god we can press through the pains of the famine and find comfort in knowing that god has a good plan even in our discomfort
3719055 something in us wants to believe that god could have great thrings in store for us too
3719056 when we are willing to embark on a life that requires faith we are more aware of god and his ability to provide for us in every detail of our lives
3719057 if we live our lies unaware of god in the small things were probably living unaware of his presence in the big things as well how vitally important it is for us to surrender our hearts to god and ask him daily to reveal his plans and perspectives to us so we dont miss his activity and his glorious plans for our future
3719058 these two psalms reveal some of the character qualities god looks for in his people those these qualities are not possible in our fleshly nature with god we can aspire to be righteous because he is at work within us
3719059 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3719060 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3719061 alright everyone we have a little problem after a shitload of releases its our first tour in north america and we cannot decide which songs to play live for you please help us to celebrate our first tour outside europe and the n release in north america we decided to let you people choose our setlist for the tour heres your chance to choose what songs will be heard live on our canadian tour 2008 vote by registering to this thread you may only pick one song so be careful what you wish for after the poll is complete we will practice the setlist you just voted for and those songs will be heard live on our canadian tour this fall youve got time until september 1st so be quick voting starts now note this tour is for n release in north america so we still might have to add a couple of new songs if it seems people prefer the older songs too much or we might have to edit the setlist if we see that we need to add remove some slower songs the amount of songs thatll be played on tour is from 12 to 16 depending on performing slot curfew set by the venue promoter

3719183 hey so i saw a news article about this product and found your blog through a google search my question
3719184 mestinya tvri bisa bersaing lebih baik dengan siapa saja karena tvri tidak pernah bicara tentang pengembalian modal biaya penyusutan sedangkan stasiun tv lainnya bicara itu semua jadi kalau tvri tidak baik berarti ada kesalahaan tiada yang lain jadi badan pengawas tvri mesti marah jika itu tidak baik terjadi
3719185 terus terang saja sebelum jadi wapres tvri selalu jadi alternatif terakhir kalau menonton televisi oleh sebab itu diharapkan dengan sistem digitalisasi ini tvri bisa lebih baik saya akan buktikan kalau saya pulang ke makassar apakah tvri sudah tidak seperti gerimis lagi
3719186 boleh saja tetap kritis akan tetapi dalam batasan dana dari pemerintah jadi berbeda dengan televisi swasta

3719197 when i was a young associate maybe my second or third year i made a list of people i thought someday would be successful and consequently need legal assistance in some way
3719198 my goal was to develop a relationship with each person so that when he or she needed a lawyer
3719199 i intentionally built relationships with my group of 40 i took them out to dinner or lunch and to sporting or cultural events depending on their interest sometimes i enlisted my wife or kids if i knew that they had something in common with my guests as i got to know these 40 better
3719200 over time the list grew from 40 to more than a hundred my notes on their interests family background and professional accomplishments grew too i found i had an uncanny ability to spot potential because many not all of my prospects developed into successful and wealthy business leaders government officials and referral sources many have become good friends along the way not to mention clients most of my clients today were either on my list of 40 were referred from them or came from people i met through that initial list

3719208 we desire to be professional and practice with great professional etiquette we understand we fall short of perfection sometimes that happens this is a physical and emotional game played by those kind of people but it doesnt necessarily make him a thug
3719209 hes very sensitive to it and guys are sensitive to it
3719210 his actions were referred to as thuggery we take offense to that
3719211 these are young professional people who are very good at what they do who are very sensitive to how they are portrayed in the public light i was offended by that reference hes not a thug hes a young professional football player who happens to play very physical
3719212 i never mugged anybody or robbed anybody i got a clean record i dont know how i would be classified as a thug
3719213 everyone knows what i can do i dont think i have to prove anything i just have to go out and have a good solid game coming off this injury

3719246 the aa has conducted numerous research projects into the effects of alcohol on driving and without exception each one has proven that drivers are already significantly impaired at the 0 05 percent limit we are concerned that this limit is inappropriate in south africa where one is 14 times more likely to die in a traffic crash than in the usa
3719247 the aa fully agrees with the 0 02 percent limit for professional drivers
3719248 this allows some leeway for medications which contain alcohol but still emphasises that one alcoholic drink puts you over the limit the mixed message of having a different limit for ordinary drivers is impeding the fight against drunkenness on our roads
3719249 the more risk factors we can eliminate from the roads the safer theyll become

3719572 the crisis was past just before midnight and it has continued to function and supply electricity to the gloucester area and beyond
3719573 water is still high around walham and there is a prospect of further peaks and the problem of retained water in the severn basin is going to give problems for several days to come
3719574 were doing everything we can to address that as a priority and we have two to three million litres of bottled water a day being delivered to cheltenham racecourse to be distributed by the military at 17 centres
3719575 we currently have 490 bowsers here and another 270 are on their way we will have 900 here by 6am tomorrow
3719576 we are not expecting rain later in the week to have much impact what we will see probably though is the rate of receding slowing up a little
3719577 our advice to people is to look out for flood warnings a lot of people have put in a lot of hours to deal with this situation and our thanks go to them all
3719578 bowser water or bottled water should also be used for tooth brushing or cooking or anything else where you might ingest it
3719579 sanitation is an important issue were looking at please avoid flushing where possible and remember you can use grey water such as from streams or rain or you can recycle water you have used for tooth brushing or cooking to flush
3719580 if people continue to show patience and forbearance and common sense and continue to conserve water supplies and listen to key message we will come through this successfully

3719585 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3719586 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3719587 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3719588 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3719601 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3719602 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3719603 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3719832 today the georgian ambassador to the netherlands filed a law suit to the international court of justice called the state of georgia against the state of russia because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia in 1993 to 2008
3719833 the ferocity in which the actions of the georgian side were carried out cannot be called anything else but genocide because they acquired a mass character and were directed against individuals the civilian population peacekeepers who carried out their functions of maintaining peace

3719882 in the past week the birds have destroyed more than 100 farms in eight villages
3719883 the federal government should as a matter of urgency mobilise resources to deal with the problem in borno because these birds are highly destructive and move with amazing speed
3719884 the uncontained destruction of crops by these birds in borno and other neighbouring states will create a food imbalance in the region this crop season because even if other states were to record bumper harvests the shortage in the northeast would put strain on the yield

3719949 in fact its not a new policy its what the tories said in the 1930s it reminds me of what my mother had to do daughter of a welsh mining family she had to work in service in the wealthy homes of the wirral when she wanted to stay with her family in north wales
3719950 the same policy was echoed later by norman tebbit in the thatcher regime when he said
3719951 this gave us the highest level of unemployment in the cities they talk about liverpool hull bradford etc and what was their answer then in liverpool it was for heseltine to take a bus load of bankers up to the city and establish what they called garden festivals go there now the garden festival has been demolished the city is rebuilt public services improved and a new confidence particularly as europes capital of culture
3719952 labours policy was to establish the regional development agencies and exciting regeneration programmes we worked with private and public companies local authorities and with massive public investment
3719953 if the mekons at this tory think tank had even bothered to go north of watford theyd discover that these very towns that they want to give up on have experienced a remarkable renaissance under labour
3719954 it would be easy to dismiss this as the work of a bunch of wonkers but its quite clear that policy exchange and the tory party are as one the think tanks last director was hired by boris johnson to be his head of policy and several policy exchange staffers now work at the very top of the conservatives party the tory party claims it wants greater social mobility but for the tories its not as we thought between classes what david cameron really means by social mobility is get on your bike head down south and take the nanny and servant jobs available in witney oxfordshire
3719955 if you agree with me 80 vote for me if you agree with me 100 see a psychiatrist
3719956 the tory leopard doesnt change its spots they still see people as economic units to be moved around not as people with families who want to live and work in the cities they were born in and since mr cameron is visiting liverpool today maybe hed like to explain this in more detail liverpool should tell him to get on his bike and go back to oxford

3719960 what were trying to do with our team is develop these mathematical models so that when theres a disease outbreak health officials have some idea how to answer what if questions
3719961 its very important for health officials because they need to figure out which groups they should target to stop the disease from spreading
3719962 once you understand how much interaction there is you can actually start predicting when you think the disease will get to other groups
3719963 we cannot just say were sitting here in canada we dont care about whats going on elsewhere outbreaks in one part of the world other parts of the world are vulnerable
3719964 it started in china and within a day or two we had cases in canada as well
3719965 if scientists work with people in china to try and understand whats going on maybe you could prevent outbreaks in other places like canada
