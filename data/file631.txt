6310000 we are concerned because the temperature in the area overnight have dropped to a fairly low degree
6310001 it wasnt destined to actually come back to australia it was going to be dispersed
6310002 but because the director here thought really australians should have an opportunity to see this we have brought it back
6310003 shes clearly a natural theres no doubt about that she didnt have to go to art school consult art books or have good or bad reviewers or anything like that
6310004 huge gestures bold intuitive shes a master of controlling the space and colour its all natural to her
6310005 if anyones got the slightest interest in art of any kind at all if they miss this opportunity they really are missing an opportunity
6310006 because there was over 120 australians who flew to tokyo for the opening to see emily there not knowing then that it was probably going to be here
6310007 the chances of seeing this comprehensive body of work again inside the next few decades certainly in my lifetime is quite remote
6310008 people always insist these girls are the best and they are going to win
6310009 but theyre not unbeatable of course its possible to win thats what make tonights competition interesting
6310010 im going to enjoy it whether im first or fifth whatever place i end up im going to enjoy the ride
6310011 wilkinson the oldest diver in the final has been bothered by chronically sore triceps that flare up on her entries
6310012 im used it im kind of old you know we have these aches and pains
6310013 but its holding up fine my last entry was great
6310014 while the veteran moved on 15 year old olympic rookie haley ishimatsu was eliminated the american was in the top 12 until the final round but under rotated her entry and landed with a huge splash on the same dive that wilkinson nailed to secure her spot in the final
6310015 but just to be diving here has been a great experience for me
6310016 it proves that even after such an illness you can win gold
6310017 leukaemia has taught me to think step by step just be patient lay in your bed and wait
6310018 thats almost the same strategy i chose here to stay in the pack stay easy stay patient and wait for my chance
6310019 it was the hardest thing ive ever done in my life

6310022 maarten is a worthy champion a tough competitor his story can inspire others what hes achieved is fantastic phenomenal
6310023 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public
6310024 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate
6310025 given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation
6310026 cricket australias acting chief executive michael brown said lee was granted short term leave causing him to miss the matches against bangladesh on aug 30 sept

6310035 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6310036 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present
6310037 we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned
6310038 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6310039 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6310040 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6310041 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6310042 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6310043 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6310044 in history there have only been two successful fashion dolls barbie and bratz and mr larian and mr bryant stole one of those
6310045 the numbers are what they are and the law says when you profit by taking someone elses confidential information you have to give it back
6310046 i thought it was possible to beat her as long as i was full of confidence because shes a defensive player

6310052 there is not much in the tank at the end of the day
6310053 i dont know that it was a death spiral but i mean it was a pretty dire situation
6310054 there have been very substantial gains at this point dont take any of this to imply that we think were anywhere near finished
6310055 you know touch wood there is still a lot of work to be done
6310056 the only statement i think somebody in a position like this can responsibly make is that it obviously depends on the conditions and how much risk one is willing to take

6310063 i seize this opportunity to fight maternal and infant mortality my primary concern
6310064 our children have this right because they are citizens just like the bantu
6310065 people in some areas are fighting for a bart station but here in san leandro you have two stations
6310066 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6310067 an mps primary duty is to his constituents raila odinga owes his share of power to the youth of kibera who not only voted for him but also rose up in arms to protest electoral rigging
6310068 we understand his limitations as he is only sharing political power with president kibaki but all we are asking for is the basic human dignity and survival
6310069 humanitarian assistance by international and local ngos is needed but it is not a substitute for the governments role a durable solution warrants political will and governmental action
6310070 there are no gangs or gang warfare as such in kibera it should be obvious to all that most people here work or are looking for work 65 per cent of nairobis industrial labour and workers force comes from kibera
6310071 and though the government does not recognise it as a formal settlement the officials of nairobi city council and other departments are always busy collecting taxes and other levies from the shopkeepers and traders of kibera
6310072 you can see its a vibrant place people live here you can see the potential of its people in the way they deal with their daily survival needs
6310073 for long weve had only two kinds of community leaders in kibera pastors and community politicians both have misled us now new leadership is emerging from within the youth that does not want to see the world through tribal and sectarian lenses
6310074 a solid platform is available to introduce new policies there is a strong force of young and organised men and women our mp can rely on
6310075 you cannot tar the entire sector with the same brush we have sought no funding and rely entirely on contributions from our members and individual supporters membership is not restricted to one ethnic or religious group it is our common suffering there is a need to face and address the trauma our communities especially women have suffered this year
6310076 as the government provides virtually no public service where would we be without the medical care hiv control programmes education and other essential projects run by the ngos the very fact that there is space for women like us to organise ourselves and to be able to work for promotion of peace is possible because of the years of effort put in by development workers from abroad and locally
6310077 it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6310078 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6310079 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
6310080 all three of them had done work with respect to the accelerator at brookhaven which walter wagner challenged back in the day
6310081 have apparently not educated themselves about the extensive analysis that has been done
6310082 theyre just being way off the wall on the facts
6310083 its wasting lots of time and effort to argue against this but i think its important to dispose of this as soon as possible
6310084 the three german physicists behind the research look at the different scenarios for the growth of black holes and contend that the collider couldnt put a black hole on a world threatening course
6310085 on the potential catastrophic risk from metastable quantum black holes produced at particle colliders
6310086 this paper written by german astrophysicist rainer plaga contends that tiny black holes could conceivably emit harmful radiation soon after they were produced and that such phenomena would
6310087 there is no way that the lhc will produce black holes capable of swallowing up the earth
6310088 this claim is based on extremely well tested theories of physics and on observations of the cosmos
6310089 but it is notable how often we have been asked about the problem
6310090 the beam of particles has the energy of a eurostar train traveling at full speed and should something happen to destabilize the particle beam there is a real danger that all of that energy will be deflected into the wall of the beam pipe and the magnets of the lhc causing a great deal of damage the lhc has several automatic safety systems in place that monitor all the critical parts of the lhc should anything unexpected happen power or magnet failure for example the beam is automatically dumped by being squirted into a blind tunnel where its energy is safely dissipated this all happens in milliseconds the beam which is traveling at 11 000 circuits of the lhc per second will complete less than three circuits before the dump is complete
6310091 in fact i think its wonderful if its done safely

6310110 defendant intended for customers to believe its statements and representations about the defective iphone 3gs and to trust that the device was twice as fast at half the price
6310111 immediately after purchase plaintiff soon noticed that her internet connection receipt and sending of e mail text messages and other data transfers were slower than expected and advertised
6310112 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6310113 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6310114 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6310115 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us

6310219 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment

6310225 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6310226 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6310227 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6310228 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6310229 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6310230 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6310231 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6310232 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6310233 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6310234 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6310235 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6310236 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6310237 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6310238 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6310239 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6310240 ive got to get it down in the zone every pitch instead of five out of 10 or whatever it is
6310241 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6310242 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6310243 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6310244 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6310245 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6310246 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6310247 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6310248 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6310249 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6310250 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6310251 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6310252 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6310253 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6310254 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6310255 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6310256 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6310257 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6310258 this has been kerris and my goal since the last ball dropped in athens its been a lot of hard work a lot of love a wonderful ride
6310259 weve never defeated a u s team in a big final theyre just too strong for us
6310260 hopefully in the next couple of years we can manage to beat them
6310261 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6310262 russia in this case will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic moves
6310263 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6310264 the united states of america will continue to support georgias democracy
6310265 are part of georgia and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6310266 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6310267 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6310268 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6310269 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6310270 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6310271 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6310272 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you
6310273 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6310274 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6310275 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6310276 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6310277 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6310278 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6310279 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6310280 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6310281 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6310282 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6310283 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6310284 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6310285 i wouldnt have any idea why he made the trip but i can hardly think of a time that he has invested in a big capital intensive thing
6310286 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6310287 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6310288 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6310289 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6310290 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6310291 our common erp system has laid the foundation for optimizing our national and international inter company processes
6310292 it is also helping us gear up to meet the requirements of an increasingly networked world
6310293 we are delighted to have bollhoff as another excellent reference in the manufacturing industry
6310294 our functionalities are a good fit for the needs of a company like bollhoff and they allow us to support our customers growth plans
6310295 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6310296 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6310297 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6310298 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6310299 rematik adalah penyakit yang banyak ditemukan karena tidak menyebabkan kematian rematik menjadi mudah untuk diabaikan kalau dulu rematik identik dengan orangtua sekarang remaja juga banyak yang terserang
6310300 kesulitan yang utama dialami oleh mereka yang menderita rematik adalah sulit bangun dan sulit mengenakan pakaian karena sendi yang bermasalah
6310301 pola makan yang sehat dan bervariasi menjaga keseimbangan antara aktivitas fisik dengan asupan makanan dan mengonsumsi gula secukupnya bisa mengurangi munculnya risiko rematik pada penderita obesitas
6310302 yang paling dilarang dikonsumsi oleh penderita rematik adalah kangkung jeroan dan alkohol
6310303 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6310304 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6310305 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
6310306 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6310307 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6310308 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6310309 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6310310 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6310311 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6310312 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6310313 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6310314 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6310315 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6310316 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6310317 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6310318 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6310319 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6310320 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6310321 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6310322 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6310323 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6310324 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6310325 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6310326 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6310327 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6310328 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6310329 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6310330 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6310331 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6310332 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6310333 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6310334 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6310335 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6310336 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6310337 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6310338 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6310339 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6310340 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6310341 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6310342 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6310343 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
6310344 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
6310345 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
6310346 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
6310347 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
6310348 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6310349 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6310350 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6310351 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6310352 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6310353 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6310354 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6310355 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6310356 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6310357 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6310358 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6310359 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6310360 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6310361 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6310362 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6310363 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6310364 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6310365 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6310366 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6310367 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

6310369 unfortunately we were caught in the last friday critical mass ride
6310370 everyone in tokyo rides bicycles i did almost all of my grocery shopping by bike on my housewife bike during the 7 years i lived there i love to ride a bike in the old fashioned sense of that phrase for pleasure not competition people routinely ring their bells in japan when they are coming up behind you and everyone endeavors to be careful it was a pleasure to ride there
6310371 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6310372 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6310373 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6310374 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6310375 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6310376 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6310377 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6310378 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6310379 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6310380 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6310381 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6310382 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6310383 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6310384 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6310385 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6310386 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6310387 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6310388 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6310389 they told me there are going to be resources here
6310390 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6310391 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6310392 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6310393 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6310394 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6310395 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6310396 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6310397 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6310398 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6310399 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6310400 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6310401 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6310402 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6310403 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6310404 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6310405 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6310406 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6310407 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6310408 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6310409 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6310410 that has it all together and he doesnt need any help
6310411 if she doesnt know and if shes innocent in these matters then i see no harm in telling antoine or anyone else where shes gone
6310412 i just dont know what it is she refuses to talk
6310413 i believe clarissa and her aunt could tell us a lot about the dealings of their family could expose that whole gang to any number of criminal charges
6310414 perhaps her own father would find a way to silence her to make sure she never talks maybe she knows something so terrible he would do that to his own daughter
6310415 she stopped as she saw the constable and i studying each other like two players over a chessboard
6310416 can i have your assurance that you will not repeat what i will tell you
6310417 i didnt come here tonight just to get antoine to bring charges
6310418 i apologize madame wolff if i have taken up too much of your time i truly hoped i could find a way to prosecute albert and his sons for this senseless act of violence in our town this immorality should not go unpunished
6310419 i have never liked or respected morris nor his sons but he has money and with that comes power he has ways just like any influential person in turning public opinion to his side of getting his own brand of justice
6310420 but he has gone too far now and his kind must be brought to trial
6310421 tomorrow i will arrest albert morris for the murder of simone churtz
6310422 i remembered those watery dead eyes of the woman on the pier
6310423 i thought that her death was the work of a wild animal like that woman found on the commons
6310424 she is a servant of albert morris i also have a witness who will claim this churtz woman was alberts lover
6310425 like i said madame since your son is reluctant to press charges
6310426 i wished to let antoine have his say in the matter after all he is the one who decided to face the morris brothers on the commons i cant say that many others would have done that
6310427 that simone churtz was found dead on the day of the gunfight maybe the poor woman knew something about albert morris and he silenced her made the killings look like a savage attack by an animal
6310428 that is my problem he is also in the employ of morris but he may be unreliable
6310429 so you think clarissa may know of her fathers affair with this woman
6310430 why dont you just go to the aunt or to the other servants
6310431 but you cant be sure constable can you that is why you have come to me
6310432 i dont mean to be a gossip or point a finger at you antoine but it is no secret you are quite taken with the daughter of albert morris the trouble all began when you invited her to your party
6310433 do you think she will tell me what happened in that house
6310434 monsieur you are not going to use my son just to
6310435 of course she couldnt stop asking about you when i went to question her i think she is dying to see you
6310436 but what if she doesnt tell you anything what if she is putting herself in danger
6310437 how can you be so sure it was albert who killed
6310438 i will arrest him madame as soon as i have the information i need
6310439 and rest assured no one will exact revenge once i have the head of the snake in my hands
6310440 if the morris family takes revenge once you arrest him then it will only make monsieur albert more guilty
6310441 precisely knowing that their patriarch their leader is facing a charge of murder and a sentence of death they wouldnt dare do anything to encourage us to hang him
6310442 and you wont trouble mademoiselle morris you wont speak to her of anything we discussed
6310443 i will bring her to your house at a convenient hour
6310444 after i talk to her you will arrest her father
6310445 as soon as possible all i need to confirm is that he had an affair with the dead girl that will be reason enough to earn my pay
6310446 i can wait downstairs im certainly not going to let the girl travel alone in this town she must have an escort
6310447 yes of course we can have lunch together here in my room
6310448 thank you antoine we will see you in the morning
6310449 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6310450 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6310451 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6310452 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6310453 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6310454 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6310455 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6310456 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6310457 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6310458 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6310459 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6310460 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6310461 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6310462 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6310463 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

6310470 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6310471 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6310472 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6310473 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6310474 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6310475 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6310476 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6310477 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6310478 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

6310497 frankly chinas economic growth is important to global economic growth and is a positive for the united states the real concern should be if china stumbles or has problems along the way and that this hurts global markets the global economy hurts our economy
6310498 we have very much of a shared interest in the energy area we are both very large importers of oil we share the same energy security issues we both are hurt by disruptions and we both benefit if there is more efficiency
6310499 there are a number of ways we can collaborate and on the environmental issues we cannot solve climate issues without cooperation and engagement with china and the development of new technologies

6310552 we have proposed to sanzar that a bye be included when new zealand tour south africa next year
6310553 we will then play the all blacks twice and the wallabies once just after the tour by the british and irish lions
6310554 it travelling will always favour them australia and new zealand when they come here the time difference favours them they gain a day but we lose a day when we fly there then you also have to play for financial reasons on consecutive saturdays

6310558 there should be an opportunity for students to be educated about alcohol and right now we cant do it in good conscience we have to tell students that its illegal to drink but if you are going to drink this is how you should do it that is a mix message to send students
6310559 the 21 year old age limit does not prevent binge drinking it happens in campuses across the country and i think if we were able to show responsible drinking and modeled responsible drinking and we educate students about it would be very beneficial for everybody
6310560 i support this initiative because it will allow our colleges to engage in real education of our students about responsible use of alcohol as well as model moderate behavior at present we are constrained only to talk about abstinence since anything else is against the law treating college students as adults will help them to make more responsible decisions
6310561 speakers like bill clinton and justice antonin scalia dropped by last spring and neither was tarred and feathered

6310565 a college with which i am affiliated discovered that its alma mater was written for a blackface minstrel show in the 1900s although the lyrics are innocuous the school banned the song from this years graduation and formed a group to discuss its future use part of a campaign to make students aware of things they take for granted is this a good response or should the school focus on more important issues is it unethical to sing the song

6310574 thus we already have three worlds undoubtedly however the number is even greater we are just too far away to see
6310575 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
6310576 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
6310577 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
6310578 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils
6310579 ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place
6310580 policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives
6310581 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
6310582 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
6310583 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
6310584 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
6310585 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
6310586 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
6310587 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
6310588 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility

6310607 he initially said some of the students were being harassed
6310608 i asked you to voluntarily remove your video from youtube because you had no authority to publish it i explained that you needed to obtain for starters the students consent before doing so
6310609 as a result of a third party notification by claremont graduate university claiming that this material is infringing
6310610 i dont see any legal basis to request student faces to be blurred based on the facts as i understand them
6310611 the web site i paid for it to be up for a year
6310612 i didnt want all the art to pile up on me
6310613 the knowledge of individuals taken as a whole is far greater than that of any commission or board however diligent and expert the magic of the system of prices and of economic markets is that they incorporate a great deal of diffuse knowledge
6310614 a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action
6310615 it looks as if hes done far better than just passing
6310616 if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
6310617 i didnt take it lightly that a high priced lawyer who has represented celebrities like cameron diaz and lou rawls was hired by officials at a university with unlimited spending power to make my life miserable i had no idea to what lengths claremont graduate university would go to jerk around a little guy exercising his first amendment rights
6310618 claremont officials had enough appreciation for free speech to allow an armenian genocide denier to speak as an honored guest at their university but when it came to news coverage of the event which is protected by the untied states constitution they seemingly concocted a reason to squash free speech i can only assume the phone call from a lawyer was a not too subtle effort to shut me up
6310619 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math

6310649 la postergaci n no nos causar mucho da o sino que por el contrario puede traernos ventajas all ellos la clase dominante lama sta con sus fechor as e injusticia contra el pueblo nosotros a nuestro turno nos dedicamos a hacer cosas buenas tales como la producci n el comercio la construcci n de caminos el servicio m dico y el trabajo de frente nico uni n con la mayor a y educaci n paciente con el objeto de ganarnos a las masas
6310650 los jan trabajaban hombro a hombro con nosotros no nos azotaban por primera vez me trataban como un ser humano
6310651 comprendimos que no era la voluntad de los dioses sino la crueldad de seres humanos como nosotros lo que nos ten a esclavizados
6310652 en las llanuras la gran revoluci n socialista ha sido una lucha de clases muy violenta
6310653 en la historia de la humanidad toda fuerza reaccionaria que est a punto de perecer se lanza invariablemente a una ltima y desesperada embestida contra las fuerzas revolucionarias
6310654 nos dijeron que si mat bamos a un jan ser amos budas vivientes y construir an capillas en nombre nuestro

6310656 el sol del kashag brillaba nicamente para los tres amos y los matones de los terratenientes pero el sol del partido comunista y el presidente mao brilla para nosotros los pobres
6310657 hacer la revoluci n no es ofrecer un banquete una revoluci n es una insurrecci n es un acto de violencia mediante el cual una clase derroca a otra sin recurrir a la m xima fuerza el campesinado jam s lograr a derrocar el poder de los terratenientes profundamente arraigado a trav s de los milenios
6310658 en algunos lugares vienen acusando una grave anormalidad las relaciones entre las nacionalidades tal situaci n es intolerable para los comunistas es indispensable criticar a fondo las ideas chovinistas de gran jan que se manifiestan de modo grave entre muchos militantes y cuadros de nuestro partido ideas reaccionarias de la clase terrateniente y la burgues a reflejadas en las relaciones entre las nacionalidades en otras palabras las ideas burguesas dominan en la mente de una parte de los camaradas y del pueblo que no ha recibido una educaci n marxista ni asimilado la pol tica del comit central sobre la cuesti n nacional
6310659 ponemos el acento en el combate al chovinismo de gran jan hay que combatir tambi n el nacionalismo local pero este por lo com n no es el blanco principal en el pasado los gobernantes reaccionarios sobre todo los de la nacionalidad jan levantaron toda clase de barreras entre las diversas nacionalidades y atropellaron a las minor as nacionales las consecuencias de todo esto no son f ciles de liquidar en corto tiempo ni siquiera dentro del pueblo trabajador el aire del espacio los bosques de la tierra y las riquezas del subsuelo son todos importantes elementos indispensables para la construcci n del socialismo pero ning n factor material puede ser explotado y aprovechado sino por el factor hombre debemos trabajar porque haya buenas relaciones entre la nacionalidad jan y las minor as nacionales y consolidar la unidad entre ellas para edificar nuestra gran patria socialista con los esfuerzos de todos

6310672 you give and take away but my heart will choose to say lord blessed be your name
6310673 they are a pretty aggressive bunch our secondary and linebackers saw a lot of playing time last year
6310674 i would say our team speed is a a from last years a
6310675 they are both good quality quarterbacks who anticipate to both play
6310676 each are good at different things and i look for them to rotate
6310677 said buck whose brother mitch is now the head coach at league foe bonneville
6310678 with a tough non league schedule i think its good we play our league games at the end of the season because by that time our young guys will be ready
6310679 we certainly dont think too much about the streak it is nice to have had that success and tradition and i think that our teams play off that
6310680 i would rather be in this position rather than trying to knock someone off who is 21 0 but i am just really proud of what we have been able to do here at shelley over the last six years great kids i have a great coaching staff and the community support has just been tremendous
6310681 phillips and fellows are two very talented running backs they are quick tough and i think that they have the potential to be as good of a pair of running backs that we have had here
6310682 i think that our defense will be the strongest part of our team this season
6310683 we should be real strong at linebacker defensive end and our defensive backs should be very athletic
6310684 our first four games of the season are difficult you couldnt ask for a tougher start to the season
6310685 i think that it will be a good opportunity for us to get knocked down and well see how we get back up i hope that we gel i hope that we come together in a hurry because our league is much improved i know that we are probably the favorites because weve been there before but i truly believe that it is any ones ballgame this year
6310686 af is coming off its best season in a long time and marsh valley has a great group of young athletes bear lake will return a couple of real good athletes too
6310687 snake returns most of their front seven and should be strong against the run
6310688 the secondary will be young though and will need to gain experience
6310689 right now it is a matter of making it work together
6310690 we have a lot young guys up from the jv who will help us
6310691 they are really picking up the offense really fast quarterback wyatt jolley was their backup last year and will be a big part of our team this year
6310692 colter will obviously be a big part of our team
6310693 i think we are strong in the skilled position areas and at linebacker and corner
6310694 this is the biggest returning class that we have had in recent memory
6310695 we are really deep with seniors we have a senior at nearly every position and not only that but they are real good real smart kids
6310696 we have lots of different people on offense that can carry us we just dont have a lot of weaknesses
6310697 i wouldnt say that we have a lot of superstars but i believe that we are solid at every position
6310698 every year we set out with the goal of winning a title but we dont want to get ahead of ourselves so we will take it one week at a time
6310699 west side is always tough they are the defending champions and i think that malad is really loaded this year
6310700 i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6310701 it was a much more amazing start than he got in the 100 meters and then his turn was just absolutely fabulous
6310702 it was a tough decision but this is something that i have always wanted to do
6310703 at quan sports marketing we will work with various teams on a wide range of duties and eventually focus on a core business that will help athletes with their charitable events and foundations
6310704 a low power mynetwork tv affilitate will not participate in the experiment and the local noncommercial station which broadcasts only a statewide feed will continue in analog and be the primary analog source for emergency information should it be needed
6310705 stations will have many more viewers in two years after the switch than before
6310706 the revolt of the working class always increasing in numbers and united organized and disciplined by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production
6310707 will be the first revolution in history to require the masses to make material sacrifices rather than to acquire more material things we must give up many of the things which this country has enjoyed at the expense of damning over one third of the world into a state of underdevelopment ignorance disease and early death
6310708 this country will not be safe for the world and revolutionary warfare on an international scale against the united states will remain the wave of the present
6310709 it is obviously going to take a tremendous transformation to prepare the people of the united states for these new social goals
6310710 but potential revolutionaries can only become true revolutionaries if they take the side of those who believe that humanity can be transformed
6310711 rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter but beautiful struggle for a new world
6310712 my grace is sufficient for you for power is made perfect in weakness
6310713 i am ashamed of myself and i want to apologize to you
6310714 i have been able for these past two years to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your masters house because of my flaws you have to do all of this work and you dont get full value from your efforts
6310715 as we return to the masters house i want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path
6310716 did you notice that there were lot of flowers on your side of your path thats because i have always known about your flaw and i took advantage of it i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back from the stream youve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house
6310717 you never feel completely comfortable in this ball park but with the wind blowing in today it made it a little easier to pitch to some of the tough guys in the middle of the order

6310734 in 2007 we received us 3 million us 1 5 million from the un central emergency response fund and us 1 5 from the european commissions humanitarian aid department and provided inputs to farmers so that when rains returned this year 2008 they produced better yields
6310735 a bag of fertiliser that cost r200 about 26 last year has gone up two fold to r600 about 78 its been two months since i consulted our seed supplier and back then prices had gone up 15 percent from last year theyll be higher now that we are nearing planting season
6310736 we have to strategise how to use what funding we have this year for inputs but at harvest time there is going to be a problem
6310737 climate change has permanently affected swazilands ability to produce food the old days when we got all the rainfall we needed for crops wont come back but there are other solutions
6310738 the planting season used to start in september now you find it is october or even november
6310739 ive been saying for a long time that climate change has hurt swaziland and we must find new ways of farming to compensate
6310740 we have answers to swazilands food production problems but they require long term funding because they are long term solutions they cant fix the food shortage situation in one year but they can in future
6310741 yields were up the farmers are continuing to practice what theyve learned after the programme finished and their yields remain high no matter which region of the country they are

6310747 it is a feat of technology and beauty ive admired too many times to count
6310748 but ill always remember the first time i saw it because my czech cousin david was with me and explained the legend of the clock that the man who commissioned it had the eyes of the clockmaker gouged out so that he could never build anything like it again
6310749 her father has been commissioned by the young prince of bohemia to design a clock in the center of faraway prague but when its finished the prince removes and enchants the clockmakers eyes deciding to wear them himself

6310751 people are born with only one magical talent which often involves the ability to influence a material substance like metal glass or fire or it can be purely mental such as being able to see the future
6310752 magic usually manifests itself in the elite upper class it begins to appear when people are about 14 years old which is also the age when children become adults
6310753 these pamphlets were basically the 16th century equivalent of a bat boy found in cave tabloid
6310754 some renaissance people believed in magic so whenever i read a yellowed document about prophetic children or a woman who gave birth to 365 mouse sized babies i could never tell whether the writer thought it was fact or fiction
6310755 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course

6310758 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power

6310765 our minimum wage is presently 522 15 a week todays decision takes that to 546 65 it is good news for workers thatthe irc accepted our arguments
6310766 our cpi over the past 12 monthshas been higher than the rest of the nation working families here are feelingthe pressure of climbing interest rates higher fuel and food costs and risingbills
6310767 todays decision is yet furtherevidence of the need to scrap the fair pay commission in favour of a bettersystem
6310768 ircs around the country have awarded their workers rises about thefpc level and now sa has too again demonstrating the inadequacy of the fpc
6310769 the fair pay commission is ajoke the state ircs are clearly more responsive to workers needs thisdecision creates two classes of workers in a those on state awards gettingmore than those on federal awards despite doing the same work its justplain unfair
6310770 we need a strong national wagessafety net enshrined in law that delivers fairness for workers while balancingthe interests of business the fpc has failed and should be jettisoned clearing the way for the reinstatement of a truly fair system that givesworkers a say

6310798 i would like people to see dance as an education an approach that is missing in india elegance which is the most important aspect of dance is in abundance in the women here there is wakefulness as well as potential around my ambition is to qualify teachers who are internationally certified to create competitors who will put the floor in motion globally
6310799 i would label my tryst with the dance enthusiasts in india very successful salsa is extremely popular here but the other dance forms need to be introduced by qualified teachers the styles will hopefully become very popular in the next three years the dance styles evolve each day and one needs to keep oneself updated to pass on authentic knowledge i sometimes observe imperfect methods of teaching my ambition is to create able trainers who can pass authentic knowledge many youngsters here want to follow dance and therefore i want to help them utilise the opportunities available to become global competitors
6310800 some of the reality shows to a degree portray the actual dance styles most of the times it is a fusion of two or more however they have created a lot of awareness in england the age group of learners varies from five years to 50 years it is a misconception that the dance is limited to the youth
6310801 in an attempt to improve highway safety prunty county recently lowered its speed limit from 55 miles per hour to 45 on all major county roads but the 55 mph limit should be restored because this safety effort has failed most drivers are exceeding the new speed limit and the accident rate throughout prunty county has decreased only slightly if we want to improve the safety of our roads we should instead undertake the same kind of road improvement project that butler county completed five years ago increasing lane widths and resurfacing rough roads today major butler county roads still have a 55 mph speed limit yet there were 25 percent fewer reported accidents in butler county this past year than there were five years ago

6310820 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
6310821 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
6310822 let me make it clear i am being treated for cancer

6310826 thats an accounting decision weve made we dont provide a commentary on every line item in the report
6310827 all of us at qantas are disappointed with the number of recent incidents and we do not step away from the fact that the incident on qf30 in manila was very serious
6310828 all we can do logically about the situation we have done
6310829 it should be the boards who make this call not the players
6310830 they know our view we are not proposing to do any more until we hear from them
6310831 we are confident that the icc has got a very clear understanding of what the views are around not just australia but a number of senior icc member nations
6310832 with the champions trophy about 20 days away shouldnt that have been the main talking point
6310833 it doesnt bother him im a bit nervous but him nothing christian said today
6310834 the cameras were coming on this morning its good experience for him because hes got to get use to that hes not fussed by anything
6310835 he doesnt even want to know who hes fighting it just doesnt bother him
6310836 i saw his parents the other day after training and said this is a big fight they said is it he didnt tell us anything
6310837 he doesnt want to see tapes or anything like that he says put me in front of them and ill fight them its a very carefree attitude
6310838 its a good thing hes not overawed by who hes fighting and hes kinda like that bloke bolt that just won the olympic 100 and 200 metres hes not fussed
6310839 if the opportunity came tomorrow wed take it and we would win but we would be in even better stead if he had five more fights christian said

6310841 look what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps
6310842 these are the issues that they want us to deal with you will see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6310843 working pretty closely together on georgia and issues related to afghanistan
6310844 the article he wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are debates that all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in
6310845 weve got to be prepared for anything that may happen
6310846 we are doing everything in our power to protect our forces
6310847 human rights matters to us every year not just in olympic year
6310848 we want them to extend the greater freedoms that they have given to journalists and the press at the time of the olympics beyond the olympics and further on
6310849 there is an obligation to emphasise that the governments position and public consensus rule out returning to the 1967 lines
6310850 we know that people are going to use the printer to try to make weapons and sex toys and drug paraphernalia
6310851 just because i am drunk does not make me fair game for violation
6310852 women as sexless beings have to act as gatekeepers to the act of sex and therefore are duty bound to keep their sober wits about them those who dont deserve whats coming and probably for that matter asked for it
6310853 huh well if not even women can stick up for themselves in court what do they expect

6310856 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6310857 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6310858 a lot of people said mark and i wouldnt work out then but we proved them wrong and im looking forward to working side by side with him in the enduros again tander said
6310859 we were on pole in both races and while the results may have gone pear shaped for other reasons everything else went smoothly we had no issues and the working relationship was fine
6310860 garth and mark present one of the strongest driver combinations in the field and allow us to put our best foot forward crawford said
6310861 this is the best possible strategy for us to look after garths championship while still chasing race wins
6310862 both guys know what it takes to win enduro races and look after the car so im confident that if we get a straight run at it we can look after both of those objectives
6310863 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6310864 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6310865 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6310866 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6310867 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6310868 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6310869 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6310870 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6310871 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6310872 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6310873 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6310874 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6310875 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6310876 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6310877 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6310878 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6310879 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6310880 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6310881 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6310882 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6310883 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6310884 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6310885 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6310886 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6310887 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6310889 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6310890 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6310891 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6310892 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6310893 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6310894 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6310895 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6310896 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6310897 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6310898 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6310899 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6310900 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6310901 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6310902 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6310903 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6310904 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6310905 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6310906 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6310907 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6310908 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6310909 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6310910 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6310911 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6310912 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6310913 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6310914 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6310915 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6310916 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

6310920 die schwimmer beklagen sich immer dass sie zu wenig fernsehzeiten h tten britta steffen w re zur prime time in deutschland im fernsehen gewesen
6310921 britta hat sich bestimmt nie dar ber beklagt dass sie zu wenig fernsehzeit hat
6310922 sie h tte bei waldi und harry ja ohnehin nichts neues erz hlen k nnen sie hatte doch schon alles gesagt
6310923 ich kann noch nichts sagen ich habe britta noch nicht gesehen entweder war sie bei einer pressekonferenz oder sie war bei der dopingkontrolle
6310924 die leute in der ard waren st ndig auf dem laufenden wie gerade der sachstand war
6310925 ard und zdf stellen uns f r unsere pressekonferenz die technische ausstattung zur verf gung weil diese ausstattung ja sowieso aufgebaut ist

6310927 as playstation network evolve with the recently established distribution of video games and more exclusive ps3 owners are asked about more capacity
6310928 consumers are also available with the ps3 as a centre for digital home entertainment media such as the contents of their entire music collection on your hard drive the system of 160 gb ps3 this growing demand of consumers in one package provides significant value
6310929 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6310930 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6310931 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6310932 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6310933 men best show their character in trifles when they are not on their guard it is in insignificant matters and in the simplest habits that we often see the boundless egotism which pays no regard to the feeling of others and denies nothing to itself
6310934 the accc is seeking a range of remedies including injunctions restraining the respondent from engaging in the conduct and declarations concerning the conduct alleged by the accc
6310935 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6310936 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6310937 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6310938 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6310939 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6310940 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6310941 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6310942 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6310943 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6310944 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6310945 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6310946 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6310947 le gouvernement est boulevers tr s touch par cette trag die
6310948 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6310949 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6310950 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6310951 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6310952 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6310954 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6310955 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6310956 this is a planning took where all things are going
6310957 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6310958 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6310959 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6310960 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6310961 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6310962 we cannot cure this problem ourselves we are a minuscule part of global emissions
6310963 for three of them the effect is fatal for another couple very likely so and these are fairly large effects
6310964 we do believe it provides an incentive to move to low emissions technology
6310965 they would be the ones morally responsible for electing a pro choice president
6310966 mr king turned the argument on its head saying that electing an anti abortion president in mr mccain outweighs the risk of a more conservative vice presidential pick that would ultimately lose to senator obama in november

6310975 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6310976 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6310977 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6310978 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6310979 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6310980 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6310981 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6310982 councils are already supporting much needed community facilities including rescuing local post offices from closure and investing in the retail and transport infrastructure allowing local government to carefully intervene and support homeowners is a sensible step which we urge ministers to consider seriously
6310983 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans
6310984 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do
6310985 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6310986 we currently have the lowest standard variable rate of all the major banks and st george

6311003 mccain and pawlenty together are very far to the right of me on abortion rights obama and kaine though to the left of me seem to have a more subtle approach to abortion rights
6311004 msnbc commentator pat buchanan says hes been told other outside groups are planning their own ad campaigns on mr obamas abortion votes
6311005 look at us we represent the middleground on abortion and mccain whoever represents the far right fringe that would return us to the dark ages of back alley abortions and anti woman legislation blahblahblah
6311006 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6311007 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6311008 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6311009 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6311010 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6311011 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6311012 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6311013 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6311014 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6311015 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6311016 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6311017 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6311018 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6311019 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6311020 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6311021 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6311022 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6311023 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6311024 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6311025 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6311026 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6311027 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6311028 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6311029 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6311030 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6311031 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6311032 woods delusional beliefs are true to him and always presented in grandiose fashion

6311042 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6311043 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

6311052 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6311053 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6311054 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6311055 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right

6311064 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education

6311066 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6311067 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6311068 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6311069 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now

6311144 do not curve the hand around the shoulder but rather ascend over the top pivoting from the thumb which should be under the neck in a hitch hiking hitch hike just before the need to rise up and over
6311145 i cant figure out how to move my thumb from under the neck smoothly when shifting and when i do im not sure where to put it on the shoulder or along side of the fingerboard
6311146 generally my thumb ends up somewhere near the violin shoulder and is drastically stretched to allow my fingers to reach this in turn causes my fingers to end up almost flat across the fingerboard to hit the notes
6311147 we are targeting 9 per cent growth getting up to 10 per cent it may look ambitious with the global economic slowdown but in the medium term it is achievable

6311176 for an organization that has come to rely heavily on words and symbolism nato issued a disconcertingly evasive communiqu at its emergency meeting on georgia
6311177 the first mention of russia appears only in the second paragraph and it is a positive mention nato welcomes the armistice agreement reached and signed by georgia and russia no reference to the russian military duress under which this flawed armistice was reached the communiqu urges prompt good faith implementation of the armistice politely ignoring its loopholes

6311183 how and why julio c sar gallegoss body ended up on the scorched desert terrain of southern california is the outgrowth of many factors contingent and structural incidental and historical
6311184 while shaped to a significant degree by physical forces geographic space is largely a social creation in terms of what is contained within it how it is divided up and bounded and how it is perceived and lived it is thus a product of power relations and all the conflict as well as cooperation that they entail
6311185 from a mere line on a map to a powerful divide and associated set of practices of inclusion and exclusion
6311186 is not so much to stop migration but to define the status of people as subordinate once they have arrived
6311187 i stopped at food town and saw a recruitment newspaper there it had a job opening for a job that i did
6311188 those three players will be very big for us ron mccormick our goalie is a huge key were almost all seniors i think this will be the strongest team since ive been here
6311189 with us losing eight starters from last years team we have our work cut out for us but we may surprise a few people this year a lot of our success comes down to how quickly some of the players can mature we will be a possession based team our schedule is again the toughest in the area we look forward to a tough season but one in which we can continue to learn the technical and tactical points of the game
6311190 we have a pretty small team this year i have a couple who havent come to practice yet theres a big possibility we will only have 10 for our first match this is our first year as an official varsity team
6311191 were going to struggle this year we lost three starting seniors who scored over two thirds of our goals we are strong defensively and at midfield we need some guys to step up offensively
6311192 were re tooling we graduated 11 seniors and we only have three seniors this year were going to be very very young im heavily laden with freshmen and sophomores theyre going to have a baptism by fire
6311193 were young we have three seniors but a lot of freshmen we have to replace brad puchalsky who scored 37 goals last year this is our largest team ever at 18 kids
6311194 we have to replace our two top players from last year chris billau and brandon duval who are both playing in college we havent had trouble scoring goals in our spring competition they key will be our defense
6311195 its a very young team with a lot of juniors sophomores and freshmen we only have three seniors theyve all worked hard and theyre starting to come together i believe were going to have an enjoyable season
6311196 we have a pretty solid team pretty much our entire defense is back from last year a lot of the teams in our league had some key losses in personnel i think we can be in the top three in our league
6311197 we have 13 returning players and nine returning starters from a team that won 14 matches last year the pieces are in place goalie is our biggest concern right now a junior and a freshman are competing to start it helps that we have three all district defenders playing in front of him
6311198 im only replacing three players and we return eight starters only two teams beat us last year it looks like a good season benjy played for a premier 18 club were expecting a lot from him
6311199 vier tage vor der tat war die kindsmutter zur so genannten
6311200 i think this night we took another step im happy i saw things i have doubts about
6311201 im happy with the draw because the reaction of the team to the last minute was important and good
6311202 i think also in the first half we played good football with style we created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together better with different style
6311203 only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs countered we suffered this is a problem and we have to do something about the problem
6311204 in the second half we lost the style and position and the czechs are a very good team
6311205 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6311206 when a team plays the counter attack it is not easy to score a goal
6311207 he did not play left so you have to explain that
6311208 we played 4 3 2 1 jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney then three midfielders
6311209 in that position you have to play between the lines of the full backs and midfield
6311210 i decided before the games that rooney and gerrard they had only played one game will play this for an hour
6311211 it was a difficult night playing against a good team early on in the season and most of us played on sunday
6311212 it was a tough game but we got a good draw against a good side but we are disappointed not to have won
6311213 but we havent been beaten we are building our confidence and getting stronger
6311214 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6311215 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there tonight and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6311216 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6311217 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6311218 it is important to do that when the business of the qualifying campaign begins and we are keen to make up for what happened last time
6311219 for us it was a very difficult match against capello we knew this
6311220 we went into the match with the idea to survive which we managed by keeping the ball in midfield and attacking from the breaks
6311221 i think we were controlling the game in the second half at 2 1 we had a big chance to score again and if he scored we probably would have been winners of this match
6311222 the key reason for the revival in early rising culture is that it teaches people to control their emotions feelings and desires
6311223 it is training in spiritual determination so people feel motivated to contribute selflessly to a common cause
6311224 that cause can often be economic but there are clear signs that many of these movements encourage people to take pride in their country and the part they play in japanese life in some ways they are being urged to overcome their own spiritual weaknesses and replace them with nationalist pride
6311225 early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
6311226 it will be a bad day for the democracy and country if judges are not reinstated
6311227 were all in this together so theres a role for each one of us to play in being a part of the solution to these critical issues

6311245 senator mark lamented the spate of gruesome murders by unknown persons and challenged security operatives to rise to the occasion
6311246 in a condolence message to the family of the deceased management and staff of thisday newspapers limited senator mark charged security operatives to fish out the killers of ogundeji and make them face the wrath of the law
6311247 the president of the senate expressed worries that besides the incessant killings most of the cases have remained unresolved a development which he said has raised anxiety and tension in the land
6311248 he therefore urged government at all levels to make security a top priority in their budgetary allocations saying otherwise we will continue to live in perpetual fear without knowing who the next victim would be
6311249 the rule of law and the challenges of law enforcement
6311250 is arbitrary and anti thetical to the tenets of the rule of law
6311251 the police in protecting and operating within the law will be seen institutionally as good corporate citizens
6311252 this is a burden something all of us leaders must shoulder nigerians cannot even rely on the state for protection of lives and property we have lost yet another life to assassins who seem to be outnumbering our security agencies
6311253 went to the police station and would soon be back
6311254 that part of the account touched me for the four year old boy daddy was safe after all we teach our kids that police is your friend so it would take him a long time to realise that his father would never come back from the imaginary police station
6311255 regardless of the perceived offences of the men it is not for the military but for the law courts to decide on the penalty for each of the individuals this action again demonstrates the indiscipline and frustration of the nigerian military
6311256 there has never been a time when the jtf operation flush out iii has killed or conducted extra judicial killing during or after any operation we have never done that before we have not done it and will not do it
6311257 those liable will be prosecuted and those that are not culpable will be released as well that has been a standing tradition of the jtf so the purported extra judicial killing by mend is baseless

6311502 i had a meeting two days ago where we were talking about countries to tour and i said we have to go to australia
6311503 in the past it was very taboo for an artist to do something other than endorse a soft drink its like you were selling out if you were to go beyond that

6311552 w ith those resources which would take years to develop you would only postpone or temporarily relieve our dependency on fossil fuels
6311553 we are going to have to go to alternative energy and the exploitation of existing reserves of oil natural gas even coal and we can develop clean coal technology are all great things but we also have to devote our efforts in my view to alternative energy sources which is the ultimate answer to our long term energy needs and we need it sooner rather than later
6311554 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
6311555 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
6311556 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation

6311558 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6311559 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6311560 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6311561 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6311562 i never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking
6311563 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6311564 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6311565 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6311566 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6311567 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6311568 but putting things on the skin puts them straight into your blood stream

6311575 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6311576 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6311577 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent
6311578 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6311579 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6311580 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6311581 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6311582 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference

6311589 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly 10 i can only take you so seriously
6311590 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6311591 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6311592 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6311593 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6311594 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6311595 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6311596 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6311597 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6311598 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6311599 for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice
6311600 i believe this is the only case in the history of our republic where so many people have had to travel so far
6311601 los angeles is closer london is about the same distance
6311602 the defendant is only a punching bag at this stage
6311603 i dont know why this case has to be brought so soon before an election
6311604 i wanted alaskans to have a firsthand opportunity to learn the facts of this matter
6311605 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6311606 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6311607 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6311608 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6311609 both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in iraq
6311610 been law for eight years now and taxpayers are used to those rates
6311611 allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase
6311612 its skewed toward upper income americans to the exclusion of most everyone else
6311613 youre a family making less than 250 000 a year you will not see your taxes go up
6311614 over time it would mean less capital accumulated and would ultimately force wages lower
6311615 the obama tax plan is to be preferred on grounds of tax equity
6311616 and because its more fiscally responsible it is also likely to lead to better economic growth
6311617 using taxpayer money to bail them out looks like its becoming reality now
6311618 is the single most important factor to their ability to remain liquid
6311619 continues to have strong access to the debt markets at attractive spreads
6311620 treasury is monitoring market developments vigilantly we are focused on encouraging market stability mortgage availability and protecting the taxpayers interests
6311621 the conditions dont seem to be turning into a good environment
6311622 see that youre now strong see that youre now healthy see that you have become prosperous because you are loved of god and god wants you sound well and prosperous

6311624 some of you will begin to receive miracles as you leave this place and things will happen even after you get home
6311625 phillips has always been very good at talking himself up but he hasnt always backed it up
6311626 hes hugely physically talented but theres always been a question mark over his mental capabilities
6311627 hes never won a global outdoors title hes won a world indoors hes won a commonwealths but hes never performed at a worlds and only finished sixth at one olympics
6311628 as hes come through with an expectation from the outside that he can win a medal he hasnt done so even at
6311629 the difference this year is that hes jumped consistently far all summer and ive never seen him do that before
6311630 hes always had the confidence what i look at is how hes performed thats all that matters and this season outdoors
6311631 barely put one foot in front of the other let alone triple jump
6311632 i would sit here and say its really hard being favourite theres a fear of failure
6311633 phillips wouldnt do that were very different personalities on the surface hell love being favourite with the eyes of the world on him
6311634 in terms of his conscious thought processes he really likes being the centre of attention hes got red hair and piercings this is a man saying look at me im the real deal
6311635 but its got to have an effect knowing that a silver medal will be seen as a failure and phillips has shown himself to be susceptible under pressure in the past
6311636 ive always said with phillips that if he doesnt do it in the first two jumps then hes not going to do it
6311637 thats been true until this summer at the european cup he went poor first jump okay second jump great third jump after a bad start at crystal palace he produced big jumps in both round four and five
6311638 the phillips idowu of previous years wouldnt have done that he would have kept on going downhill and downhill
6311639 i would still be nervous if we got to round three of the final here and phillips had only jumped 17 20 and the lead was 17 60
6311640 i still believe that if hes going to jump really big hell do it in the first few rounds thats the kind of athlete he is
6311641 we shouldnt be surprised if he doesnt win it because hes never won a major title outdoors it would be a huge disappointment but it wouldnt be the massive shock it was when i lost in atlanta
6311642 but the way hes looked this summer with the technical consistency i wouldnt be in the last bit surprised if he opened up with 17 80m
6311643 seems to be but i met him just a few hours ago
6311644 yeah but id be pretty surprised if he bites now hes only 9 weeks old
6311645 no like i said i just met him youre on your own he didnt bite me when i met him of course i had a treat in my hand innocent smile
6311646 what do you think about our next child coming from ethiopia
6311647 i am here to apologize and to pledge that we will do everything that we can and we have been doing for the last five years in a very focused way to see that this will never happen again
6311648 forsooth milady it seems i shall cum onto your tits

6311652 oh take cows from milk farms out of cages and require them to build pastures what a great feel good idea

6311654 sayangnya program uso harus terhenti sejenak karena pemerintah masih menghadapi kasus hukum yang harus dipatuhi namun begitu pemerintah tidak menutup dukungan terhadap operator penyelenggara telekomunikasi yang ingin membuka jalur komunikasi di desa desa tertinggal
6311655 tahun ini penurunannya lumayan besar karena kita lihat biaya investasi semakin turun jadi ini harusnya sudah diantisipasi oleh para operator apalagi ke depan akan masuk era internet protocol ip dengan teknologi tersebut tarif suara bisa sampai nol rupiah
6311656 itu dapat terlihat dari kemampuan telekomunikasi menahan laju inflasi beberapa bulan lalu lagipula mensejahterakan rakyat itu kan tidak hanya dalam bentuk sumbangan dividen ke negara bisa juga dengan cara seperti penurunan tarif yang lebih dirasakan ratusan jutaan rakyat
6311657 these kids struggle everyday with this to this day theyre my kids its not going to straighten out but they can try to move on with their lives and get better in both instances
6311658 in the settlement there is supposed to be some avenues for the parents to have psychiatric help i need it
6311659 that they somehow could lead a life that was god gave them before this had happened if this could just be taken out of their life and they would have just skipped that step and go on and have that kind of a life thats what i would like

6311678 if georgian president mikheil saakashvilis absurd demand that the peacekeeping operation be halted in abkhazia is implemented the region will risk being plunged deeper into crisis by the unhealthy ambitions of the incumbent georgian authorities

6311708 sorry bout that mister some tomater juicell take care of the stank
6311709 shoot barack you didnt tell me you was runnin for president
6311710 what sen obamas half brother meant to communicate was that he was pleased that the candidates message of change is fostering vigorous dialogue
6311711 in no way was his proposal to fill yalls backsides with rock salt intended to be taken in any other way
6311712 i thought we would be able to escape controversy by leaving the country for a week and visiting iraq and europe
6311713 little did we know that cooter would command just as much attention back home by getting drunk with the russian ambassador lighting off fireworks and crashing obamas campaign limo into a creek in the ozark mountains

6311720 given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation
6311721 well how interesting is it that we got matched up mike
6311722 you know tony im going to remember this conversation for the rest of my life i can remember dreams i had a month ago in great detail so memory isnt a problem its just that ive only had two or three other conversations like this in my life that ive been mildly interested in remembering you know that in the eleven years ive lived in this town youre the first person who kept an appointment with me most people dont want to make time for me because im old or because im single or had a stroke or walk with a cane or dont believe what they believe and i suppose thats fine because if thats how they feel then i dont have much time for them but ive really enjoyed this time and want to do it again when im done with my writing project
6311723 i thought what can i do to make my babies proud i think about what theyll think about the year they were born who i was and what i did
6311724 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a homewrecker
6311725 she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over
6311726 they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
6311727 sienna and balthazar met through friends and he was already separated from his wife
6311728 when he released a statement in july saying hed split from his wife hed been sleeping on friends couches for six months
6311729 though sienna and balt are moving really quickly everyone cant help but notice how happy they are
6311730 its nonsense that the marriage was already over when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mum in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
6311731 sienna told a few friends that balti had made some noises about moving in
6311732 then during the holiday their feelings for each other got stronger she doesnt really want to move into the family home because of all the history with his ex wife so they are planning to buy somewhere new
6311733 i hate the song its message is shameful and disgusting
6311734 she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6311735 right now shes a bit down and her weights gone up
6311736 everyone is hoping they can get things back on track
6311737 shes desperate to lose 40lb 18 kilos in time for her tour
6311738 but jermaines been stocking the fridge with pizza fried chicken chocolate and ice cream its causing friction in their relationship
6311739 she told me they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change
6311740 hes a very nice guy they were very happy and relaxed and having fun

6311742 the placenta is going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that aboriginal tribe went under that one tree it was gorgeous
6311743 if i keep spouting this deep spiritual stuff maybe movie directors will see me as more than just chick flick fodder
6311744 youre never told in our house shhh levi is sleeping no get used to the ambience come with us thats how i was raised
6311745 the nanny will tend to the crying baby while i busy myself with my bongos
6311746 everyone talked about how oh you have a kid life changes and a lot of them had an insinuation under that like you have to stop living your life as you live it thats not the case
6311747 its the best story and the best dance i ever had you have contractions and youre dancing with your partner
6311748 matthew leapt around like a wimp squealing while i squeezed his hand to breaking point
6311749 breast feeding is the best diet you can have im not out there with a trainer seven days a week but i am doing some very home styled workouts
6311750 i had a really long labour it was like 60 hours i had a blast doing it
6311751 i cannot believe that matthew let me suffer for almost three days without drugs
6311752 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
6311753 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year
6311754 she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
6311755 she gave him a three strikes and youre out ultimatum
6311756 above everything else jen is looking for stability and loyalty
6311757 shes still hurting from losing brad to angelina even after all this time
6311758 people are different people have different chemistry i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
6311759 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
6311760 theyve spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms
6311761 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
6311762 the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met
6311763 its she who ended the relationship johns childish behaviour only confirms she was right to dump him
6311764 jennifer was tired of paying for everything cobwebs come flying out of johns wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jennifer would never say anything
6311765 ya me hab a tocado algo parecido pero chivas siempre jala mucha gente por algo es el equipo m s popular y sentimos el cari o de toda la gente trabajamos bien igual no es lo ideal trabajar con tanto ruido pero trabajamos bien en el aspecto t ctico se hizo muy bien
6311766 ya estando en la cancha tratamos de olvidarnos de la banda pero pues bueno si vimos todo el ambiente que hab a en la tribuna
6311767 un poco alto pero lo tomamos como si trabajamos algo de fuerza
6311768 los hicimos pensando en santos porque tratamos de hacer un buen partido es un rival muy completo al cual no le podemos dar solamente importancia a uno debemos tener cuidado con todos adem s de las individualidades trabajan bien en equipo
6311769 muy independientemente de los resultados que obtuvimos y que no nos alcanz para disputar la final esta gira fue ben fica porque primeramente tuvimos la oportunidad de entrenar y de que tuviera participaci n la gente que no ha jugado recientemente
6311770 el simple hecho de haber salido del pa s y enfrentarnos a equipos espa oles siempre deja buenas cosas y esta vez si lo fue pues por momentos cruz azul jug bastante bien y sobre todo que agrad a la gente de all creo que realmente lo que se hizo fue bueno porque ganamos un partido en penaltis que tambi n son v lidos ya que fueron cinco tiros muy bien ejecutados y eso da un gran m rito
6311771 todos los muchachos me dejaron una grata impresi n lo cual debo reconocer que a partir de ma ana tendr dudas para empezar a armar el equipo que enfrentar el juego de este fin de semana en el torneo local todos est n aptos para jugar y la tarea de decidir la mejor opci n va a ser de uno en este par de d as que tendremos de preparaci n
6311772 fue una victoria sufrida a m xico le cost trabajo meter los goles durante el primer tiempo en donde se fallaron al menos tres goles en la primera parte
6311773 este encuento fue muy f sico hubo mucho desgaste ya que se jug con mucha velocidad el momento m s dif cil en este partido fue cuando recibimos el gol de honduras ya que fue dif cil venir de abajo pero se pudo recuperar tambi n lo m s dif cil fue preparar este primer partido por el corto tiempo que se tuvo pero hoy estoy feliz por lo que realiz esta noche el equipo y al ganar los tres puntos
6311774 yo no creo que sea un tipo con suerte yo creo que el resultado lo dio el trabajo la entrega y la capacidad de los jugadores mexicanos para ir por los dos goles ante honduras con gran actitud jugamos muy bien en la primera parte a pesar de recibir el gol tuvimos poca suerte el segundo tiempo tambi n lo hicieron bien
6311775 blanco jug muy bien vela y giovanni son dos jugadores de talento muy grande en el futbol mexicano son el presente de un futuro pero hay que trabajar con ellos pero sin duda tienen un talento enorme esperamos que para el duelo ante jamaica podamos tener una preparaci n normal con m s tiempo
6311776 sab amos que m xico buscar a aprovechar las condiciones de su local a
6311777 sab amos que m xico buscar a aprovechar las condiciones de su local a considero que antes del primer cambio o de cualquier otra situaci n nosotros comenzamos a no definir bien en el partido cuando tuvimos situaciones de contraataque para anotar
6311778 intent que los cambios funcionaran al fortalecer las bandas para jugar mejor incluso con el 1 1 pero en un bal n de rebote nos cuesta el partido nos expulsan al jugador maynor figueroa y no logramos levantarnos del golpe an mico honduras supo manejar el partido hasta el 1 1 consider que despu s de eso nos falt reacci n y control mental para superar el momento
6311779 el empate era un resultado importante para nosotros pero tuvimos una situaci n de expulsi n creo que el problema principal de nuestro pa s es la defensa pero existieron oportunidades que se estrellaron en los postes y eso habla un poco a nuestro favor ahora tenemos el partido ante canad y en 15 d as nos reunimos para este juego con la tristeza de no sumar estos puntos tenemos que pensar en alguna alternativa en la roja de mayor y en mantener la misma base que viaj ac y observar otras opciones que vienen trabajando en este proceso ma ana llegando a honduras hay que trabajar inmediatamente
6311780 hay que enfrentarlo como el rival m s dif cil
6311781 hay que enfrentarlo como el rival m s dif cil hay que enfrentarlo como el mejor santos hay que estar concentrados en hacer las cosas que sabemos hacer
6311782 en el jalisco para refrendar el buen comportamiento que tuvimos en el torneo clausura 2008 como locales empatamos algunos pero debemos pensar siempre en que vamos a ganar
6311783 nosotros estamos m s ocupados en hacer lo que sabemos que en lo que nos pueda presentar el rival queremos mejorar algunas cosas que hacemos bien y en eso estamos
6311784 ive been working on the need for this program for more than a decade mr forrest said
6311785 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6311786 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas he told abc radio
6311787 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6311788 look i honestly cant understand just where the direction is coming from at the moment mrs hull said
6311789 cancellation of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain moa ad is a painful step presidential spokeswoman lorelei fajardo said
6311790 sensitive to the objections of local christian leaders who are opposed to the agreement and that she would be seeking a new peace deal instead
6311791 she will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law set within the constitution the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6311792 i used my speech to invite the southern california water utilities to come down to queensland to have a look at our water grid and desalination plant mr beattie who recently took up the position as los angeles based trade and investment commissioner for queensland said

6311794 cemex believes the confiscation and subsequent start of the expropriation process is a flagrant violation of the constitution law of expropriation and other laws of venezuela

6311806 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6311807 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6311808 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6311809 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6311810 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6311811 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6311812 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6311813 we dont tell heroin addicts if you stay clean all week you can reward yourself by shooting up a small amount on the weekend
6311814 il sagit dun ralentissement de l conomie et non dune r cession
6311815 depuis que le bureau du ministre des affaires trang res a r pondu notre invitation de se joindre nous et a dit que nous avons de bonnes intentions nous comptons bien atteindre la bande de gaza

6311821 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
6311822 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
6311823 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east

6311838 you always fear the worst just because we didnt know exactly what it was until he was going to go in there
6311839 so i was thinking about what happened to greg last season and this year i was not upset for myself but more for this team and for this organization because we had so much momentum coming into it but it was funny when i woke up from the surgery and they told me everything was great i was really excited for a guy that just had surgery because i knew everything was still pretty much on pace

6311842 hey tell me a secret how do you keep so thin at your age
6311843 i think he wants to make sure he gets it checked out and make sure everything is all right with it
6311844 when hes been able to practice and move around hes looked awfully good to me
6311845 i think we have a number of guys that are in that category who have some soreness and my concern will be if it lingers
6311846 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going
6311847 that phrase drives me crazy especially when the user thinks they are so smart and smug they should find the person who coined it put him in a box preferably on a ratio of 1 2 seal it airtight and ask him to think outside the box
6311848 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6311849 our house shook and as soon as that happened my mother went outside to see what happened

6311853 ik vind dat hij meer respect moet tonen voor zijn tegenstanders
6311854 ik heb er geen problemen mee dat hij show verkoopt en ik begrijp dat hij door het dolle heen is na zijn zeges maar zo hoort een kampioen zich niet te gedragen
6311855 bolt moet nog volwassener worden hij zou zijn rivalen de hand moeten schudden en niet negeren maar hij zal dat nog wel leren
6311856 weird things my dad has done in the last three months
6311857 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say its none of my business
6311858 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegation of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely
6311859 how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6311860 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
6311861 as the sports sanctioning body it is nascars responsibility to monitor the garage area and ensure that the competitive playing field is level for everyone
6311862 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate postrace competitive analysis it called for a serious reaction on our part and i think the penalty speaks to that
6311863 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6311864 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rulebook and that is unacceptable
6311865 we are however disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6311866 this particular comma was rosss way of giving the men time to push back their chairs and stand
6311867 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
6311868 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible

6311873 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6311874 barack obamas own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6311875 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6311876 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here

6312076 broad and extensive changes in the project design that required extra money
6312077 the new design is good because nssf wants to utilise land optimally thats why they want to build taller towers instead of expanding the project horizontally which wastes scarce land

6312082 in most surveys coles is very competitive on price but we need to make sure that that survey is reflected in perception
6312083 in some of the other surveys customers arent quite as flattering so we need to win that price trust
6312084 i think well get improved performance from coles by getting more customers into our stores and having them buy more product
6312085 having price trust is a very important part of that
6312086 weve got to become more efficient in the way we operate the business and have to provide better products and services
6312087 were not going to ratchet up our earnings from coles as may have been done in the past by playing with the price lever

6312104 this is a festival where we swing the gods in a way we show our gratitude by serving the god for giving us all we wished for we feel happy doing this because we keep asking favors from god during our prayers

6312107 initially its a bit scary its a very nice feeling before i used to keep coming for the normal pedicure and manicure now i keep coming for this because its different its like entertainment when you see those fishes doing it
6312108 if the bush administration invests some serious diplomatic energy on courting him even half of the effort it has spent over the past year on trying to save musharraf from humiliation it can build a working relationship with nawaz this will require a carrot and stick approach the carrots will come in the form of development aid after wasting billions on the pakistani military in the past seven years the us must ensure that the majority of future aid goes to economic and civil society projects supervised not by generals but by politicians the us doesnt need to brandish a stick because thats already there in the form of the ever present threat of another military takeover

6312112 if americans had some of the issues the afghans deal with we wouldnt have been able to handle it but the afghans theyre tough
6312113 its the job of the afghan police to provide crowd control and coverage were here to assist and mentor them as necessary this is their operation and were here to support them
6312114 its great to help the afghans as much as were able to i always enjoy these types of missions it seems that the afghans dont get as much help as they need sometimes and their survival instinct kicks in too often
6312115 we need to do more of these humanitarian efforts to show the afghans their government supports them and wants them to succeed and grow

6312149 los polic as lo quisieron identificar y el muchacho sali corriendo mientras escapaba abri fuego para cubrirse los efectivos del comando lo persiguieron dos cuadras y repelieron la agresi n hasta que se meti en un pasaje y cay herido
6312150 cuando los vecinos vieron lo que hab a pasado se enardecieron con los polic as entonces lo subieron al m vil y lo llevaron al hospital pero antes se burlaron de fabricio

6312153 el rev lver lo encontraron debajo de una piedra nosotros sospechamos que lo plantaron porque los polic as volvieron a las 5 y media de la ma ana al lugar donde balearon a fabricio

6312155 the reality is that today the mac platform is relatively safe there are hundreds of thousands of viruses and other malicious software programs floating around for windows but less than 200 are known to target the mac and many of those are aimed at versions of the mac os prior to mac os x and thus have no effect on a modern mac its not that mac os x is inherently more secure against viruses than current versions of windows although it was clearly more secure than windows prior to xp sp2 the numerous vulnerabilities reported and patched in recent years are just as exploitable as their windows equivalents but most security experts agree that malicious software these days is driven by financial incentives and its far more profitable to target the most dominant platform

6312157 if the iron reacts with water then it will be locked away with other minerals and wont reach the core as metallic iron

6312171 watchdogs make it harder for politicians to stretch the truth

6312174 and there are hundreds if not thousands of bloggers who have detailed knowledge on specialized information so you really cant get away with stretching the truth anymore

6312177 qgc can increase its financial returns by supplying additional csg coal seam gas to the gladstone based plant which will have potential capacity of three liquefied natural gas lng production trains totalling up to 12 million tonnes a year of lng
6312178 the undertakings propose that bg would unwind joint marketing arrangements between bg and queensland gas company for the supply of gas to domestic wholesale customers in southern queensland
6312179 the undertakings also contemplate that bg will relinquish its current right to appoint a director to the board of qgc and restructure arrangements between bg and qgc in relation to the exchange of commercially sensitive information such that bg will not seek or obtain information in relation to the terms on which qgc supplies gas to domestic wholesale customers in southern queensland

6312216 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6312217 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6312218 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6312219 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6312220 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in

6312227 nothing remains that looks like a plane its horrific everythings burned its a horror i dont want to tell you its the most like hell ive ever seen
6312228 its been very hard emergencies of this kind leave an enormous mark on you
6312229 the problem was that after the plane crashed the area around it was engulfed in flames the firefighters could not get to the plane
6312230 that is why the helicopters came with their water tanks they were putting out the fire
6312231 from my seat i could see smoke coming up from the end of the runway there was a small mushroom cloud as you might expect after an explosion
6312232 when we came in to land the emergency services were alongside our plane as we slowed they overtook us and went straight to the crash scene they were at the scene within two minutes there must have been about 80 or 90 ambulances
6312233 i could see flames coming from the tail end of the plane it looked like the left wing was broken and the aircraft was lying on its side
6312234 the scene is devastating the fuselage is destroyed the plane burnt i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6312235 the plane was set to take off it was late on the second take off attempt there was fire in the motor of the plane which crashed very shortly after take off
6312236 todays partnering agreement secures the long term supply of ammunitions to our armed forces
6312237 the 15 year programme will ensure that the uk has a modernised sustainable munitions industry which will support british jobs and protect our capacity to produce ammunition
6312238 it is absolutely essential to the conduct of operations and training that we have a guaranteed uk based high quality source of ammunition
6312239 you can imagine that the rate of production that we are now at its been some achievement to keep that going in that period to make sure that we deliver on time
6312240 we have been working pretty closely together on georgia and issues related to afghanistan
6312241 the article he miliband wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are debates that all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in there is nothing in the article that is a problem because we have got to enter a debate with the other parties about the different futures for our country
6312242 we are getting on with the job look what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps these are the issues they want us to deal with you will see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6312243 nobody ever makes advance announcements on things like that but we are concentrating on the economic issues
6312244 they are very excited we have been watching on television it has been really exciting i dont think the british public expected that we would do so well and i think they are really delighted that we have
6312245 after 11 years of a labour government most young people are still failing to achieve five good gcses including maths and english if we are going to have a world class education system we must do more to promote educational achievement especially among the most disadvantaged children
6312246 there is a grave danger that academic study is being reserved for the high performers which will widen socio economic divides
6312247 if this were to escalate there is a very real possibility of a reversion to a system akin to the grammar secondary modern divide though arguably in less meritocratic a form
6312248 that a purportedly equalising labour government should be the architect of such a divide would be tragic irony significantly though it is all too apparent that it is the system which has lost interest in the pupils largely because they run the risk of not delivering the right a to c performance through academic gcses
6312249 the achievement gap between children from deprived backgrounds and the more affluent is closing just because a pupil is on free school meals does not mean they are destined to fail at school many schools in the most deprived areas are achieving excellent gcse results
6312250 it is ridiculous to suggest that performance tables are designed to meet government targets for example two years ago we deliberately changed the tables to include achievement in english and maths this brought about a big decline in reported performance but we made this change because it best served the needs of pupils parents and employers
6312251 maartens had a cancer battle in the past and almost had to give up the sport
6312252 its almost like a lance armstrong story hes a complete gentleman and a great ambassador for the sport and hes olympic champion now
6312253 i said to him at the end that i was really proud of him hes a really tough competitor his storys amazing and one that can inspire people what he has achieved is phenomenal
6312254 i think the leukaemia taught me to think step by step
6312255 when you are lying in a hospital bed and feeling tired you dont want to think about next month or next week you only think about the next hour
6312256 you have to be patient you lie in your bed and just wait i think thats almost the same strategy as i used here you stay in the pack be patient stay easy and wait for your chance
6312257 its only my third race so i knew i was going to be an open water novice in terms of the tactics and going straight
6312258 its really hard to go straight especially when your heads all over the place
6312259 my body had given everything i was having a real sugar low and i was swimming in zigzags and not knowing what was going on
6312260 thats where if i continue in the sport ill have to make improvements in my tactics and in my lines and having the patience to swim with people on top of you
6312261 i like to swim at the front in clear water and thats obviously the hardest way to do it because youre in the lead the whole way
6312262 this was the hardest two hours of my life its one thing to get to the top of an olympic sport or to get to the podium
6312263 but to stay focused for another four years and try to stay at the top of your sport especially in the endurance events that i do its really tough and thats probably what im most proud of at the moment that i kept at it for the last four years
6312264 i had some ups and downs along the way but this medal was completely unexpected this time last year
6312265 i was adamant i didnt want to do the sport i wanted to concentrate on swimming in the pool ive only done three races so its a bit of surprise and its a different feeling to the first one in athens
6312266 i feel more proud and more humble knowing how hard it is to get on the podium and the fact ive done it twice at two different olympic games now and in two different sports
6312267 there is virtually no competition between the london airports and the two in edinburgh and glasgow whereas under separate ownership new operators would make the most of the opportunities and generally behave as companies do in a free market
6312268 here we are today with shortage of capacity and the earliest date by which we could build a new runway at stansted is 2015 and at heathrow is 2020
6312269 baa has not been particularly adventurous and has tended to plan its investments on a sequential basis there is also very considerable criticism of the lack of responsiveness by baa to airlines needs
6312270 the new terminal at heathrow took 22 years not because baa was slow but because the planning officials did not have a government policy against which to compare the project
6312271 my fear is that by changing the policy progress will perversely be slowed down
6312272 we need root and branch regulatory reform of the airport monopolies and i am not confident that the dft review will meet those requirements
6312273 the strength of emotion amongst travellers about improvement in airports is considerable
6312274 ultimately the whole aim of competition is to introduce better service at lower price which is the opposite of what monopolies provide but it is a long process
6312275 there wont be an immediate result or any noticeable effect in the near term
6312276 i am concerned by a lot of the things i saw the goals we conceded were shocking defending
6312277 there was indecision it was schoolboy stuff we are lacking senior players in that area and it does not look like we are going to get our injured players back for the world cup games next month
6312278 we have been informed by the hong kong authorities that mr gadd was denied entry to hong kong and has returned to bangkok
6312279 mr gadd was in contact with us seeking consular assistance
6312280 i am quite famous and hard of hearing please can you arrange for an escort for me at the other end
6312281 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6312282 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6312283 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6312284 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6312285 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6312286 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6312287 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work
6312288 a bone in the throat of the american and french crusaders
6312289 we are very sorry for everybody but i feel especially sorry for william and his team as they have worked incredibly hard
6312290 it is also very disappointing to hear suggestions about our motives for racing to be abandoned there is no financial incentive for us to abandon we are here to race we want to race and in the sense that we are a not for profit organisation then the whole committee does want to race
6312291 the decision we had today was if the track was raceable on thursday and whether it was worth going through the agonies of prolonging it for another day and the possibility of racing friday and saturday you only have to look at the level of the river and the water table and the further severe weather warning we have just received for more rain in life you always have difficult decisions but this one was quite straightforward
6312292 animals and birds are lucky they dont keep acquiring things the way men do you can teach a monkey to drive a motorcycle but i have never known a monkey to go out and buy a motorcycle
6312293 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
6312294 i liken that to a biggio kind of character he played hard every day was very very competitive hed dial up the intensity when he needed to and a good guy you hate for him to be going through what hes going through
6312295 but hes an intense player hell work hard to correct something
6312296 i remember when on a friday night you were lucky to have 10 000 people in the stands if you didnt go 3 for 4 or something like that you could throw meat up into the stands and they would have devoured it i mean god it was tough to play
6312297 before playing baseball in boston was tough i mean absolutely tough i remember when there was some talk that i might be going to the yankees and stuff like that and you almost welcomed it to get out of there i loved mr yawkey but the way the atmosphere was in that town it wasnt too easy to play baseball in fenway ill tell you that it was difficult
6312298 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6312299 we wanted the win and it didnt happen we were able to blood one or two new players we had a look at some partnerships passed it quite well at times
6312300 we had one or two opportunities and youre looking to take them when they go down to 10 men theyll sit in there and thats when youve got to take your chances we certainly learnt a lot international football is not easy northern ireland came here and made it difficult for us weve still got a lot to work at but the attitude and commitment was there
6312301 it was a very solid performance we set our stall out with the shape to try to get something from the game to look forward to the world cup campaign
6312302 we have been informed by the hong kong authorities that mr gadd was denied entry to hong kong and has returned to bangkok
6312303 but putting things on the skin puts them straight into your blood stream
6312304 try to use products that are as plain as possible
6312305 the fewer ingredients the better and dont trust the labeling claims
6312306 and hopefully voters will give us a chance to improve facilities by voting in favor of a bond issue
6312307 there are still a couple of issues that were wrestling with but that 135 million figure is correct as of the end of wednesday afternoon

6312309 he had no insurance and was riding around in a private vehicle with the logo of a pizza place on top of the vehicle
6312310 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6312311 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6312312 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6312313 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6312314 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6312315 they didnt play like the same players who perform week in week out in the premier league what are we doing to them
6312316 we have one of the finest midfielders in steven gerrard he plays for liverpool and he is like roy of the rovers he shoots he scores he tackles he is not a left midfielder it is unbelievable he has to be in the centre we are killing gerrard
6312317 sometimes when the czechs counter attacked we suffered a lot and we have to repair that problem
6312318 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6312319 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6312320 arsenal are known for playing technical and skilful football and have a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6312321 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mika ls versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mika l has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6312322 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6312323 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6312324 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent

6312349 i tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote bitter slightly resinous but still pleasant the high keenig sound of the cicadas in july the feathery barrenness of the trees the very size of the sky extending white blue from horizon to horizon barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock the hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me to justify a beauty that didnt depend on the sparse spiny vegetation that often looked half dead a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills and the way they held on to the sun

6312389 the most important thing for any journalist in the world is to ensure the truth and accuracy without any fabrication or exaggeration
6312390 the two journalists are being investigated not because of their articles on corruption on pmu 18 but because they exaggerated they distorted the truth
6312391 all across the board i think the heads will be pulled in and there will be a chilling effect across the board in vietnam
6312392 and part of that chilling effect is occurring because of backlashes from the tuoi tre reports that we were just talking about and journalists their punishment attracted a good deal of sympathy from intellectuals and the elite in vietnam and i think that was distributing to the conservatives and they want to scotch this very very quickly
6312393 his death came at the time when the journalists professions particularly in tuoi tre and thanh nien news journalists were under threats by the government for pushing for opening on the current corruption case
6312394 and his death means that those kinds of journalists and people pushing for change no longer have a senior protector in vietnam

6312447 open doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odors hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6312448 one argument was that commodity prices across the globe have risen and tea has also been able to piggy back on the boom
6312449 but then why do kenyan prices lag behind those of sri lanka
6312450 we adopted a different approach to the commonest marketing text books and we continued with our differentiation strategy amidst all obstacles and high capital costs
6312451 as a result sri lankas fob price was 3 87 dollars per kilo compared with only 1 74 dollars in kenya
6312452 to the auction price was added 30 percent of value addition that was done by tea marketers
6312453 we are not only looking at volume growth but also looking at margin growth both healthy value propositions
6312454 the dollar bubble may burst but our strategy is very clear

6312465 the announcement of a third season is yet to be determined
6312466 but the july data indicated that the economy is not deteriorating rapidly
6312467 the outlook for the japanese economy essentially hinges on a recovery in the us economy oil prices are falling which is good news but i think it is still too early to predict the outlook
6312468 since last year we have been seeing a gradual slowdown in japans export growth the latest data confirmed this trend this is a reflection of the continued worsening of the global economy
6312469 rising prices of raw materials have affected the domestic demand of asian countries as well as the developed nations

6312477 are sacred to at least 13 formally recognized indian tribes and this religious significance is of centuries duration
6312478 using treated sewage effluent to make artificial snow on the most sacred mountain of southwestern indian tribes does not violate the religious freedom restoration act rfra it also holds that a supposed pleading mistake prevents the tribes from arguing under the national environmental act nepa that the forest service failed to consider the likelihood that children and others would ingest snow made from the effluent
6312479 the assistance provided is unlikely to be sufficient to ensure that many of those companies remain in business
6312480 im not angling for a move but if the opportunity arose before the transfer deadline and if something were to happen and fulham give me the green light then who knows
6312481 last season wasnt good enough for myself anybody that doesnt play week in week out is obviously going to be disappointed
6312482 but its something as a footballer as a striker you become used to strikers are probably rotated more than anybody
6312483 its always a question i cant answer it probably gets asked about 12 times a year
6312484 people say international level is a bit slower but ive scored against liechtenstein and malta ive scored against england and spain there are all sorts of different defenders
6312485 the manner of the negotiations doesnt surprise me because i know how much the president appreciated sheva how many times he said he tried to bring him back to milan and now hes succeeded
6312486 we are close to the end of the deal and i hope that these little things that have to be fulfilled are done as soon as possible
6312487 i would be extremely delighted if shevchenko returns to milan and i am ready to embrace the ukraine champion again for us its about a return home
6312488 is it a problem for players returning we have become used to confronting the challenges sometimes everything has gone well other times not so well
6312489 it depends on the motivation the players have when they come here however milan never has had a problem managing their players
6312490 at any rate in general it is not certain that shevchenko will come and it is not certain that the market will be closed if shevchenko arrives
6312491 friendlies are a bit different but it was good to be playing centre back it was only my second time for northern ireland
6312492 we were here to do a job and its a good platform to take into the qualifiers going away from home and keeping a clean sheet if that was a qualifying match we would have got a valuable point
6312493 you always get the work rate with northern ireland but with that system we worked really really hard
6312494 with david healy playing up on his own he worked his socks off i dont think he has that much match fitness so it was a credit to him
6312495 its unfortunate he missed the penalty but he has got that many goals for northern ireland i dont think it matters
6312496 we have got to give them respect but we must go into their backyard like we did in scotlands and perform like we did
6312497 if we do that we can get a good result there is a lot of hard work to be done we got turned over in latvia and iceland by these supposedly smaller nations
6312498 if we get four to six points away from home in the next qualifiers i will be very happy as long as we keep our home form
6312499 looking at the team today it should stand us in good stead for the next couple of weeks with the players we have we are capable of playing like that next month
6312500 its the way the players want to play if we can play like that in the next two games we are capable of getting something out of them
6312501 the first half was very good we got to grips with the game in the first 15 minutes but i really thought the 30 minutes before half time was very good
6312502 we played some good football and held control of the ball very well but the conditions in the second half completely ruined the game
6312503 i think we would have kicked on we were in control of the game and we could have scored a couple more
6312504 the pitch absolutely spoiled the second half but we will take the positives from the first half
6312505 we will remember the first half and try to completely forget the second half
6312506 hes a good holding midfielder but hes also always looking for that threaded pass for the strikers which is very good he did that a lot of times in the first half
6312507 injuries have ripped the heart out of what we have been doing
6312508 we had been working on a system that was looking good but then we have had bad injuries to james collins danny gabbidon and lewin nyatanga and we have got to virtually start again
6312509 we do not have too many alternatives the system we had planned and worked on is now giving us problems
6312510 we have had a bad day at the office on two fronts i am very disappointed with the manner of the defeat and the goals we conceded were just schoolboy mistakes
6312511 in the first half we played some very good football and could have been further in the lead
6312512 our football certainly deserved more of a reward but we lacked a cutting edge in the second period
6312513 that second half was a very different story and you could see it coming in the end
6312514 we were in trouble almost from the first minute after the break
6312515 and the goals we conceded were shocking defending there was indecision it was schoolboy stuff
6312516 we produced very little up front and we were being out numbered in vital areas the game looked to be petering out until that very poor goal we conceded in injury time
6312517 you cannot make that kind of mistake at this level you will be punished there was indecision people were arriving late at the situation and there was hesitancy
6312518 i am concerned by a lot of the things i saw i did not enjoy watching those goals go in the centre of our defence gave us a lot of problems it is becoming a major problem
6312519 now that ive won my first cap obviously i would like to be part of the qualifiers
6312520 i have trained well with the squad and made a little impact against northern ireland so all i can do is hope to get another call up
6312521 i dont know if this will be my last call up you never know but hopefully i will keep playing well for derby and i will be able to show the scottish fans a few more touches
6312522 there are still a lot of quality players to come back in and there are already a lot of good players here so i hope we can get to the world cup finals
6312523 it was very surreal hampden was super there was a great atmosphere and northern ireland brought a few fans which made it even better
6312524 seven days ago i wouldnt even have imagined getting into the side so this is a bit of a dream
6312525 i got pulled into the office and told i was being included in the scotland squad so its been a whirlwind

6312528 vanuit economisch oogpunt was er ook alles voor te zeggen om de aftrekbaarheid te be indigen
6312529 fiscaal is het namelijk niet erg effici nt huiseigenaars op deze manier te bevoordelen
6312530 door de hypotheekrente aftrekbaar te maken drijf je de huizenprijzen alleen maar op het was heel verstandig van de regering om er een einde aan te maken stel je voor dat de hypotheekrente hier nog steeds aftrekbaar was dan zou de woningmarkt nog veel meer oververhit zijn dan nu
6312531 niet alleen gingen de rentetarieven fors omhoog maar ook kreeg de financi le sector flinke klappen te verduren de huizenprijzen zakten in en veel huiseigenaren met hoge hypotheken konden niet meer aan hun verplichtingen voldoen

6312536 one punch conceded thats the lowest ive ever had for an opponent he played into my hands i wanted to close him down as soon as the bell went he came straight at me
6312537 in the zone i am pretty strong he stayed in and traded with me there was only going to be one winner when he did that
6312538 one of the key things to me after chicago was enjoyment i was boxing a style that didnt suit me im not really a european style boxer i like to fight i like to get stuck in sometimes amateur boxing doesnt reward that
6312539 i said i would rather go out my own way and if i dont qualify well i am doing something i enjoy the guys worked with that style which is different from the other guys but it works for me
6312540 was it destiny or fate that made me the man that i am today a man destined to go on and do great things in the world of boxing who has already achieved more than most do in a lifetime
6312541 the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us

6312551 bij deze vorm van beleggen verkeren veel klanten nog steeds in de veronderstelling dat zij een vrij risicoloze spaarvorm hebben gekozen als gevolg van de verborgen kosten die van de premie inleg worden ingehouden heeft de deelnemer ook bij deze polissen vrijwel geen schijn van kans om een fatsoenlijk rendement te maken
6312552 het betreft hier polissen die de verzekeringsnemer niet zou hebben afgesloten wanneer hij vooraf zou zijn ge nformeerd over de kosten

6312562 degenen die de regels noodgedwongen aan de kant schuiven en een gewone hypotheek afsluiten hebben het daar geestelijk vaak erg moeilijk mee
6312563 voor het vangen van rente hoeft de gemiddelde hypotheeknemer amper prestatie te leveren verstrekkers van halal hypotheken moeten meer moeite doen om winst te maken en lopen daarbij de nodige risicos een klant zou bijvoorbeeld van gedachten kunnen veranderen terwijl het huis al voor hem gekocht is dan is de strop voor de financier

6312572 i think well get improved performance from coles by getting more customers into our stores and having them buy more product
6312573 having price trust is a very important part of that
6312574 weve got to become more efficient in the way we operate the business and have to provide better products and services
6312575 were not going to ratchet up our earnings from coles as may have been done in the past by playing with the price lever
6312576 youve had high fuel prices an increase in the interest rates people see their superannuation returns are down and a reduction in house prices theyve all impacted confidence
6312577 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6312578 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6312579 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6312580 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6312581 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6312582 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6312583 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6312584 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6312585 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6312586 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6312587 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6312588 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6312589 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6312590 in history there have only been two successful fashion dolls barbie and bratz and mr larian and mr bryant stole one of those
6312591 the numbers are what they are and the law says when you profit by taking someone elses confidential information you have to give it back
6312592 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6312593 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector

6312595 sen brownback addressing the republican national convention during the highlight evening of the week is a real tribute to his leadership not only for the republican party but for every american
6312596 sen brownbacks record of leadership on numerous national and global issues fits in well with the thursday evening theme that will highlight sen mccains vision of america in pursuit of peace and an america that can be seen as a beacon of goodwill and hope throughout the world
6312597 mccain is the republican maverick and giuliani comes from that brand as well
6312598 it may bring people to the republican party who arent comfortable with obama
6312599 this prominent speaking position means that bobby jindal has arrived as a republican to be reckoned with in terms of national elections for the foreseeable future

6312604 it seems that the court is using africa as a test case to determine in what way international law can obtain more legitimacy on the ground in africa
6312605 the icc focuses on economically weak and politically vulnerable countries and on nations that are not able or willing to try perpetrators of crimes against humanity many african countries fulfill these criteria
6312606 we need to ask ourselves whether retribution is a sufficient deterrent to those who violate human rights is intervention by the icc enough to stop crimes against humanity and war crimes in africa and elsewhere in the world
6312607 the court should hold all tyrants accountable but this is not happening so far most of the indictees are african the powerful the united states instance will never be put on trial
6312608 russia will probably not be tried for what is happening in georgia and the same counts for china
6312609 should we prosecute mugabe despite the possibility this could increase the chance of further deterioration of the situation in zimbabwe or should we give him the chance to walk off if this would contribute a more stabile peace situation
6312610 i am not too much against the former if this will bring peace and stability to zimbabwe
6312611 the icc is not an experiment the court is permanent and is here to stay and does not treat any part of the world as a test case
6312612 the fact is that africa played an incredible role in the establishment of the court
6312613 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding mou and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of zanu pf s unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6312614 the mou makes it clear that no party shall take any decision or measure that has a bearing on the dialogue save by consensus such a decision or measure includes but is not restricted to the convening of parliament or formation of a new government in the present case the mdc has not consented to the convening of parliament
6312615 there is a feeling of uncertainty our worst fears are that mugabe would manipulate the situation

6312642 but when you look at him at his frame and at the articulation of his limbs as he devours the track you might be forgiven for believing that he more than any leading sprinter for several generations might just be able to achieve such feats without artificial assistance he looks balanced and natural well we can hope

6312646 there will remain in the world only two great powers capable of confronting each other the united states and soviet russia
6312647 the laws of both history and geography will compel these two powers to a trial of strength either military or in the fields of economics and ideology these same laws make it inevitable that both powers should become enemies of europe and it is equally certain that both these powers will sooner or later find it desirable to seek the support of the sole surviving great nation in europe the german people

6312651 the poll shows how wrong the washington conventional wisdom has been on this race
6312652 international crises such as iran or russia and the nation of georgia
6312653 whatever momentum obama took into the summer he really appears to have lost
6312654 its as if his campaign has stalled a little bit or coasted
6312655 for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6312656 were going to come out of our convention even more unified than we are right now ready to take on john mccain in the fall
6312657 i honestly dont feel that obama has been in politics long enough to be running our country
6312658 the hillary clinton campaign may be over but the clinton factor remains very much a part of the election
6312659 do we still have work to do with folks who supported hillary clinton absolutely but weve been able to make great strides
6312660 theyve already voted once against barack obama and right now after three months of 20 20 hindsight theyre still not voting for barack obama

6312664 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6312665 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6312666 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6312667 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6312668 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6312669 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6312670 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6312671 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6312672 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6312673 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6312674 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6312675 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6312676 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6312677 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6312678 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6312679 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6312680 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6312681 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6312682 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6312683 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6312684 also you feel powerless because the airline doesnt provide any information at all
6312685 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6312686 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6312687 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6312688 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6312689 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6312690 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6312691 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6312692 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6312693 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6312694 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6312695 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6312696 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6312697 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6312698 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6312699 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6312709 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6312710 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6312711 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6312712 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6312713 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6312714 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6312715 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6312716 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6312717 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6312718 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6312719 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6312720 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6312721 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6312722 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6312723 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6312724 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6312725 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6312726 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6312727 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6312728 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6312729 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6312730 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6312731 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6312732 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6312733 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6312734 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6312735 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6312736 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6312737 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6312738 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6312739 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6312740 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6312741 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6312742 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6312743 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6312744 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6312745 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6312746 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6312747 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6312748 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6312749 the major advantage is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6312750 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6312751 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6312752 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days

6312761 lovinsky pierre antoine graduated in psychology from the haitian state university and obtained further specialisation on child psychology in montreal canada he has been involved for several years as a grass roots community organizer mainly working with children in the early 1990s he co founded the foundation for the support of children fondsayon kore timoun yo for young street children in port au prince and a centre for teenage mothers foyer pour m res adolescentes
6312762 i know it was a difficult decision for lovinsky because he knew the risks and he had a family that he loved but in the end lovinsky felt he could not stay out of haiti any longer that he was needed to help organize progressive grassroots voices in haiti
6312763 i last saw lovinsky in person in february 2007 at the time he was receiving threats and frequently changing where he slept he knew he was in danger but also knew that in haitis democratic transition that the traditional forces would have the upper hand he knew that if the people did not organize life would become more difficult for the majority of haitians who are poor
6312764 i have not heard of any report from any haitian authorities on lovinskys disappearance despite requests from lovinskys family fondasyon trant septanm members of the u s congress and human rights and haiti solidarity activists from around the world
6312765 we also know that the police have repeatedly failed to follow up on leads they have been provided it is hard to escape the conclusion that the haitian government is not reporting on its investigation because it is not conducting one
6312766 calling for the authorities to ensure wilson mesiliens protection in accordance with his wishes
6312767 i cannot explain why lovinsky was left out of the working groups report the un mission in haiti issued a press release about it the abduction was in the news amnesty international and other human rights groups issued action alerts the omission was especially troubling because lovinsky was such a high profile human rights activist and candidate for the senate elections
6312768 while i was president from 1995 97 i made 661 local phone calls 264 long distant ones and 24 internationally a total of 949 telephone calls also i sent 216 fax messages 179 letters 1000 printed invitations and five internal newsletters
6312769 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6312770 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6312771 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6312772 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6312773 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6312774 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6312775 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6312776 who are open to doing something on the production side
6312777 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6312778 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6312779 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6312780 households worried about the high cost of keeping warm this winter will draw little comfort from the farmers almanac which predicts below average temperatures for most of the u s
6312781 the almanacs winter forecast is at odds with that of the national weather service whose trends based outlook calls for warmer than normal temperatures over much of the country including alaska said ed olenic chief of the operations branch at noaas climate prediction center
6312782 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
6312783 were gettin some heavy early snow and some single digit temps in january for sure
6312784 the link between cancer and environmental factors such as pollution and pesticides is not strong with scientists believing these factors contribute to only about two percent of cancers diagnosed
6312785 more than half of those surveyed are also concerned about the link between stress and cancer but there is no conclusive evidence linking cancer and stress
6312786 what is surprising is that only a quarter of people surveyed highlighted uv radiation as a cause of cancer many are more inclined to believe myths than reality when it comes to what causes cancer
6312787 there are many causes of cancer that we do know about such as tobacco use sun exposure genetic risk factors and diet and lifestyle
6312788 we found that in all their training junior doctors learn about diseases and symptoms and what drugs to prescribe but they werent really taught about how to tailor those to individual patients such as dosage and frequency and this is where most errors occur
6312789 it really was a case of the pen being mightier than the scalpel we dont let junior doctors operate on patients by themselves but we were letting them prescribe medication without proper training
6312790 we developed a safe prescribing training programme that has been part of the training for all final year medical students at uq since 2006 parts of our programme have also been adopted by the national prescribing service
6312791 we also developed a standardised medication chart that has been adopted by queensland health and implemented across all of its 108 facilities across the state as well as being rolled out nationally
6312792 no other country in the world has such a system of standardised charts and we are hoping to share our work around the world
6312793 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6312794 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6312795 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6312796 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6312797 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it

6312803 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
6312804 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6312805 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
6312806 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6312807 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognised a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women

6312816 double olympic champion and double world record holder at 21
6312817 aye ive been saying all season to everybody that the 200 means a lot more to me than the 100 metres
6312818 it was different with the 100 because i had that record already so all i wanted to do was win
6312819 so it means a lot to me but also the country also i just talked to the prime minister and he told me everywhere in jamaica is blocked off everyone is in the streets ive written history pretty much so im happy with myself real proud
6312820 right now i just want to chill out go to sleep i wish i was in sandals right now the popular resort in jamaica just taking a weekend but ive got one more to go in the 4x100 relay and i know the guys are also looking forward to it so im just trying to refocus again to get one more gold medal
6312821 well a lot of people compare me to michael johnson but i dont compare myself a lot to other people i try to be just me myself but i dont want to say anything too serious about the 400 because my coach may want to get me to run one but anything is possible if i put my mind to it to work hard like i did this season all im looking forward to is going to bed and getting up in the morning to let it soak in im a double gold medallist dont hold your breath because i dont think ill be going up to the 400 any time soon
6312822 well im lightning bolt im not flash gordon or anybody

6312830 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6312831 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6312832 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans
6312833 ideally we would label therapeutic cells with our cellular mri agents before they are implanted into a patient in this way we could use mri to visualize the movement of the therapeutic cells in the patient to monitor whether they migrate to and remain in the desired tissues

6312967 you are caught in the vicious cycle you are hesitant because you are not used for things going your way and things will never go your way because you remain hesitant you see what you want become hesitant and the door of opportunity closes it happens again and again and again with each choice towards inaction you reject yourself a little bit more
6312968 this is where that cycle of hesitation leads in your world of hesitation you shred off more and more of your manliness until you turn into a full fledged nice guy then you seek to remove hesitation by making the approach
6312969 if there is a choice between less pain or the possibility of more pain we default to the less pain in adolescence going for a girl and failing made you think everyone else would laugh at you whether or not it was true you thought it was true this was how you were kept within the cycle
6312970 by realizing that the choice of inaction is more painful than action childhood is over you are the man you must approach always default to action now from those of us who wasted years in that hesitation mode know that rejection is always better than regret always
6312971 they do not know how great you are you are beautiful lovely enchanting dazzling in every way and they are idiots when they cannot see it
6312972 let me tell you more of my problems with men
6312973 i thought that through friendship love would eventually spring how wrong i was a friend she sees a friend you be
6312974 but why pook why is friendship hopeless i fall in love with my female friends do they not do the same
6312975 oh woman pray tell why do you not go after your male friends
6312976 yes my male friends constantly fall in love with me
6312977 and speak truly madam what do you and your male friends do
6312978 why it is a difference between the sexes young man what do you do with your friends
6312979 but do you and your guy friends ever sit around and talk about your feelings and things going on in your life
6312980 there is your answer men do not get together and just talk we do things when we are with our women friends we talk much more since we reserve our talking sharing emotions and experiences to our romantic interest we get confused with our female friends we begin to get interested in them because of this
6312981 women usually arent used to getting together and doing pure action so when they do so with their guy friends they get a bit confused as well
6312982 so avoid the friendship route when you see a woman you are interested in go for her romantically for a friend she sees a friend you shall always be
6312983 it is all women mother nature herself this nasty sphinx devours all hearts and lives of those who cannot answer her riddle that man in the picture he figured out the riddle to woman thus he became known as don juan
6312984 is that there is no riddle woman is a sphinx with no secret it is only our minds that we assign her secrets mysteries pedestals and goddess like status
6312985 look at the above example look at how the lad got stood up over and over and yet over and over he rationalized the standing up how often is it that a lad rationalizes signals to his liking how often is it that a lad offers gifts and treasures as sacrifices to her goddess likeness for in his mind she is a goddess how often is it that a lads overactive imagination converts her disrespect her shallowness her flaws into love
6312986 exactly judge by her actions and not by her words judge by what she does than by what your mind wants to see our vanity will convert the image of every disinterested girl into secretly loving us for women tell us what we want to hear this is why we must judge by her actions and not by her words
6312987 i will be patient and let the cards fall where they may
6312988 how can patience be confidence isnt confidence courage isnt confidence action how is patience courageous or action
6312989 now let us summon up a don juan and observe his mannerisms
6312990 hear me oh don juan there are women around and other men are hitting on them what is your reaction
6312991 these other guys are going to take his women how can he be so laid back
6312992 he is laid back because he knows how great a catch he is and that getting women is easy he knows he is the prince
6312993 i should have kissed her i have been following philosophies and not being myself i should follow my inner nature and
6312994 why the food is right in front of him his nose smells it his eyes see it he drools
6312995 and so is the same with women what does the kid do next
6312996 his senses all tell him to do so he knows when to eat because the food has been all prepared has been cooked and is presented before him
6312997 and so is it the same with women they have been prepared through decades of aging and growth for this purpose they dream it they want it oh heavens do they want it they have been warmed through your fun through your attention through their desire through your desire they are presented through themselves do you think she is wearing what she does for herself no she is wearing it for you women are not ornaments to be admired they are there to be consumed you know it they know it
6312998 nature has a system in place no philosophy in the world can do you any good the philosophies that supposedly work are the ones that best match natures music you either can flow with the system and get what you want or you can buck it in pain so listen to that gut
6312999 it is because they dont know how good you are
6313000 the only constant is i what if it is something i keep doing
6313001 why am i acting like a beggar i am smart handsome have a future and women ought to work to get me
6313002 goody that means i get to be passive to continue to indulge in my vaporous habits and not do a thing to alter myself i like to hear that because it means i am perfect as i am and ought not change for anyone
6313003 foolish youth if you are not changed by life then you are not living life only those who are not altered by life are those totally unaware of it
6313004 before us are two youths who are on the threshold of life both have the same origins yet the destinations are different let us look at the first one
6313005 i cherished her i bought her flowers everyday i sang her sonnets i always told her i loved her
6313006 he was after all just being himself now for the second young man
6313007 that they are stuck in a type of stasis i have changed they acknowledge that but they are exactly the same
6313008 the second one is always getting better the first one is always staying the same if not getting worse
6313009 exactly it is the difference between rotting and ripening be the good fruit be the prize to be won
6313010 i need to do this and this at work today it would be wonderful if you would go get the supplies for me
6313011 by pleasing her whims i lost track of mine a servant youll be a friend shell see as
6313012 im not equipped to answer such a question let us ask a great philosopher
6313013 attention socrates you have been summoned did you know that answer the question that is respect
6313014 thats an easy one pook where there is reverence there is fear but there is not reverence everywhere that there is fear because fear presumably has a wider extension than reverence
6313015 oh wise sage salient soul respect is the realization of set boundaries after all how can reverence become without any sense of fear of you walking away for true passion with women can only come when the man can easily walk away the great catch walking away is womans great fear
6313016 yes now let us ask a question to that opposite sex arise woman
6313017 answer this riddle why do men who are willing to walk away turn you on
6313018 didnt everyone know this a man that can walk away means that he has his pick of the litter and the woman can easily be replaced you wont find the lawyer or doctor or politician be entangled to a woman at first
6313019 so the great catch is always willing to walk away
6313020 the great catch is respect she is supposed to celebrate life with you not use you as a peon be a man and respect attends to itself
6313021 are entirely sexual creatures they do not respond to your intellectualism they do not respond to your genius they only respond to sexuality
6313022 most men are scared of their sexuality look at the chumps they are not men they are androgynous they are ape like
6313023 the woman has invited the nice guy to her pleasure palace
6313024 why he is not being male he is not being what he is enough
6313025 here the nice guy is leeching off the woman in a pathetic friendship way
6313026 what mr nice guy no way he could never have a penis
6313027 what do you want a relationship with a girl to be about
6313028 do you want to talk about dna or genetics all day
6313029 then stop talking to her about dna and genetics stop talking to her about geek things you do not need another lab partner
6313030 then embrace your own sexuality be a guy talk like a guy act like a guy do action things it is one thing to talk about things you love but most guys talk about things just to talk
6313031 sexualize myself my appearance and my actions and the women will naturally follow
6313032 when you have that connection with someone that warm safe and comfortable feeling right there then what sometimes can happen is
6313033 guides you shall learn and memorize the booklets of societal situations with women
6313034 thou shall never stay on the phone longer than twenty minutes
6313035 these guides and rules were a clutch for my lack of confidence they do however work but are overall limited
6313036 the rules and guides are the training wheels the helper out of the nest
6313037 if the rules and guides were successful why would he abandon them
6313038 because he realized he was successful not by the rules and guides but by the approaching and fun mindset the rules and guides demanded
6313039 nothing but it is critical to realize the purpose of scripts and guides
6313040 the point of manual is not to grant you success if you do you will forever be under his dictatorship the entire reason why manual exists is to not grant you success but illustrate the means of success
6313041 meaning that a few people became successful and formed manual out from the clay of their knowledge manual is their automaton their robot to consistently answer newbies questions the end goal in seduction in success is to make it natura l when it becomes natural you have no need for manual and can handle anything women throw at you
6313042 i used to think women were nice and charming that only bad boys were the problem this knowledge is shattering every ideal i held about women
6313043 but i am myself i will never change for anybody
6313044 you do not have muscles what makes you think you can get hot women
6313045 you are not that smart why do you think you can get the pick of the group
6313046 you do not have a high paying job why do you think you deserve a hottie
6313047 you are not as cute or handsome as the other guys therefore you do not deserve a hot chick
6313048 and so long as you think so long you remain free
6313049 but pook what are you a self improvement seminar where is the woman in this
6313050 women come and go but you are forever the focus must be on you what do you want in a girl what do you want to do for a date what type of relationship are you looking for it is a machine to the one you push the button and out she comes
6313051 but pook what if she does not like your date ideas what if she is different from what you are looking for
6313052 then she is not for you the thing girls hate is when you cannot have a date idea which happens to guys because they want to please her without thinking of themselves you have a series of hobbies and tastes if she likes your date ideas then that is good if she doesnt then go get another girl there are billions out there
6313053 only if you place the focus on the woman if you do that then you actually believe it is women who are making the choice not you there is no rejection you are merely finding out if she has good taste after all she is looking for a guy that fits her interests and tastes if she doesnt like you for whatever reason let her and thank her for doing so
6313054 which would you prefer a woman who collapses her own interests for the sakes of yours merely to have a boyfriend or a woman who likes you because of you
6313055 indeed now think back to your nice guy days those suffering days of endless agreement and non confrontation what service did you do to help find compatibility
6313056 look into the valley look at how man has fallen
6313057 everything would be much simpler if they werent female and would logically make sense
6313058 indeed they are not just female but so annoyingly female
6313059 what you are still single oh poor guy you will one day progress and get a chick like us
6313060 i just got a new girlfriend and you are still single hah
6313061 we all are married or have girlfriends but you poor chap are still single
6313062 give the woman flowers chocolate poetry declarations of love your full attention your promises your exclusiveness your time your dreams your life and adopt her desires her plans her manipulations and her designs on your future
6313063 most guys still think like women they think that by sleeping with lots of women by having a girlfriend or by having a wife means they are successful with women
6313064 you mean that beggars cant be choosers you mean for guys to pick the girl rather than the other way around
6313065 youre closer and that is true but women date for all sorts of reasons they marry for all sorts of reasons they sleep with you for all sorts of reasons to the addition of the above you want to find a woman that is interested in you
6313066 oh poor thing you will get a girl like me one day
6313067 the error is guys defining their success on having a woman or women they should rather be concerned with having a woman that does actually like them
6313068 why do you say this pook it sounds like a bit more work
6313069 yes but if you do this then you wont be like the following
6313070 she said she loved me and we got married why does she want a divorce now
6313071 all my friends thought she was a keeper so why is she cheating on me with her ex
6313072 she wont return my repeated calls what is going on
6313073 i do her date ideas and she thought i was boring what does that mean
6313074 when you aim at something long term you need to make sure the woman like you just because she dates you sleeps with you and yes even marries you does not mean she likes you
6313075 you define what the dates are at first she will work with you if she likes you you can soften up later like in a couple of months if she starts breaking dates giving you the run around or seems inflexible then that should be warning signs that she doesnt like you
6313076 i see but what if youre so awful at djing that no woman likes you
6313077 then youll have more free time with your buddies success cannot be getting a girl because that means failure is being alone no failure is being in an unhappy marriage or a relationship where she has no true interest in you
6313078 so the focus must be on you including her interest
6313079 right drop the getting a girl is success mantra and you will never be dumped
6313080 what are you cruel voice your words like daggers in my heart
6313081 then you are not valiant for you fear the pointed tip like a soft worm i am you your inner self your own imagination and if you like soul by caging me your successes with women will spike with increasing frustration
6313082 what you are the one that is spreading this emptiness through my body like a virus
6313083 you craven dismal dreaming miscreant you know you are now getting what you desired women so why are you so unhappy
6313084 but i had to change because i wasnt getting the women
6313085 and you failed because by keeping me caged you limit yourself
6313086 indeed like a heaven over us the ladies in womaniverse watch us over yes they always notice you they look at your life and reward the men of the world with the feminine element
6313087 oh no some get virgin material while the fools get common ore
6313088 what else can you tell me of this feminine element
6313089 it is highly relaxing very ornamental in sports cars explodes and freezes for no reason and reacts well to gold platinum or any of the precious metals it also turns green when placed near superior specimens
6313090 what are you saying pook that how we are the rock in their world that they are the rock an element of ballast for us in this universe
6313091 oh silly youth these thoughts are too feathery and fluff at nothingness in your dimension dont think of it only read the letter
6313092 rarely usually women speak in so we men dont hear anything anyway but being a dutiful pook an emissary myself i have translated the letter to masculine terms
6313093 thank heavens now i see why its in 19th century style
6313094 look at me i am the object and axis of your world my whims become your laws what you enjoy today including your tastes in food women and cars will be dictated by me i alone will frame the world you live
6313095 because it was the truth why do you let people mold and shape your life your life is going in circles because you cannot tear yourself from your loser friends or stupid entertainment keep reading the letter
6313096 if one day you actually get the chance to enter womaniverse youll be even more amazed
6313097 is to unite your dream and day it is the only way
6313098 this is the most sexist thing i have ever heard
6313099 you doubtful youth you are a beanstalk cynic a crusty philosopher
6313100 look when we were young we all desired to grow up now once grown up we desire to be young again being poor you trade your time and health for money only to use that money for time and health we have all passed through the world of a child
6313101 are you saying that i ought to be child like
6313102 yes young kids lacking the chemical madness curse that puberty brings us are at perfect ease and treat the sexes appropriately no young boys will say whatever you want to do young boys run around they do not sit and talk to the girl all night young boys have their cars their trucks their dangers and excitements now compare the young boys actions to those who are really successful with women
6313103 they are identical i always thought women were immature for going after these so called jerks bad boys and jocks i see that in some ways they are immature but they kept that joy of youth with them whereas i had killed it
6313104 why i speak to her about philosophy about literature about the designs on the universe about dna about world events about
6313105 stop i can take no more come and drink from this fountain of youth
6313106 true wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life ourselves and the world around us
6313107 ill do the whole packet at the end of the week

6313138 the taliban increased their terroristic activity on their part and the u s will prevail in the end

6313140 when we get hit its our afghan brothers checking on us and are genuine about caring for us

6313143 we have no choice but to depend on each other
6313144 it is an event where the words of hillary clinton are probably going to be exceptionally important
6313145 dies ist ein kleiner schritt f r einen menschen ein gro er schritt f r die menschheit
6313146 i represent a private firm sir and can help you with all of this
6313147 your wife said you are not sitting together let me take care of it
6313148 it will have an adverse effect on the global investment climate in the city
6313149 i can understand the outrage of those whose mother tongue is hindi
6313150 is it not written in your law i have said you are gods
6313151 these are my eyes as i had eyes on the earth but if you were to see me in heaven i have eyes blue like revelation eyes like fire these are my human eyes not my god eyes
6313152 i am beholding the glory and this is the lord himself
6313153 if you pass me right now you will die todd you are not just having a vision you are in heaven and this is real
6313154 i am the gate i am the door i am the ladder there is no heaven without me
6313155 since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses
6313156 therefore we also since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily ensnares us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us
6313157 then last of all he was seen by me also as by one born out of due time
6313158 todd i want to share with you how i received the revelation of the gospel and i want to share with you some of the encounters that i had in the third heaven
6313159 but i make known to you brethren that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man for i neither received it from man nor was i taught it but it came through the revelation of jesus christ
6313160 do you want to know when that gal 1 11 12 happened
6313161 it is doubtless not profitable for me to boast i will come to visions and revelations of the lord i know a man in christ who fourteen years ago whether in the body i do not know or whether out of the body i do not know god knows such a one was caught up to the third heaven and i know such a man whether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows how he was caught up into paradise and heard inexpressible words which it is not lawful for a man to utter
6313162 jesus christ was with me when i was here in heaven and he shared the revelation of the gospel himself
6313163 when i got saved i did not talk with flesh and blood and not one single man taught me
6313164 abraham taught me in heaven and thats how and why i wrote the book of hebrews what i heard was from the lips of abraham himself
6313165 do you know why i know so much about abraham
6313166 abraham himself shared information with me and i simply wrote it
6313167 the authorship isnt clear because it was abraham and i abraham shared with me
6313168 when i was in the third heaven abraham was with me like you are with me now
6313169 i was never just only a preacher of the gospel and i was never just a man of the gospel and salvation i was a prophet of visions and revelations i was a man of prophetic encounters and prophetic experiences i was a man of the open heavens i was a man that believed in the revelatory gift of the spirit of god searching the deep things of god and revealing it to me we have the mind of christ
6313170 todd never just be an apostle or just do signs and wonders

6313179 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner

6313197 i had a really long labour it was like 60 hours i had a blast doing it
6313198 i cannot believe that matthew let me suffer for almost three days without drugs
6313199 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6313200 right now shes a bit down and her weights gone up
6313201 everyone is hoping they can get things back on track
6313202 shes desperate to lose 40lb 18 kilos in time for her tour
6313203 but jermaines been stocking the fridge with pizza fried chicken chocolate and ice cream its causing friction in their relationship
6313204 she told me they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change
6313205 hes a very nice guy they were very happy and relaxed and having fun
6313206 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6313207 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
6313208 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year
6313209 she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
6313210 she gave him a three strikes and youre out ultimatum
6313211 above everything else jen is looking for stability and loyalty
6313212 shes still hurting from losing brad to angelina even after all this time
6313213 people are different people have different chemistry i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
6313214 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
6313215 theyve spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms
6313216 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
6313217 the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met
6313218 its she who ended the relationship johns childish behaviour only confirms she was right to dump him
6313219 jennifer was tired of paying for everything cobwebs come flying out of johns wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jennifer would never say anything
6313220 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6313221 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a homewrecker
6313222 she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over
6313223 they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
6313224 sienna and balthazar met through friends and he was already separated from his wife
6313225 when he released a statement in july saying hed split from his wife hed been sleeping on friends couches for six months
6313226 though sienna and balt are moving really quickly everyone cant help but notice how happy they are
6313227 its nonsense that the marriage was already over when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mum in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
6313228 sienna told a few friends that balti had made some noises about moving in
6313229 then during the holiday their feelings for each other got stronger she doesnt really want to move into the family home because of all the history with his ex wife so they are planning to buy somewhere new
6313230 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
6313231 profile of the chemical odours linked to skin cancer may lead to a day when diagnoses can be made by waving a scanner over the skin researchers told the annual conference of the american chemical society in philadelphia pennsylvania

6313237 i used my speech to invite the southern california water utilities to come down to queensland to have a look at our water grid and desalination plant mr beattie who recently took up the position as los angeles based trade and investment commissioner for queensland said
6313238 weve got experiences skills technologies and strategies to share with californians who are battling the same water challenges as queenslanders
6313239 we are hoping hell be back on board on saturday and then things will look a bit different again
6313240 of course we are lacking the presence on the pitch of these kinds of people which in itself commands respect from opponents
6313241 but thats the way it is and we make the best of all situations
6313242 we werent pressing the opposition enough and we have to be more physical and prevent the crosses coming in
6313243 totally unwilling to accept that a budget cant be done by labor day
6313244 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6313245 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6313246 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6313247 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6313248 both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in iraq
6313249 been law for eight years now and taxpayers are used to those rates
6313250 allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase
6313251 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6313252 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6313253 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6313254 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6313255 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6313256 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6313257 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6313258 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6313259 its going to be a long time coming out of this

6313268 its going to take a while for it to sink in but its a proud moment for me
6313269 i like swimming from the front but the final section was a blur

6313286 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
6313287 ive been working on the need for this program for more than a decade mr forrest said
6313288 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6313289 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas he told abc radio
6313290 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6313291 look i honestly cant understand just where the direction is coming from at the moment mrs hull said
6313292 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and im you know i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and etc that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6313293 i used my speech to invite the southern california water utilities to come down to queensland to have a look at our water grid and desalination plant mr beattie who recently took up the position as los angeles based trade and investment commissioner for queensland said

6313295 the district has been criticized for mismanaging the 2 2billion in bond funds and some promised projects have been canceled
6313296 the districts board of trustees moved earlier this year to place an additional 3 5 billion bond measure on the november ballot
6313297 that will depend on what the vets decide this afternoon
6313298 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6313299 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6313300 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6313301 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6313302 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6313303 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6313304 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6313305 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6313306 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6313307 thats a big advantage but we have to be concerned with tonight
6313308 were having trouble putting together all the facets of the game and last night we had none of them
6313309 the reason were doing that doesnt change once we get to the playoffs
6313310 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6313311 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6313312 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6313313 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6313314 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6313315 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6313316 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6313317 he probably wont be able to handle the puck or shoot the puck but he can get in all the skating drills
6313318 were really excited about him he has such a high skill level
6313319 we are deeply grateful for the dedication of all police officers in northern ireland and 75 of the allowance remains in place
6313320 the chief constable has made it clear hes never seen the level of threat as high
6313321 on the one hand the secretary of state and security minister acknowledge that threat on the other they are taking this contemptuous approach
6313322 going to berkeley auto body is like going to your cool uncle to have your car fixed
6313323 can you tell me if the car needs a tune up it sounds louder and growlier
6313324 blah blah blah blah blah copper wire blah blah blah replace
6313325 these spark plugs have never been replaced and your car is ten years old
6313326 and went on to explain in simple terms why a major tune up was a good idea he showed me so many things and explained in such detail that i was convinced it was necessary

6313332 la versione ufficiale falsa la falsit della versione ufficiale dimostrabile ed stata dimostrata
6313333 il danno non avrebbe provocato la caduta come lo dimostra il fatto che un aereo militare ha colpito lempire state building e lempire state building non caduto
6313334 la lista che stata fornita da questi due senior mossad experts includeva i nomi di quattro dei no dei dei dirottatori del 9 di sette dell11 di settembre nessuno di essi fu arrestato
6313335 possibile che non ci sia nessuno di questi nastri possibile che facciamo conto su questi 4 fotogrammi
6313336 fate le domande e datevi le risposte chiedete le risposte
6313337 quello del pentagono non cera perch non labbiamo visto abbiamo visto solo lesplosione ma quello no
6313338 s ma le torri erano state prima caricate di bombe da una societ come quella che ha fatto crollare i
6313339 e come mai sono crollate nello stesso istante in cui gli aerei sono penetrati dentro
6313340 no questo molto probabile una coincidenza che possibile perch bisogna escludere questo
6313341 noi non ceravamo le immagini sui forni crematori sono state fabbricate dallesercito americano per creare unimmagine negativa dei nemici gli ebrei erano stati tutti avvertiti di trasferirsi in israele tant che oggi il complotto israelo americano si tradotto nella nascita di uno stato di israele partecipe dellimperialismo occidentale
6313342 ma possibile che c uno che il capofila degli uomini del terrorismo internazionale che rivendica ci sono tutte le cose che abbiamo visto sui due commandos che dirottano gli aerei e vanno a infilarsi nelle torri gemelle
6313343 here were talking about plastic knives and using an american airlines flight filed with our citizens and the missile to damage this building and similar inaudible that damaged the world trade center
6313344 qui stiamo parlando di coltelli di plastica e di usare un volo american airlines pieno di nostri cittadini e il missile per danneggiare questo edificio e simile i incomprensibile che ha hanno danneggiato il world trade center
6313345 qui stiamo parlando di coltelli di plastica e di usare un volo american airlines pieno di nostri cittadini come un missile per danneggiare questo edificio e simile i incomprensibile che ha hanno danneggiato il world trade center
6313346 no io voglio guardare i fatti ma le interpretazioni non mi interessano
6313347 per noi non abbiamo limmagine dellaereo che va dentro il pentagono noi sospettiamo lo dice quel filmato noi sospettiamo che le torri gemelle siano state abbattute non da quei due aerei che casualmente sbagliando rotta quel giorno sono entrati l dentro ma sono state abbattute da dei detonatori che erano stati messi precedentemente labbiamo sentita sottolinea con enfasi una cosa di questo genere e poi il filmato che abbiamo a disposizione non ci fa vedere laereo del pentagono quindi c un grande complotto per far vedere al mondo che esistito un attentato di al qaeda che in realt non esistito e questo unoperazione che qualche servizio segreto molto potente ha dovuto mettere in opera
6313348 molti lettori patriottici mi hanno scritto per la frustrazione che provano di fronte al dibattito guidato dallisteria e dalla disinformazione dove i fatti e il senso comune non possono prevalere e mi sfidano a spiegare
6313349 mi sfidano a spiegare come mai tre edifici del world trade center si sono afflosciati sulle loro fondamenta alla velocit della caduta libera un evento incompatibile con le leggi della fisica eccetto in un caso una demolizione controllata
6313350 la storia ufficiale dell11 di settembre cos inadeguata e manipolata che devessercene per forza unaltra
6313351 io non sono antisemita conosco tante persone ebree che sono brave
6313352 e chiaro che le autorit statunitensi hanno fatto poco o nulla per impedire gli eventi del 9 di settembre
6313353 la lista che stata fornita da questi due senior mossad experts includeva i nomi di quattro dei no dei dei dirottatori del 9 di sette dell11 di settembre nessuno di essi fu arrestato
6313354 un tempo eravamo uniti adesso non lo siamo pi e bisognerebbe cercare di ricostruire quello che si rotto
6313355 voi europei continuate a inseguire le chimere le regole sono finite bisogna farne delle altre
6313356 le regole sono cambiate voi non dovete affrontare il problema noi siamo quelli che si contrappongono al terrorismo noi cambieremo le regole
6313357 one of my favorite pizza places i just wish they had more seating

6313385 they the kafiroon want to extinguish allahs light with their deceit their lies but allah will never allow this for his light will be seen even though they the kafiroon hate it for it is he who has sent his messenger to reveal the way of truth to make it triumph over all other ways even though they the mushrik n hate it
6313386 the jews and nazarenes will never be satisfied with you until they have changed your way of life
6313387 it is not for the believer man or woman when allah and his messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision for whoever disobeys allah and his messenger has indeed strayed into plain error
6313388 and whosoever does not judge by what allah has revealed such are the kafiroon
6313389 whomsoever seeks a way of life other than islam it shall not be accepted for in the life to come they shall be the ones who have lost

6313430 for us it was a hard fought three points the referee did a very solid job trying to deal with a very hard fought game
6313431 it was pure determination of the team which is necessary to win games like this one
6313432 its the time where we need to get guys back
6313433 we were going along real good and then we had a couple day stretch there where we lost a few guys

6313437 the coaches and players are starting to understand what we have personnel wise weve got a great secondary great coverage justin will be a good addition on the d line and ray mcdonald is showing hes a solid player its going to culminate in a lot of sacks
6313438 if i could go back and do it over id wait till it was 100 percent
6313439 i wasnt able to make the plays i wanted to make i dont want to write it off that i was injured but my expectations were a lot higher for last year
6313440 lets not make too much about the green bay game its preseason it was a great evaluation and thats it nobodys arrived and we all know that
6313441 i was happy with the effort but there were a lot of mistakes made we need to get a lot further
6313442 it was a blessing to play on the same defensive front as him
6313443 hes playing with good leverage and hes got very good quickness
6313444 the holes materialize to be an entry and exit saucer from a azygos bullet

6313459 we have fooled ambushed and demolished the mainstream media says martin
6313460 we are on the brink of winning a massive psychological victory against barack obama
6313461 before today people might have thought we were nuts to take on obama in denver
6313462 our denver fighting camp will function as a nerve center and clearinghouse for all of the opposition to obama pro clinton plain vanilla anti obama and so forth
6313463 my familiarity with special operations and psychological warfare provides me with the experience and insight to act as the leader without being the leader
6313464 the zogby poll is going to trigger an anti obama avalanche and that avalanche begins today in new york with the announcement of the anti obama fighting camp a candidate such as obama who is hemorrhaging support before he gets to denver is going to leave denver as a casualty not a conqueror
6313465 the committee of one million to defeat barack obama limits itself to 100 maximum contributions there are no bundlers fat cats or illegal contributions obama is opposed to everything america stands for
6313466 but while obama has raised a third of a billion dollars his opponents have raised nothing they can either contribute now or pay later if we do not succeed obama will
6313467 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6313468 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6313469 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6313471 workers are finally getting some protection we need all the support we can get for farm workers
6313472 now we are hoping we will get our pay on time we hope now we will finally get clean water the water now isnt even good enough to take showers some of us are getting sick weve never had decent water
6313473 the bad treatment by the boss we have been under a lot of pressure for example we dont have adequate housing and the water situation is bad the water is contaminated and people are getting sick the boss said he didnt have time to fix it people were getting sick
6313474 i always tell the workers dont let people treat you like you dont count
6313475 these workers were brought in later than many were this year
6313476 and expect to keep working until mid december we hope to have a contract negotiated and adopted before the end of this season
6313477 so now we will work to secure a first contract that delivers that
6313478 this marks a new era for workers and unionism in canada
6313479 we helped process over 22 million in parental benefit claims for sawp workers recently
6313480 our migrant worker centres helped over 30 000 workers last year
6313481 if the bush administration invests some serious diplomatic energy on courting him even half of the effort it has spent over the past year on trying to save musharraf from humiliation it can build a working relationship with nawaz this will require a carrot and stick approach the carrots will come in the form of development aid after wasting billions on the pakistani military in the past seven years the us must ensure that the majority of future aid goes to economic and civil society projects supervised not by generals but by politicians the us doesnt need to brandish a stick because thats already there in the form of the ever present threat of another military takeover

6313492 it was a bad time for me as i felt everyone was against me and hated me
6313493 but being alone in a place where no one knows me for almost one year did me a lot of good i spent most of my time by myself and i started believing in myself more and in god more i was living very near the beach and it helped me to shape up and gain a new perspective in life
6313494 i realized that if i want people to be happy with me then i have to be happy with myself first slowly i woke up from my nightmare and i struggled to be a better person by throwing away a lot of negative baggage kumbaga i rehabilitated myself and i really have to thank god for giving me another chance he really helped me change

6313498 the nab has made a very good start today they made a public commitment to officially reduce rates if official rates are cut
6313499 this decision by the nab now throws down the challenge to all the other banks
6313500 other banks should have a good hard look at themselves and look at what the nab has done
6313501 we know that banks have had to pay more for money over the last six to eight months as a result of the global liquidity crisis

6313571 we dont like talking about the center line it overly emphasizes where the storm is likely to go
6313572 my understanding is that the program was approved by the nccu faculty senate
6313573 i think it was well intentioned but somebody just dropped the ball in making sure it was accredited
6313574 the catfish bit just as soon as she got in the house
6313575 were still trying to spread the gossip three consecutive bowl games could do that
6313576 we talk about trying to make that wf stand for something
6313577 two consecutive bowl games doesnt do that you need 10 in a row 20 in a row like your big programs
6313578 that things have changed were not a bad football program that were respected
6313579 we dont want to be a team that has a few good years and just fades away
6313580 wed like to be seen as a good program that every year is expected to win
6313581 in the acc it was always a couple teams and it wasnt wake forest
6313582 this year will maybe prove the point if there were any doubters that every year the championship has to go through wake forest
6313583 there is more excitement than i have seen in 16 years
6313584 we may not have had this type of momentum consistent excitement about our football program since peahead walker back in the 1940s
6313585 there is a sense of pride that comes from beating the champs
6313586 we know we were a different team four years ago and they were a different team
6313587 of course but effort is not going to be enough
6313588 playing a great game is not going to be enough a lot of things are going to have to blend in together to have an opportunity to win but were going to try
6313589 im glad my duke team doesnt have to play st marys next year
6313590 i feel pretty sharp making my decisions and making my reads and everything
6313591 if its russell wilson maybe well take him out and put daniel in just so wilson can settle down and look at the defense
6313592 i cant answer that now but ive done it before
6313593 hes not hurt any more than anybody else has been
6313594 he broke the 100 meter record the 200 meter record like michael jackson said hes bad the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6313595 hes a great athlete and to win eight gold medals is great im on the track and hes in the water so you cant compare
6313596 i mean come on youve seen it its ridiculous hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6313597 that would mean ill go home with the gold not the way i want to go home with it but if three people stepped out thats a gold medal for me
6313598 the most impressive athletic performance ive ever seen in my life
6313599 are you interested in participating in a real mission to the moon
6313600 i was in the same class with neil armstrong at purdue
6313601 only trouble is he went on to be famous and i didnt
6313602 is the result of nine months of work from a white piece of paper to what you have here
6313603 you just dont launch a rocket to the moon without a lot of paperwork

6313605 it was either this or go to dance recital with my sister
6313606 i just came here because i didnt want to do homework
6313607 it takes time to get used to everyone as most guys have been playing together for a while
6313608 but it hasnt been difficult theyre good players and all i have to do is adapt to the way they play which is really good soccer
6313609 umm did you guys not just hear what i said i was a bitch to several people last fall seriously a bitch
6313610 you know i really didnt think i would come back here i loved the wedding last year i loved being here i loved that whole weekend but for some reason i didnt think i would ever come to visit again and im glad i did
6313611 i believe we have created a historical breakthrough with this game

6313617 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6313618 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6313619 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6313620 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6313621 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6313622 in history there have only been two successful fashion dolls barbie and bratz and mr larian and mr bryant stole one of those

6313625 senator barack obama is a champion for arts and culture who is the first presidential candidate to have developed a policy regarding support of the arts prior to entering office he believes that the arts should be a central part of effective teaching and learning the manifest hope gallery is a powerful and unique show of support for this unique candidate

6313630 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6313631 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6313632 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product

6313716 exchange banks top executive j barrie graham resigned unexpectedly as president and chief executive officer of sonoma countys oldest and largest commercial bank
6313717 graham a former u s marine with a no nonsense demeanor was just the sixth president of the 118 year old bank he joined exchange bank in 1995 leaving wells fargo amp co to become the banks chief operating officer in 2003 graham replaced reinking as ceo and led the bank as it shifted strategy to pursue growth more aggressively
6313718 colleagues inside and outside the bank were stunned by the news as it spread rapidly tuesday across the countys business community

6313721 the santa rosa bank has suffered losses in two of the past three quarters its first in at least 50 years according to bank officials and its stock has lost half its value over the past two years

6313723 exchange bank wrote off 14 5 million in bad loans during the first half of this year compared with 500 000 a year ago said bruce decrona the banks chief financial officer
6313724 overall 5 percent of the banks 1 2 billion loan portfolio is 90 days or more overdue or not accruing interest about 10 times what the bank aims for decrona said
6313725 exchange bank could end the year with a loss as officials tap income to write off bad loans and sell foreclosed properties
6313726 it tells you a higher percentage of their loans are involved in construction the bank made a lot of money on these loans it was probably the most dynamic area of growth in their loan portfolio
6313727 with hindsight you could say they did go too far but these were developers with multimillion dollar net worth that exchange bank had longtime relationships with

6313865 when the government takes digitisation of television to over 55 cities in the next 12 15 months conditional access system will come into play customers will have to switch to digital television from our experience we can say that people will prefer dth over digital cable the idea therefore is to grab as many customers as soon
6313866 we expect upgrades to higher denomination packages from starter packages new channel launches and better uptake of value added active services to raise arpu for all key players over the next two to three years
6313867 lets get this clear its not a war were all for digitisation the challenge is to convert from cable to dth when the market matures its the customer who will decide which platform offers better service

6313871 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6313872 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6313873 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6313874 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6313875 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6313876 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what stands for and believes in
6313877 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6313878 in 2006 i will only buy real estate that fits my objectives

6313880 il processo formale di integrazione stato lanciato con listituzione di questa commissione
6313881 un segnale importante ma lo anche per limportanza sostanziale che riveste
6313882 these reforms express my deep belief in our public schools and their mission to build the mind and character of every child from every background in every part of america
6313883 multiple opportunities to correct school and district data prior to finalizing ayp status
6313884 on parents perceptions of schools and their enrollment decisions on the morale of school staff and on the nclb sanctions to which schools are subject
6313885 to either the state or to a private company with a demonstrated record of effectiveness
6313886 unfortunately this law does not help us accomplish those goals nclbs inflexible formulas lead to some misleading results and require sanctions that are often unnecessary or counter productive
6313887 i think all this lip service we hear caring about poor and immigrant groups is just a smoke screen for proving that the public schools are failing so they can go to plan b which is vouchers
6313888 if we were going to provide extraordinary intervention so we could help these children i would be cheerleading nclb
6313889 i became a special education teacher for two reasons because i wanted to both teach and advocate for people with disabilities while going through the teaching credentialing program i envisioned myself empowering and educating a group of students who have been left behind in the past what i didnt expect to be doing was administering tests that were not only inequitable but unjust and cruel i will never forget my first year of teaching only four years ago a student in the fifth grade whose ability and performance level as determined by his iep to be at 2nd grade forced to endure days of a test at an ability level he in no way could perform burst into tears as he sat sobbing and clutching his pencil i too felt like crying i believe in accountability and assessment i do not believe in cruel and unusual punishment when is this going to stop
6313890 actually undermined the quality of teaching in reading and math
6313891 not teach them how to pass a test that says they can write
6313892 when teachers decision making power is limited their ability to be innovative in meeting student needs is also limited thus leading to feelings of frustration and to a sense that their educational role has been reduced to that of a technician removing decision making power from the teacher is a clear example of de professionalization
6313893 high stakes test based accountability doesnt lead to school improvement or equitable educational possibilities
6313894 it leads to avoidable losses of students inherently the system creates a dilemma for principals comply or educate unfortunately we found that compliance means losing students
6313895 theyre trying to make sense out of this theyre trying to survive
6313896 sachin tendulkar has just got to be the greatest batsman of the generation

6313907 why does asian cricket not take care of its young
6313908 surveillance efforts by chinese authorities increased dramatically over the past few days
6313909 the chinese government is petrified of these peaceful acts of defiance simply because they represent the true feelings of tibetans inside tibet
6313910 our protests are a reminder to the world of the tragic reality of the chinese governments illegitimate occupation of tibet and the urgent need for the chinese leadership to seek a resolution with the tibetan people
6313911 in odis one has to understand that with age it gets a little difficult and in the beginning of their careers the senior players didnt do as much physical training which has now become intrinsic
6313912 frankly speaking fielding plays a very integral part in odis these days
6313913 the younger legs make a huge difference im not taking anything away from them the seniors they are great cricketers in their own right but youth does make a difference and at the end of the day winning matters
6313914 you can call it what you like dileep but you have to admit that at the end of the day what we are witnessing at old trafford and sabina park is real cricket played by real men the rest is just evening entertainment robin uthappa and suresh raina can mouth all they like about fitness and youth but until they learn to construct an innings and to be consistent they are merely at playschool as i keep saying time and time again where is the next great indian batsman and more importantly at a time where the focus is all about wam bam will he be able to shine
6313915 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6313916 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6313917 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6313918 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6313919 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6313920 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6313921 issuance by the honorable court of a temporary restraining order coupled by present conditions in some areas in mindanao dictate sic that the moa in its present form must undergo a thorough review
6313922 the executive department will pursue further negotiations with the milf to address the issues hurled against the moa
6313923 merely a codification of consensus points reached between both parties and the aspirations of the milf to have a bangsamoro homeland
6313924 be given the chance to govern themselves as a sub state entity within the larger philippine nation state
6313925 in the moa as much as possible they avoided using terms that were not agreeable so much before to the other panel such as reference to the constitution and enabling laws

6313936 rosslyn is een verbazingwekkend gebouw het is een groot stenen boek maar vanwege het symbolisme dat in een middeleeuwse taal is uitgebeeld zijn we zelfs niet in staat om de inleiding te ontcijferen
6313937 er zijn heel wat verschillende reeksen te vinden in de diverse delen van de kapel iedere reeks verwijst naar een andere tijdsperiode
6313938 we moeten teruggaan naar de 15de eeuw en de afbeeldingen lezen met een middeleeuws oog om te kunnen begrijpen wat het allemaal betekent al deze symbolen verwijzen naar gebeurtenissen in de geschiedenis het is een boek gehouwen in steen dat alle facetten van het apostolische geloof vermengt met een astrologisch tintje dat de seizoenen vertegenwoordigt en de planten in die seizoenen laat zien
6313939 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6313940 many parents ignore the forms see how words mean everything
6313941 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6313942 while we welcome the reduction in the number of lhbs which we have argued for since their creation it is simply not right to leave nhs workers with an axe hanging over them
6313943 can the minister guarantee those workers will continue to work in the nhs and if so how if the minister is keen to reduce bureaucracy she must demonstrate how scrapping the lhbs will achieve it
6313944 the health minister will not take any lessons in people management from those who one week say we have too many staff and another week claim to be their best friend
6313945 mrs hart has regular meetings with representatives of the workforce to update them on the nhs re structuring plans senior trade union representatives are also working closely with the assembly government on helping to design the new look health service
6313946 if youre spending a great deal of taxpayers money you should be accountable for what you do and how you are remunerated if people are doing a good job and their details are out in the open we wont begrudge them

6313959 the clinton and bush foreign policy teams acted on the basis of two false premises
6313960 one was that russia is innately aggressive and that the end of the cold war could not possibly change this so we had to expand our military alliance up to its borders despite all the pious blather about using nato to promote democracy the belief in russias eternal aggressiveness is the only basis on which nato expansion ever made sense especially when you consider that the russians were told they could not join the other premise was that russia would always be too weak to endanger any new nato members so we would never have to commit troops to defend them it would cost us nothing they were wrong on both counts
6313961 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6313962 we have been informed by the hong kong authorities that mr gadd was denied entry to hong kong and has returned to bangkok mr gadd was in contact with us seeking consular assistance
6313963 as a result of todays talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members

6313974 these kinds of matches for the last year or so i was losing them

6314023 dalam bahagian kedua ini sumpah sah dilakukan oleh seseorang yang
6314024 perkara yang menjadi objek sumpah pula ialah perkara yang lalu atau yang akan datang manakala perkara yang digunakan untuk bersumpah ialah nama allah dan sifat sifatnya dengan didahului oleh huruf qasam iaitu waw ba dan ta
6314025 sumpah seperti ini harus dilakukan jika difikirkan perlu seperti untuk menguatkan percakapan atau kenyataan
6314026 dan ia juga bukan sumpah mubahalah seperti yang terdapat dalam ayat 61 surah al imran kerana mubahalah memerlukan persetujuan pihak kedua
6314027 jika seseorang bersumpah dengan mushaf atau meletakkan tangan ke atasnya atau berkata demi quran ini maka ia adalah sumpah yang sah mengikut pendapat imam syafie hanafi dan hambali

6314119 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time

6314160 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6314161 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people

6314182 when it comes to lists im still more of a pen paper kind of gal i needed a little something to keep the small ones more organized a scrap of linen a small piece of chip board that i had in my scrap drawer some ironing and a glue gun was all that i needed to make this to do list holder i wanted something firm to write on and compact enough to tuck into a handbag the sheets i will write on will be index cards or cut down sheets of paper from my recycle stash
6314183 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6314184 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6314185 to foster promote and encourage sportsmanship teamwork and camaraderie through the sport of sled hockey specifically aimed at a juvenile and adolescent population of physically and or mentally challenged athletes
6314186 inherent in that goal is the development of a sense of self esteem pride and friendship within this population we also focus on the development and nurturing of positive attitudes in and outside the long island community toward those with physical and or mental handicapping conditions
6314187 my thought process was just wandy not to say q had problems with him just in the last two of the three we havent been real good
6314188 they always work well together wandy and ausmus the thought was to keep quintero and let him catch most of the time but well give brad a shot to catch wandy they always work well together and its good because its brads last time playing here
6314189 i thank god because god has given me opportunities to keep doing this job that i know how to do ill keep pitching and try to pass some more
6314190 i was at zero on the list once and now im at fourth which means ive passed a lot of good dominican closers like mel rojas and alfonseca all those were good closers to put me fourth on the list is an honor

6314193 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6314194 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6314195 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6314196 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6314197 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6314198 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6314199 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment

6314201 tell them i just hijacked a truck from the army
6314202 everywhere ive ever gone ive tried to find someone to look after
6314203 it was the best thing i did in my life
6314204 i dont think thats fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the tour championship but ive kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway i won the memorial and that didnt get me in the u s open
6314205 anyway thats how my year has been going and i have to keep proving myself and i have to somehow get back on the horse and play well this week
6314206 i knew when i didnt win the first one i was toast
6314207 now thats the story now telling it elegantly low taxes smaller government the way the republicans have i think is more of a challenge
6314208 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
6314209 drivers have spoken to me and said they told police no i dont feel safe i dont want to take them and police have pushed the driver and said no you have to take them because it is your job to take them
6314210 we have a situation where the driver fears for his safety and refuses to take the fare and the police are actually making them take the fare
6314211 the solution is not to just dump drunks in a car by themselves with a driver
6314212 police have all the training experience and accessories to protect them and they are still ready to put these people in a car and make the cabbie go through all the trauma
6314213 its just shifting the problem from one place to another and making it a personal problem for the cab driver mr samuel said
6314214 we dont see ourselves as a service for the refuse of society to get them home
6314215 its a matter for police they will make judgments if they think that somebody has had too much to drink
6314216 its my understanding that if theyve got money on them they put them in the cab give the money to the driver and say take them home
6314217 i believe we are getting on top of a problem caused by people drinking too much and the hundreds of thousands of people in the city on the weekend
6314218 what were trying to do with people is if theyre with friends is get them out of the city and get them home
6314219 if there are taxis close by we get them in a taxi and send them off
6314220 arrest is an option for some people but it is not an option for everyone and so were just trying to get them out of the way and off the street
6314221 ive been working on the need for this program for more than a decade mr forrest said
6314222 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6314223 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas he told abc radio
6314224 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6314225 look i honestly cant understand just where the direction is coming from at the moment mrs hull said
6314226 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and im you know i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and etc that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6314227 i just thought keep fighting keep fighting dont be nervous just smash dont be weak play more aggressively
6314228 ive been preparing for this for two years im 34 years old im not a young player my back hurts always and i always feel very tired
6314229 sometimes i just want to give up but i keep fighting because i wanted to play in the olympics
6314230 i feel that all the chinese are cheering for me this is my home town im very lucky because so many people want me to win
6314231 my father got so nervous that he didnt want to come

6314234 after i do playboy we want to try ivf its asking a lot but if its possible it would make our package complete
6314235 he must be considered like jesse owens in the 1930s however he has a bigger edge over his rivals if he maintains this gap then he will be quite something
6314236 however he still has to mature he is a young man but he should show more respect for his rivals that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6314237 he should shake hands with them after the finish line however he is only 21 and he will learn i have no problems with his showboating prior to the race but a shake of the hand or a tap on the shoulder immediately after the race would be a good gesture
6314238 it would be good not to have a repeat of the catch me if you can gesture

6314272 the nab has made a very good start today they made a public commitment to officially reduce rates if official rates are cut
6314273 this decision by the nab now throws down the challenge to all the other banks
6314274 other banks should have a good hard look at themselves and look at what the nab has done
6314275 we know that banks have had to pay more for money over the last six to eight months as a result of the global liquidity crisis

6314277 what is so amazing about the site is the pristine condition it is in

6314280 the community needs to know that we are beyond reproach in the selection process

6314289 pero realmente tiene futuro la radio por internet sinceramente creo que no nunca lo tuvo
6314290 if youre interested in money youre not going to go into teaching
6314291 the biggest reason for that in my opinion is were not attracting majors in math and physical sciences into teaching careers
6314292 mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado compact
6314293 were going to know over the next year whether the colorado compact is an interest for the governors
6314294 it cant be washington that says the time is right to open the compact
6314295 its got to be we in the region saying were having trouble with this or that and therefore its time to re evaluate the mechanics of the compact
6314296 of colorado river water shortages and agreed to ensure that the levels of lake powell and lake mead are equal
6314297 theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6314298 the lower colorado river basin states have wanted to reopen that compact for years
6314299 they have only one thing in mind when they say reopen and that isnt to give more water to upper basin states
6314300 an express bus route out here would really help our citizens
6314301 this would get some of the cars off the road
6314302 pero realmente tiene futuro la radio por internet sinceramente creo que no nunca lo tuvo
6314303 has public service suffered with state offices being closed on fridays
6314304 the dmv is the litmus test as far as face to face transactions
6314305 is there any reason why the governor decided not to include the legislature
6314306 we did the job that needed to be done to measure the programs success
6314307 i think there is a general concern but i dont know that it rises to the level of taking legislative action at this point
6314308 the highest concern voiced by many senators was the level of service to the citizens of the state
6314309 my view is that you either deregulated trading or you dont so if people dont want deregulated trading you either close every door on a sunday and see how people like that but what weve got is an absolute hash of things theres no rhyme or reason to it its all politically driven
6314310 but a community like mapleton has to have services like police if we dont have money coming in or have a lot of building and businesses we have to find it elsewhere
6314311 you would lose all your employees and have to retrain people
6314312 we have a sacred trust when we have peoples information
6314313 they want to change whats not broken its a constant attack
6314314 its just every time the public employee turns around theres something else being taken away from them
6314315 the intent is that its narrowly focused to people with access to sensitive data
6314316 this really ought to be something that people are grateful that the state is being proactive about
6314317 i think if its handled like theyre proposing im in favor of it as long as its absolutely random
6314318 for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
6314319 sushi is held at room temperature fish used for sushi is not sushi grade and has not been treated for parasite destruction cooked rice is not cooled within acceptable time limits and knives are stored in standing water
6314320 its not always what you say but who you say it to that counts take the case of richard dutcher the utah county filmmaker who in the eyes of some people went from being the john the baptist of mormon cinema to its judas
6314321 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use

6314384 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odours said chemist michelle gallagher who conducted the study at the monell chemical senses centre in philadelphia pennsylvania

6314389 the challenge will be to address wall streets growth and earnings expectations without shortchanging our investment in research and development and the long term future of the company
6314390 while our strategy certainly benefited the company in the past when we were not profitable i believe it is incumbent on the board and management team at myriad to revisit the strategy in light of the dynamics surrounding a profitable company
6314391 given that the company has 9 in cash per share and no debt the earnings power of the molecular diagnostic business may be enough to drive the stock to 70 near term in our view

6314398 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6314399 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6314400 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6314401 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6314402 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6314403 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6314404 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6314405 jonathan do you want to come and watch a movie with me
6314406 because across the universe is a chick flick worse its a chick flick that is about hippies and you know how i feel about hippies
6314407 i still have no idea how you have this hatred of hippies yet loved living in eugene oregon i will also remind you that when you came back from living in the land of the hippies you had bleached hair down to your shoulder blades with a long red beard your mother and i do talk from time to time well leave that for another day though what i want to know is what possible objection could you have about the story of russia afghanistan and the wheels being set in motion to end the cold war that seems totally up your ally
6314408 because it is hollywood and hollywood will put a completely liberal spin on it somehow they usually do besides i rarely look at them for an accurate historical reproduction of anything

6314415 we dont want jurors coming in with an interest in the outcome of the case

6314418 i dont have a placing that i really want to finish but i want to hit every single dive and if i do that ill be happy and a good score will come out of it
6314419 i know exactly what ive done wrong so i dont think its going to be something really hard to change for finals
6314420 theres still a lot of room for improvement for the final i just want to do good dives and i try to stay focused on what i have to do and not paying any attention to whats going on around me
6314421 the realities of our political system require candidates to raise a lot of money from many different sources
6314422 but that doesnt mean it has to be done obscurely or from organizations with interests and agendas dissimilar from utah citizens i want to send a message to utahns that i will be accountable only to them
6314423 i share the sentiments of many utah voters that there is too much questionable money in politics
6314424 as a senator i will give no special favors to any contributors at the expense of district 16 voters even if the contributors are from utah but by creating clear ethical fund raising standards i hope to demonstrate that i am committed to accountability and dedicated to raising the standards of ethical campaign financing in utah

6314432 we asked him to please discontinue the practice because what he was doing was a public safety concern
6314433 did get very belligerent and told us we couldnt tell him what to do on his property
6314434 ive been working on the need for this program for more than a decade mr forrest said
6314435 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6314436 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas he told abc radio
6314437 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6314438 look i honestly cant understand just where the direction is coming from at the moment mrs hull said
6314439 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and im you know i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and etc that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6314440 i dont like his commercials its like he thinks were stupid
6314441 if we dont have to have jobs we can focus on what were supposed to be doing
6314442 thats whats good about being in the olympics now were getting a lot more of that stuff

6314463 we also plan to help business owners leverage the internet to rewire their customer and supplier interactions and other core business processes
6314464 our research shows that 59 percent of australian small businesses dont currently have a website
6314465 through the acquisition of smartyhost we can now deliver a basic website and domain name package to australian businesses starting from under 100 per year

6314479 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies

6314484 the commodore wants to consider very carefully before he walks that road

6314487 weve raised questions throughout the process particularly in relation to the implications to the nonproliferation treaty
6314488 it is a very important document for the u s and india
6314489 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement
6314490 a lot of people have raised questions and many people think the civil nuclear deal does not fit into the nonproliferation framework that is not our view
6314491 false gods whatever name shape or form we give them are nearly always associated with the worship of three things material possessions possessive love or power how many voices in our materialist society tell us that happiness is to be found by acquiring as many possessions and luxuries as we can but this is to make possessions into a false god
6314492 true happiness is not attained through self gratification but through fidelity a worthy purpose
6314493 do not store riches for yourselves here on earth where moths and rust destroy and robbers break in and steal instead store riches for yourselves in heaven
6314494 the illusory pleasures promised by false gods squandered his inheritance on a life of indulgence and ended up in abject poverty and misery
6314495 happy are those who are meek for they shall inherit the earth
6314496 the secret was realising happiness did not derive from wealth power learning indulgence or even religiosity but from living fully in the moment becoming a good human and risking the pain of giving ourselves to what matters life is a continuing challenge to be lived day by day
6314497 the aim of the book cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is to provide information on the technology and clinical applications of this type of noninvasive imaging for assessing cardiac disease part of the contemporary cardiology series the 780 page resource is targeted to cardiologists radiologists primary care physicians and mri technologists and others who are interested in the technique the physics of the cardiac mri is discussed as well as safety and monitoring
6314498 i thoroughly enjoyed cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging although primarily a textbook for cardiologists and radiologists radiologic technologists can benefit greatly from this interesting book the included dvd brings the text to life it is both informative and entertaining this book is an extremely good deal for the price i highly recommend it for the department library as we find more and more uses for mr being knowledgeable in present and future developments will prepare technologists for changes that are coming
6314499 i think within the next three to five years we are going to see multiple companies carrying ticket buying passengers up to the edge of space so they can experience the blackness of the sky and see the curvature of the earth and experience the thrill of weightlessness
6314500 what thats going to mean is after the shuttle retires in 2010 and until we start seeing the human flights of ares 1 and orion in 2015 or so the u s government is not going to have any vehicles that they own or operate that carry people into space but its likely to be a very busy time for commercial human spaceflight both suborbital and orbital and that means its going to be a busy time for the faa because those flights are going to be licensed by our office so were going to be right in the thick of that

6314513 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6314514 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6314515 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6314516 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6314517 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6314518 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6314519 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6314520 they want to know what were going to do about it
6314521 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6314522 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6314523 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6314524 my shoe certainly provides no more of an advantage than the speedo swim suit and no one is saying michael phelps should be barred
6314525 the shoe returns energy but all shoes return some energy it is not spring loaded and not motorised it is mechanised and common sense tells you it should not be banned
6314526 the energy the shoe returns reduces the stress on the body that means you are more likely to avoid injury
6314527 at my age ones muscles change this shoe is helping me a lot and i dont see why anyone could think that is a bad thing
6314528 a couple of weeks after that he had a meeting with all of his coaches and i knew we were going to get along
6314529 i loved his sense of humor we were from the same part of pennsylvania outside of philadelphia hes full italian im half so we had all these italian things going on there was a lot of common background and we hit it off
6314530 that this guy had a lot of self confidence he was not going to be intimidated by anyone on the staff about his job hes always going to do what he thinks is right in the job regardless of the consequences and ive always respected that
6314531 furthermore after our first year working together i told him and other people youre going to be here at least 10 years if you choose to be i felt that good about his ability there was a mutual respect from the beginning
6314532 that would be an absolute thrill for me and a great challenge for us
6314533 i look at them and i see us and i think when they look at us they see them
6314534 its a style of play an aggressive kind of play based on pitching and defense offensively theres a little bit of difference in philosophy they have more guys that just swing we have more guys who can work an at bat they have more experience overall than we do but i think were built on basically the same concepts
6314535 they have similarities in the way they run a game
6314536 personality wise they are complete opposites but when they run the game they both think everything through thoroughly
6314537 joe is unbelievable i know for a fact he thinks three innings ahead what might happen what could happen what scenarios he wants and chooses having played for both of them theyre incredible joe is just really good at adapting and learning from everything im sure hes grabbed a lot of scioscia but he puts it in his own mold
6314538 but hes one of the coolest guys ive ever been around
6314539 his personality is like a spider it goes in all different directions he wants to be a complete man which is something maybe we should all want
6314540 but theres no doubt you give joe the opportunity to build and give him input on what kind of players theyre going to draft what the player development is going to be what the major league philosophy is going to be hes going to have them going in the right direction
6314541 its great to see ive seen it firsthand joe is a terrific evaluator of talent and hes got a passion for the game that is off the charts
6314542 they are more experienced and stronger but we have made great strides for these olympic games this is the best that we could do

6314560 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6314561 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6314562 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6314563 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6314564 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6314565 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6314566 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6314567 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6314568 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6314569 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6314570 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6314571 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6314572 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6314573 the external affairs ministry has taken up the issue with our neighbour more than once but so far our proposal has not received any response
6314574 fruits from kashmir should reach the muzaffarabad market rather than delhi as it takes just two hours to reach pak occupied kashmir to reach delhi it takes 12 hours but islamabad has to permit it first
6314575 we all know trade between two nations does not take place like this
6314576 but that could be dangerous for the whale because if it doesnt find a lactating female its just out there on its own and theres all sorts of sharks out there
6314577 we dont want to be stressing the whale out by whatever we choose to do
6314578 the thing thats coming home to us is whatever reason that caused the mother to abandon it may be the same reason causing other pods to reject it
6314579 until then the advice we have is that unless something miraculous happens like the mother whale turning up its looking bleak
6314580 a senior vet from taronga zoo examined the whale last night and while the whale is not distressed his condition has deteriorated as he hasnt fed in days
6314581 previously the whale was lured out to sea by following a yacht that it thought was its mother but then it turned around and came back in because i think it was still attached to the yacht
6314582 if we can get it into the sling we can get it further out to the ocean into deeper water and hopefully closer to another pod of whales
6314583 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
6314584 we must try to save this baby whale to do nothing is not an option we are happy to build a tourism industry around these beautiful creatures and now the time has come to pay it forward
6314585 attempts should be made to feed the whale we have the technology the personnel and the dollars that can be put behind the operation
6314586 the most humane thing though it is a terribly sad thing would be to put it down there is no point in prolonging its suffering in the foolish and arrogant presumption that we could save its life
6314587 what silent movie could i alone among the b masters do justice to in a review
6314588 it is going to be a very exciting challenge to ensure applabs achieves its substantial growth plans in the european market we see great opportunities to engage with more customers not only in the uk but also with the worlds largest organisations based in mainland europe i am confident that our european customers will benefit more from our renewed focus
6314589 we are experiencing a very exciting period of business expansion in europe and we need experienced executives and visionary business leaders like graham to take the company forward

6314592 whatever concerns anyone may have had that this might become some clever way to undermine the rights protected under roe v wade have i think been addressed
6314593 unless someone attempts to disrupt this effort by dragging the abortion debate back into it i have little doubt that it will be passed without much controversy
6314594 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
6314595 i told the proponents that the bill simply wasnt ever going to get through as long as there was suspicion that it was a back door way to get at roe v wade or criminalize abortion in illinois
6314596 i told the proponents just give us some extra language that will establish a comfort level for the pro choice community
6314597 they said it wasnt acceptable they said the feds didnt need those kinds of words why did we need it
6314598 it wasnt necessary the bill would have passed without it pro abort legislators needed a reason to support it in the face of mounting pressure and added those 2 redundancies to save face
6314599 obama held born alive on march 6 2003 from even being voted on in committee it is also important to note from the docket that on march 13 2003 obama stopped the senate sponsor from adding the lately discussed clarification paragraph from the federal baipa to make the bills absolutely identical
6314600 obama as chairman of the committee that vetted illinois version in 2003 refused to allow an amendment rendering both concluding paragraphs identical he also refused to call the bill and killed it
6314601 illinois prosecutors and officials with the ill dept of public health are hereby enjoined from initiating any prosecution including but not limited to criminal proceedings or imposing any sanction for violation of or enforcing in any way any of certain defined the provisions of the illinois abortion law of 1975 against any physician offering or performing abortions or pregnancy terminations
6314602 given that the bottom line is that the bill has only passed when its critics are satisfied that its utterly meaningless this doesnt seem like a particularly substantive debate over whether or not he wants to kill living infants
6314603 im a little bit excited im a little nervous at the same time because i havent done it in over a year
6314604 but i think once the first punt comes back ill be alright
6314605 i think i can handle punts pretty well its a different phase of the game that allows me to be more of a football player it allows me to make plays
6314606 we will continue with that this week to give him another opportunity to get some good cohesion with those guys
6314607 it is easier for sean because they have 17 20 games dating back to last year to get an understanding between him and kendall simmons and so forth we feel like in order to get a better evaluation hartwig needs more time
6314608 i always felt i would be back before the timetable anyway i always have whenever i had anything done before but you want to err on the side of caution
6314609 it is an exciting trip for me because i have some good friends there
6314610 although i wasnt there for a great deal of time it felt good to be a part of what we were building there
6314611 the figures included in cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease reveal in a simple yet powerful way the basic strengths and characteristics of this long awaited textbook from charles mullins
6314612 the 35 chapters dedicated to this small highly specialized field with unique technical demands covers topics ranging from the optimal floor plan of a modern pediatric interventional catheterization laboratory to the energy requirements for radiofrequency perforation of an atretic valve to the precise method of handling guide wire positioning in the distal part of the circulation during balloon dilation and stent implantation a comprehensive detailed technical manual the chapter on transcatheter atrial septal defect occlusion arms the interventional cardiologist with detailed knowledge of all the available occluding devices and the particular tricks for using each of these devices and delivery systems in a full 50 pages of text similar attention is paid to techniques and tools for obtaining vascular access and for performing balloon dilations although some of the very specific information provided will become obsolete rather quickly points on the prioritization of balloon characteristics desirable for a particular intervention or the general principles of wire placement and device handling will always remain relevant as a technical manual this text is extremely successful this textbook will accomplish the authors goal of providing useful information to readers practicing at any level within the subspecialty field of pediatric interventional cardiology to trainees and those recently entering the practice who may have had extensive exposure to pediatric interventional techniques but limited hands on experience this text will serve to solidify many of the concepts and common techniques used in the pediatric interventional laboratory advanced operators will use it as a reference and a technical narrative of minute details to aid in the planning of particular cases or in the management of infrequently encountered situations as such it is an enormously useful and long awaited addition to the field of pediatric cardiology
6314613 cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease is an outstanding textbook based on the experience and practice of the author during four decades of work in the catheterization laboratory at the baylor college of medicine texas childrens hospital and who has been an innovator and leader in the field of cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease for those 40 years
6314614 cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease pediatric and adult is an exceptional book it is without doubt the most authoritative the most comprehensive and the most detailed textbook about cardiac catheterization in congenital heart disease ever published each chapter is well referenced unlike most familiar texts of this magnitude dr mullins wrote every chapter and every word this is all his work any cardiologist seeking education or information about venous stenting need only study this one source it is obvious that with this book dr mullins gives each of us a gift in the preface he tells us that the information contained in this text represents the accumulation of knowledge techniques and procedures learned utilized and or developed by the author during the continued learning practice and teaching of cardiac catheterization procedures during four decades in the field
6314615 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6314616 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6314617 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6314618 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6314619 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6314620 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me

6314622 los nuevos convenios firmados entre el servicio murciano de salud y las empresas de ambulancias les ha dejado sin transporte por las tardes
6314623 sin informar previamente a las asociaciones de enfermos se han modificado los horarios y ahora las ambulancias s lo recogen por las ma anas lo que supone que los enfermos y sus cuidadores tienen que modificar sus horarios para adaptarse a las empresas de transporte sanitario cuando deber a ser al contrario
6314624 en la mala forma en la que se ha hecho ya que los cambios no se han comunicado con antelaci n y los enfermos y cuidadores no se han podido planificar
6314625 se han doblegado los intereses de los enfermos dependientes a lo que marca un convenio colectivo

6314632 if georgian president mikheil saakashvilis absurd demand that the peacekeeping operation be halted in abkhazia is implemented the region will risk being plunged deeper into crisis by the unhealthy ambitions of the incumbent georgian authorities
6314633 considering this we think it impossible to resolve the fate of the peacekeeping operation without taking into account the opinion of the abkhazian side

6314635 the share of revenue generated from multi year contracts has increased we will also be able to sign off a number of long lasting project proposals in contracts in the second half the ebita margin was under pressure during the first half of this year costs incurred for project proposals start up and running expenses of a few large projects as well as hiring more contractors were important contributing factors the loss of robeco direct as a client has a negative impact on the revenue and profit development in the coming period additionally we will lower our cost levels
6314636 the integration of nuances mobile solutions and enterprise speech solutions allows it to sharply reduce the costs of customer care and improve the quality of customer experience for mobile operators and large enterprises
6314637 the first year we started with 200 to spend and it came about because teachers were telling us that kids were coming to school ill prepared that they didnt have school supplies so our club decided the first year that we would take this on as a project from there it has grown to over 25 000 we have to spend
6314638 this has been planned for well over a year now the program actually started in other libraries around oregon particularly the big urban libraries this service is offered 24 hours a day seven days a week whether the library is open or not from any geographical location in the county

6314644 its nice to get out there and put the pads on and really feel like a part of the team
6314645 the main thing for our defense is having another playmaker out there the more playmakers you can put on the field the better for your defense
6314646 he looked fine he was running out there hitting some people i think that is the main thing he wanted to get done to tap somebody just to get a little nudge and see if the shoulder pads feel like they fit right and all he looked great out there
6314647 its so close to the season you dont want an injury to set you back during the season
6314648 i am learning to be more patient its not easy not for anybody
6314649 i want to be at full strength against the houston texans that is my concern i also want to be ready physically i would like to get some preseason reps well see
6314650 thats what i tell all of the guys its good to have you out there but i dont need you to be there until september 7 against houston
6314651 get out there when it really counts and you are 100 percent with a player like him you have to allow him to get his body 100 percent ready the season is so long you have to be totally healthy before it all starts
6314652 smaller businesses can find it tough to avoid the black hole of information overload docushare express puts smbs on equal ground with large enterprises when it comes to managing information and gaining efficiencies

6314655 the cancellation of the memorandum of agreement is a painful step in our collective effort to come to an agreement with the milf
6314656 she arroyo will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of law set within the constitution furthermore the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6314657 the australian communications and media authority acma has strong concerns about the broadcast in australia of programmes that contain terrorist related content
6314658 the flyers we distribute help get the word out and advertise the small rewards program a lot better than soldiers going out and telling the people about it
6314659 these munitions getting taken off the street is a good thing
6314660 it means that they cant be used against us later on
6314661 the cooperation from everyone on the fob has led to us recovering more artillery than all of afghanistan combined
6314662 our intent was to allow every 2 3 and 4 on our team to play and to show where exactly they stand
6314663 i was disappointed overall not only in assignments but in execution in position mastery and just effort overall
6314664 we hoped to see where wed have to consider some players to play and to move up what we saw was not only a big drop off with the offense and defense but special teams took a drop off even more some players at some positions there was so far of a drop off we couldnt function
6314665 stephen covey gets one drive and does what the other quarterbacks were unable to do and thats get into the end zone
6314666 i thought oneill chambers showed athleticism and made some plays just as he has in every scrimmage i thought the defense was more in a state of readiness than the offense and the offensive line controls that
6314667 there will be other things that stand out when we watch film
6314668 the lack of readiness can be leveraged if we uncovered a punt blocker or another receiver or defensive back it was worth the format today
6314669 its the furthest along any team has been since ive been coach weve accomplished the goals and objectives we set out to do were as healthy as weve ever been as talented as weve ever been and i think our execution is solid right now my hope was after today id feel better about our depth thats not what i feel now but the players in front of them i feel very good about
6314670 a lot of the northern iowa work was done this summer
6314671 well go back and revisit that with more knowledge of our team now well see if our plans still fit or if we need to alter them
6314672 i dont see any significant differences right now from this defense to last years or the year before its certainly logical to say were young and inexperienced and it may take them a while and it might but when i look at the leadership of fowler bauman nixon and jorgensen i think it will end up being a good defense i dont think it will take as long as some people expect
6314673 its a whole other day my last jump doesnt even matter
6314674 the track is so fast that a lot of people have had to adjust to it
6314675 i ended up getting all of the board on my second qualifying jump

6314681 cemex believes the confiscation and subsequent start of the expropriation process is a flagrant violation of the constitution law of expropriation and other laws of venezuela
6314682 cemex also believes the venezuelan governments actions highlight a lack of respect for the principles of international law and the treaties relating to reciprocal protection of investments which forbid the occupation of goods and deprivation of rights without fair and effective compensation and without an expropriation procedure

6314687 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6314688 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6314689 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6314690 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6314691 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6314692 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to

6314703 and we owe them something more the tools necessary to be able to do their job

6314705 and i am pleased to report to the american people that these tools will be available for future administrations to protect the american people for years to come
6314706 in your opinion are employees more or less competitive with their co workers than they were 10 years ago
6314707 in an uncertain economy people grow more concerned about job security and work harder to prove their worth to employers
6314708 a bit of healthy competition among staff can increase motivation and productivity but just as in sports the overall results of the team are what count too much intramural competition creates tension and stands in the way of collaboration

6314715 pfc owens is a dependable soldier who can get the job done
6314716 he was in pouring rain and he was covered in scratches and bruises and goodness knows what his stomach was empty the doctor said so he hadnt been eating and he was pretty close to death when they found him
6314717 he was conscious but away with the fairies he wasnt able to make a great deal of sense
6314718 hes a bushwalker he just loves that type of thing
6314719 he just went out for a two hour walk to a waterfall in the jungle and there was a second waterfall and he decided to go to that as well
6314720 then the downpour of rain just washed away all the walk tracks so he became hopelessly lost
6314721 when he didnt return to his lodgings they went searching for him a ground search but that was at the wrong waterfall
6314722 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult
6314723 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
6314724 he just said it took them three hours to get where he was and thats all theyd allow him to say
6314725 hes in critical condition but there has been slight improvement
6314726 now and again he has to have a special operation yesterday he had an operation for bleeding in the stomach

6314744 and you have a situation that the rest of the world views with shock and incomprehension
6314745 its a pretty traditional criminal law that accomplices and co conspirators are equally held culpable
6314746 you dont have to specifically agree to commit a killing you agree to commit the target crime then any other crimes that are foreseeable youre responsible
6314747 flies in the face of a broader effort to reserve the death penalty for extreme cases
6314748 they argued clearly and unambiguously that reneau was the bad actor
6314749 then after getting the death sentence at woods trial they essentially conflated the two men they argued that they were in this together
6314750 you can go from that blueprint and build whatever house you want
6314751 thats something that we as black americans have given to the world the concept of the blues but at the same time im of a different generation i didnt ever have to go to the back of a bus if i was out on the road i wouldnt have to camp in my car because they wouldnt let black people in the hotel so im trying to represent what my tradition is and then represent my individual self in the contemporary moment
6314752 its all very painful to watch but im willing to go through it time and again if it can help stop the same happening to other youngsters
6314753 the final scene is perhaps the hardest ben is desperately searching for a vein to inject into he looks as if he is dying as the heroin passes into his body its as if you can see his life just ebbing away
6314754 its incredibly rare to come across such raw and unflinching footage of a man so close to an abyss and i was literally speechless when i first watched it
6314755 i hope it will be a way for people to get a visceral understanding of the nature of addiction and it will be a privilege to try and unpick who ben really was using the intimate legacy hes left behind
6314756 ben and annes bravery in documenting this tragic period will undoubtedly make for one of the years most powerful films
6314757 bens lies and manipulation as he mixes his next hit whilst telling his mother anne he is clean and making a new start
6314758 the film reveals annes anger and tears as ben loses his fight against the drugs and shows how father mikes unconditional love is tempered by his total resignation that they have lost the battle against their sons addiction
6314759 this film is an incredibly intense and very moving portrayal of one mans descent into the final stages of addiction
6314760 but it also reveals an intimate portrait of one ordinary middle class familys 13 year battle to save their son

6314762 the news signals ebays renewed focus on competing with amazon com and other e tailers in fixed price
6314763 while these changes will increase listings impact to the demand side of the equation remains to be seen
6314764 given that ebay made no change to financial guidance as a result of the lower insertion fees the increase to final value charges are clearly significant
6314765 our goal with our pricing change is to be the most competitive marketplace on the web period

6315008 the prime minister was deeply sorry to hear about todays tragedy in spain
6315009 his thoughts are with the spanish people and all those affected by the tragedy
6315010 there were 11 injured including natives and police officers in the clashes
6315011 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would someday remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalization
6315012 this action must be resolved quickly it involves time sensitive issues with potential ramifications for multiple third parties
6315013 the process for approving new owners is critically important to the success and long term stability of the nba

6315017 im not a man who believes in revenge although he mistreated me i dont have any score to settle with him but somebody who dismisses the parliament subverts the constitution arrests the judges must tell the people why he did that he must answer these questions under whatever forum the law provides

6315020 we demand the foreign minister and the foreign ministry immediately revoke every type of passport belonging to thaksin and pojaman who are criminal fugitives
6315021 thaksin is a criminal who is avoiding an arrest warrant issued by the court why can he still have all kinds of passports
6315022 im a right wing economist so they cant call me a communist
6315023 what makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do

6315027 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin its looking bleak but every effort is being made
6315028 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6315029 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000 km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6315030 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6315031 i think the guards did exactly what they were trained to do i think it was a life threatening situation and they were in immediate danger ms brown 45 said told the daily telegraph online from her rooty hill home
6315032 that will depend on what the vets decide this afternoon
6315033 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6315034 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6315035 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6315036 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6315037 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6315038 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6315039 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6315040 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6315041 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6315042 stand at the crossroads and look ask for the ancient paths ask where the good way is and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls

6315047 as the forerunners of western civilization creeping up the river valleys and across the mountain passes the trappers brought smallpox and typhoid they brought guns and whiskey and venereal disease they brought the puzzlement of money and the gleam of steel and on their liquored breath they whispered the coming of an unimaginable force of a gathering shadow on the eastern horizon gorging itself on the continent as it pressed steadily this way

6315055 abu dhabi is an obvious choice for a boat show as it is the richest of the oil laden united arab emirates has a large expatriate population and is aiming to transform itself into a global tourist destination
6315056 diverse sports amp leisure pursuits are part of the active lifestyle residents enjoy in abu dhabi and the most recently announced 2009 formula 1 abu dhabi prix ferrari theme park and warner brothers theme park are all situated on the yas island a 2 500 hectare island development
6315057 we have received overwhelming support from abu dhabi as the host and from the marine industry in particular with regard to the timing of the show
6315058 with the emirates boat show international in abu dhabi we will be well on the way to providing the luxury marine industry in the middle east with a year round calendar of events that marine enthusiasts could look forward to
6315059 for us at knotika boat shows are not just about boats but also everything that goes with the marine lifestyle
6315060 people do not buy a boat just to own it they want to enjoy it to live the culture and that is what we are bringing to abu dhabi this is not simply a boat show it is a marine lifestyle exhibition where they will be able to see and buy the latest coolest and must have yachts and marine products
6315061 de problemen op de huizenmarkt zijn nog niet over het wordt alleen maar erger
6315062 habib wasnt involved at all he didnt give us any instructions to attack the rally it was just our expression of disappointment
6315063 i feel pretty sharp making my decisions and making my reads and everything
6315064 if its russell wilson maybe well take him out and put daniel in just so wilson can settle down and look at the defense

6315067 surveillance efforts by chinese authorities increased dramatically over the past few days
6315068 our protests are a reminder to the world of the tragic reality of the chinese governments illegitimate occupation of tibet and the urgent need for the chinese leadership to seek a resolution with the
6315069 i still had the lead but that changed the momentum
6315070 in a way that took a little pressure off me because people dont expect me to win
6315071 i played solid the first two days but i still havent putted very well
6315072 the only long putt i made was the one at no 18 otherwise wednesday was just a total scramble
6315073 if it is a great distance we will certainly go back in with joe cutcliffe said
6315074 the guy has unusual ability is truly a long range field goal kicker
6315075 you can live with that percentage in field goal range and 100 percent on extra points cutcliffe said

6315078 were still trying to spread the gossip three consecutive bowl games could do that
6315079 we talk about trying to make that wf stand for something
6315080 two consecutive bowl games doesnt do that you need 10 in a row 20 in a row like your big programs
6315081 that things have changed were not a bad football program that were respected
6315082 we dont want to be a team that has a few good years and just fades away
6315083 wed like to be seen as a good program that every year is expected to win
6315084 in the acc it was always a couple teams and it wasnt wake forest
6315085 this year will maybe prove the point if there were any doubters that every year the championship has to go through wake forest
6315086 there is more excitement than i have seen in 16 years
6315087 we may not have had this type of momentum consistent excitement about our football program since peahead walker back in the 1940s
6315088 this was a rough summer from flying from city to city for nba workouts to dealing with
6315089 its been kind of tough but i think it has matured me a lot
6315090 coach roy williams talked to larry bird and they were real high on me he said
6315091 but they called and said they had a lot of problems with things like that there were a couple of people they named but they called and said they just cant take a chance it probably affected it my decision a little bit
6315092 you live and you learn you go through things he said
6315093 maybe it happened for a reason you cant go back and think about it now you cant change things so im just looking forward
6315094 he said i probably was already punished enough by larry bird and them calling indiana and not being able to go to the league and it affecting me lawson said
6315095 during the operation more than 30 militants were killed and a large cache of mortar rounds and ied improvised explosive device materials were destroyed by the commandos
6315096 we did some work on it today it loosened up a little bit
6315097 id hate to have to play against our offense in a real game itd drive me completely crazy trying to figure out whats coming next
6315098 i sure dont understand how it all works the way it does
6315099 the planes are still in the air people are scared and are staying indoors
6315100 we think we have the right to decide on the presidency
6315101 but the july data indicated that the economy is not deteriorating rapidly
6315102 the outlook for the japanese economy essentially hinges on a recovery in the us economy oil prices are falling which is good news but i think it is still too early to predict the outlook
6315103 since last year we have been seeing a gradual slowdown in japans export growth the latest data confirmed this trend this is a reflection of the continued worsening of the global economy
6315104 rising prices of raw materials have affected the domestic demand of asian countries as well as the developed nations
6315105 deber amos preguntarnos qu es lo que hacemos en afganist n

6315109 la construcci n de afganist n pasa por supuesto tambi n por la erradicaci n del terrorismo pero tambi n sobre todo por la reconstrucci n civil
6315110 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything i dont anticipate that they will do that
6315111 the commander in chief must always listen to the commanders and not the latest opinion polls
6315112 americas future leaders must remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and thats where our military must stay
6315113 you live by a code and you fight for a cause and im honored to be your commander in chief
6315114 she was so thin at one point when she was not well that she looked like a dog
6315115 dont make mid year budget cuts because it could have devastating impacts on our students
6315116 its like anybody can play certain sports that arent real hard
6315117 and heck we didnt even win a national championship last year
6315118 university of florida continues to make great strides even amid the great financial challenges that are facing our state and our university
6315119 we talked about trying to revive it but the cancer took most of our time people have occasionally asked about it and i just finally got around to it
6315120 ive always wanted to continue if i could i dont know why i didnt do it sooner
6315121 i try to summarize not just the individual contributions but also how much came from a business how much came from individuals
6315122 it could be useful to voters it depends on what you want to vote for without the knowledge you cant say
6315123 those of us who care a lot sometimes feel like a lone voice crying out in the wilderness
6315124 im intending to link to buyers guide on my site because there is useful stuff on there and if it gets people to pay attention thats great
6315125 i shall dream of a world where crapatacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
6315126 i am what i am because thats what i am
6315127 todays partnering agreement secures the long term supply of ammunitions to our armed forces
6315128 the 15 year programme will ensure that the uk has a modernised sustainable munitions industry which will support british jobs and protect our capacity to produce ammunition
6315129 it is absolutely essential to the conduct of operations and training that we have a guaranteed uk based high quality source of ammunition
6315130 you can imagine that the rate of production that we are now at its been some achievement to keep that going in that period to make sure that we deliver on time
6315131 the seemingly softer tone to the committees discussion in keeping with a more muted outlook in the inflation report does seem to have pretty much ruled out any prospect of a rate hike which was already slim as it would risk an unnecessarily deep downturn
6315132 although we envisage the first rate cut next year there is every chance that the mpc begins to cut as early as november especially if commodity prices continue to fall and economic activity falters as expected
6315133 concerns about demand were a more important factor in restraining investment than restrictions in the supply of credit although credit was becoming harder to obtain
6315134 there is virtually no competition between the london airports and the two in edinburgh and glasgow whereas under separate ownership new operators would make the most of the opportunities and generally behave as companies do in a free market
6315135 here we are today with shortage of capacity and the earliest date by which we could build a new runway at stansted is 2015 and at heathrow is 2020
6315136 baa has not been particularly adventurous and has tended to plan its investments on a sequential basis there is also very considerable criticism of the lack of responsiveness by baa to airlines needs
6315137 the new terminal at heathrow took 22 years not because baa was slow but because the planning officials did not have a government policy against which to compare the project
6315138 my fear is that by changing the policy progress will perversely be slowed down
6315139 we need root and branch regulatory reform of the airport monopolies and i am not confident that the dft review will meet those requirements
6315140 the strength of emotion amongst travellers about improvement in airports is considerable
6315141 ultimately the whole aim of competition is to introduce better service at lower price which is the opposite of what monopolies provide but it is a long process
6315142 there wont be an immediate result or any noticeable effect in the near term
6315143 the short length and complexity of the new franchise is seen to favour the incumbent
6315144 como he dicho siempre es un honor jugar para la selecci n estoy orgulloso de estar en europa y ser mexicano
6315145 soy un afortunado me toc hacer los goles y estoy m s contento por la actuaci n del equipo y por la gente que hizo un lleno extraordinario
6315146 hoy en d a tenemos bastantes jugadores lo que genera una competencia fuerte y para el t cnico resulta una dificultad escoger quienes juegan
6315147 no nos enchuf bamos como equipo para hacer da o y al fin pudimos hacer los goles necesarios
6315148 nosotros tuvimos que correr m s hacer un mayor esfuerzo para poderlos superar
6315149 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6315150 i had no idea what it looked like out there until today
6315151 it pretty much came up to my ears and chin
6315152 i saw this little kid coming toward me so i grabbed him and swam him back to the shore line and went back for the other two guys
6315153 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6315154 i am honored and humbled by this opportunity to serve
6315155 floridas cities are home to so many innovative solutions that ive been able to bring back to gainesville because of my involvement with the florida league of mayors
6315156 one it was a 16 year old and two it was a 16 year old female
6315157 it could be that bad water everywhere sinkholes overflowing retention basins
6315158 this is probably one of the most difficult storms ive seen in terms of having to make decisions based on the forecasted track
6315159 keeping ahead of the storm becomes difficult when it slows down weakens strengthens again heads out over the ocean then heads back over the coast again weve been in and out of the tropical storm force wind field off and on for the past few days
6315160 the thing hasnt moved more than 20 or 30 miles all day
6315161 one model shows it moving 30 to 40 miles in the next 48 hours
6315162 people who have lived through one storm here know what to expect
6315163 if theyre new to the area they should talk to their neighbors its not just a matter of where you are its the design of your home you may not be in a low lying area but if your garage door sits at the bottom of a hill you may still get water coming under your door its important to assess your personal situation and not just rely on whether or not youre in a low lying area
6315164 and there are isolated places throughout the county where its going to feel like youre walking on a wet sponge

6315182 la oferta presentada a cemex es menor a lo ofrecido a las empresas europeas considerando ndices de valor por tonelada de capacidad instalada y m ltiplos de ebitda
6315183 cemex believes the confiscation and subsequent start of the expropriation process is a flagrant violation of the venezuela
6315184 cemex also believes the venezuelan governments actions highlight a lack of respect for the principles of international law and the treaties relating to reciprocal protection of investments which forbid the occupation of goods and deprivation of rights without fair and effective compensation and without an expropriation procedure

6315208 ik had een heel ander plan in gedachten ik had niet verwacht dat ze op elke service van mij meteen kon aanvallen

6315215 as a result of todays talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members
6315216 because of the improved offer all planned industrial action is suspended until we get the reaction of the members

6315222 they are the most affluent lot among real estate buyers in india showing interest in buying large chunks of land in their home country they are not affected by the current slowdown as they take a long range view of the whole scenario they have faith in the indian economy and firmly believe that the prices will appreciate by at least 10 to 15 per cent every year they see the downturn as an opportunity to invest in large chunks of land or even developed areas which they get at a good discount from even the top developers
6315223 according to our assessment despite a slowdown in the last six months the interest of the nris has increased almost by 20 25 every quarter that is almost two to two and a half times in the last two to three years
6315224 many nris in the us and uk are not as confident as before of sanctity of their employment while others are disturbed by negative economic patterns across developed countries they see greater potential for india overcoming current economic setbacks sentimental attachment to their country of origin is another reason
6315225 the gulf nri is one who is bound to return nris are looking for decent returns and might think of holding property in india while investors from uk and usa are pure investors nris mostly have an affinity to the areas they come from
6315226 the property price upswing seen in the indian market has made nris very bullish about the indian real estate nri segment contributes to about 25 30 investment both for the end use and for investment
6315227 many nris have shown keen interest in luxury homes in places like khar bandra and powai due to their vicinity to the airport also there has been interest in projects in kandivali and borivali for many maharashtrians abroad pune is the preferred location for investment many a times a crisis situation in their country brings them to other countries for investment

6315238 i have told you these things so that in me you may have peace in this world you will have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world
6315239 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6315240 gordon browns visit has been really great for the town most people have been very positive
6315241 the extra publicity has meant that despite the sometimes less that brilliant weather there have been more tourists here in southwold
6315242 i believe mr browns visit and the fact that he holidayed in this country has lead to a surge in british tourism which i think is very important as it is vital to know about your own countrys culture and what it has to offer
6315243 it has been fantastic for the area that he has been here
6315244 the general feeling is that it did bring a lot more people into the town businesses have said that there were a lot more day trippers here and many of the hotels said that they have had a lot more last minute bookings as a result
6315245 his visit certainly created a fantastic buzz around the town and got people talking to each other about the visit
6315246 whether the visit will have a long term affect on tourism we dont know as yet but certainly the prime ministers visit and that of charles and camilla who visited the adnams brewery as part of a suffolk tour the end of last month brought southwold to the front of peoples minds
6315247 we have not received any more holiday let bookings than any other year
6315248 time will tell as to whether the visit by gordon brown influences further business for suffolks tourism industry
6315249 we have been lucky this summer to have seen both a serving prime minister and the heir to the throne both choosing suffolk the associated coverage which has depicted a flourishing and high quality destination can only be to our benefit suffolk homes
6315250 a pedicure is not a very enjoyable experience the normal pedicure we wanted to make it much more enjoyable and fun loving for people we thought that when they come here they should enjoy and have a good experience we wanted to give them a lively experience and through fish pedicure we have been able to give them that
6315251 initially its a bit scary its a very nice feeling before i used to keep coming for the normal pedicure and manicure now i keep coming for this because its different its like entertainment when you see those fishes doing it
6315252 and because its on the nintendo wii youll buy it like the mindless brainwashed lemming that you are and you like it because nintendo says you will
6315253 s war von vornherein noch bevor die wii erschien klar dass die wii einfach nicht lol also mal ehrlich ihr wundert ihr euch wenn kritik von der leser seite her kommt vor 13 stunden 51 minuten
6315254 it has certainly got everyone talking and it is nice that it has put the town on the map
6315255 it is not nice for the people who cant sleep but for everyone else it is like a treasure hunt or a whodunnit a lot of people are very inquisitive about what has caused it
6315256 the rumours include a spaceship and electricity pylons while we even had one woman suggest the noise was similar to the one made by insects when she was holidaying in malta
6315257 another man living in minneapolis emailed and said it sounded like it could be air conditioning the general consensus is that it is something industrial
6315258 i had my suspicions but now other people in the town have noticed it i am completely thrown i just hope we can locate the noise as soon as possible and the council can do something as it is getting annoying
6315259 we have received no complaints so we cannot pursue it any further we have asked the community warden and others to be more precise about the possible location suffolk homes
6315260 i was told years ago by a doctor that my condition was going to end up with renal failure
6315261 for the past couple of years when i have been getting blood test results i somehow thought that that is just what they say and it would not happen to me but about five months ago a doctor told me that i was going to have to go on dialysis soon
6315262 kidney donation in particular is considered a very easy surgery
6315263 it is the type of thing that if it was going to affect anybody negatively i would not be asking
6315264 obviously if somebody donated it would benefit me but i also think it would benefit the donor i would really hope it would create some kind of connection between us and also make the person feel really good about themselves i think it would be really nice for the right person
6315265 from my point of view i would be at a loss for gratitude
6315266 knowing that you have done such a wonderful and altruistic thing as save somebodys life must be a great feeling
6315267 it is really true that having something like this makes you feel so much more appreciative of everything and i am a really happy person in general i can say that i am in a much better frame of mind than i was before it really does make you feel so extraordinary thankful for everything
6315268 sse has long argued for a break up of baa and is therefore delighted by the provisional findings report from the competition commission concluding that baa must sell two of its three london airports
6315269 we consider it inconceivable that baa would willingly sell heathrow which means that stansted and gatwick must both be sold
6315270 this will not in itself remove the threat of a second runway at stansted but we believe it moves us a step closer to the day when this idea will be abandoned
6315271 we wont be distracted by the issue of ownership and we will continue to make the case that building another runway in this rural location would be an environmental calamity
6315272 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6315273 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6315274 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6315275 let me state categorically that cosatu not only respects the independence of the judiciary but actually regards it as the cornerstone of our hard won democracy
6315276 it is just a myth driven mainly by media hysteria that we have no respect for these pillars of our democracy
6315277 where we draw the line is the attacks on an individuals dignity without giving the courts an opportunity to make their own determination
6315278 this in my view undermines the role of the constitution and the courts more than anything else
6315279 the headlines were genuine criticisms of particular judicial decisions which are then conflated into a supposed attack on the judiciary as a whole
6315280 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6315281 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernised in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6315282 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favour and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs
6315283 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6315284 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6315285 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6315286 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6315287 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6315288 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it

6315302 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6315303 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6315304 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6315305 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6315306 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6315307 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6315308 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6315309 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6315310 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6315311 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6315312 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6315313 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6315314 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6315315 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6315316 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6315317 losing the game to argentina in this way is really shameful

6315320 we have to stay united because a classic rivalry is always decided on details
6315321 we trust each other and now we have to search for our motivation because thats the way the olympics are i had a wonderful experience at the olympic village seeing how happy other athletes were to win a bronze medal and we want to feel the same

6315378 but we created chances especially in the first half and played well but we suffered when they counter attacked and this is a problem we must work on

6315438 i think were killing him liverpool play on saturday at home against middlesbrough youll see a man there who will run the game
6315439 he gerrard did not play left so you have to explain that to redknapp
6315440 we played 4 3 2 1 defoe gerrard and rooney then three midfielders
6315441 in that position you have to play between the lines of the full backs and midfield
6315442 i decided before the game that rooney and gerrard they had only played one game will play this for an hour
6315443 i think we were controlling the game in the second half
6315444 at 2 1 we had a big chance to score again and if he scored we probably would have been winners of this match
6315445 england are a very strong team and they showed that with their late goal but it is not very often you draw against england we were very near to winning but it was still a good draw
6315446 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6315447 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6315448 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6315449 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6315450 it is important to do that when the business of the qualifying campaign begins and we are keen to make up for what happened last time
6315451 it was a difficult night playing against a good team early on in the season and most of us played on sunday
6315452 it was a tough game but we got a good draw against a good side but we are disappointed not to have won

6315470 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
6315471 that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade
6315472 this is a huge exhibition so we had to extend it beyond glenbows four walls

6315478 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6315479 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6315480 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy
6315481 though almost nothing about this has been reported in the western press human intelligence and open sources are indicating the agreement could be signed in beirut as early as monday when hezbollah leaders and salafists are scheduled to meet
6315482 according to our sources despite the age old shiia sunni religious opposition as well as recent bloodshed between the two radical islamist organizations hezbollah and salafi leaders have been negotiating a sort of memorandum of understanding for some time
6315483 one of the catalysts for such an agreement is based on intelligence suggesting the iranians have flooded the salafists in lebanon with money in order to undermine moderate sunnis even shiias who are attempting to move toward democracy in lebanon building ties with lebanese christians and druze
6315484 sources say both extremist groups are issuing statements primarily in the arab media such as muslims should not fight muslims but should instead bring all forces to bear against the west which is trying to divide us
6315485 the biggest challenge facing a young journalist in todays media is

6315488 the course is similar or equivalent to a course offered at a high school in the district as determined by the school district board of directors
6315489 improvement is change with direction sustained over time that moves entire systems raising the average level of quality and performance while at the same time decreasing the variation among units and engaging people in analysis and understanding of why some actions seem to work and others dont leadership is the guidance and direction of instructional improvement
6315490 the results are quite frankly disappointing we will haveto chart a new course over the coming months to get heijmansback on track this will however require outlays before benefitscan be reaped
6315491 dont get me started on the mozzarella stick she said

6315503 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6315504 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6315505 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6315506 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6315507 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6315508 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6315509 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6315510 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6315511 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
6315512 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
6315513 at just 2ft 9in indian muscleman aditya romeo dev is the worlds smallest bodybuilder

6315515 sara why are you sitting down when there is a customer there
6315516 there is clearly concerns on inflation and the weakopening says that we should be languishing around the samelevel
6315517 inflation numbers will determine the near term trend ofthe market the numbers are not expected to excite the marketand this could weaken the indices towards close unless ofcourse global cues improve
6315518 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6315519 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present
6315520 we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned
6315521 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6315522 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6315523 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6315524 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6315525 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6315526 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6315527 in history there have only been two successful fashion dolls barbie and bratz and mr larian and mr bryant stole one of those
6315528 the numbers are what they are and the law says when you profit by taking someone elses confidential information you have to give it back

6315530 i dont know i thought thats what i was supposed to do in the light
6315531 right well good job on being the biggest douche in heaven what can we do for you
6315532 yea actually i wanted to ask him why youre such an ass
6315533 i think what you want to ask is why do i have such an ass dream on dads in his office as usual
6315534 hello nick i havent seen or heard from you in quite some time how are you
6315535 im okay i mean i could be worse so im not complaining
6315536 well i just got done with a visit from my dad i mean he went back to
6315537 yea so i was talking with him and he is certain that you gave him a second chance when he died he says that he now lives his life in a way to please you and in return youve blessed him
6315538 well to me my dad seems pretty enlightened hes happy hes healthy and he seems to pardon my french have his shit together why dont i have that does someone have to have a near death experience to gain this enlightenment what sacrifice must be made to be happy
6315539 your fathers enlightenment came of his own accord if he wished to attribute it to me then thats his prerogative as for his disease i did help him with that he prayed night and day not for a cure but for his family to be happy he didnt want me to save his life instead he wanted me to help you his family deal with his passing that kind of nobility deserved to be saved your father was pretty much dead and everybody knew it he had a five percent chance of survival and it shrank every hour he paid his penance for his alcoholic years he sacrificed faced judgment and came out clean i did give him a second chance and he isnt wasting it
6315540 how do i gain enlightenment how do i get to be happy
6315541 nick my son youve had many near death experiences youve faced untold traumas and have most certainly paid and are still paying for your sins enlightenment does not come from hardship it just seems thats the only way you humans retain information you have to be burned before you realize fire is hot heres my advice
6315542 just open your eyes and take a big look around everything is there for you to see you just have to be willing to look past your own limitations a happy life is simple just follow the basics treat people how you want to be treated live a clean lifestyle a penny saved is a penny earned you know all that jazz
6315543 yea that ben franklin was a genius anyway listen nick you have to realize something life isnt going to hand you anything you have to earn it you want a happy full life then start living like you want a happy life stop dwelling on the past because i promise you there is no way to change what has happened only what is yet to come start small with something that seems so inconsequential such as waking up earlier to start your day or maybe do a few sit ups or push ups or even a jumping jack or two to start your morning it only takes starting one thing to change your life you just have to decided when and how to change it i do enjoy our visits nick but as always prayer works just the same please go back and start making those changes you deem necessary to make yourself a happier you i love you nick and i always will
6315544 this is good as the extent of fund raising through an issue of shares that will result in a dilution of equity is less now
6315545 instead they are putting their investment book to good use by selling stakes instead of just earning dividends from them
6315546 they may have got better valuations a few months back but this will still be a better way to unlock value and raise money
6315547 reflects the strategic value of theparticipation in line with the long term perspective of theinvestment
6315548 construction firms are looking at hiving off these projects into holding units and sell stakes in them to recycle blocked capital
6315549 firms started falling over themselves to win such projects and had cut down the irr by 2007 it had become messy as firms were quoting off the cuff rates
6315550 there is no point in borrowing and investing to get return of 12 per cent when your own cost is 13 per cent
6315551 whatever bot projects we are bidding for will be keeping in mind the interest rates and inflation
6315552 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6315553 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6315554 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6315555 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6315556 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6315557 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6315558 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6315559 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6315560 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e mails
6315561 its designed to make a copy of data at a specific point in time
6315562 data is backed up on a daily weekly and monthly basis as part of a disaster recovery strategy to ensure to protect the organization from data loss
6315563 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten i can only take you so seriously
6315564 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6315565 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6315566 a time in which they experienced strong feelings of love for their current partner
6315567 you cant tell us what we can do with our reproductive rights
6315568 you dont get a choice in your options because youre wrong and thats that
6315569 the construction space would be on the buy list not the infrastructure asset side like a noida toll bridge or any of those companies i would definitely look at a buy on a larsen and toubro or hindustan construction simplex i think order books are doing very well commodity prices are coming down they have enough work to do both in india and overseas to justify any kind of growth forecast that we may have for them for the next two years at least given that and the fact that the pe ratios have come down drastically in the last three four months i would definitely keep that on my buy list
6315570 we did a study on the index from last year to this year when the index was 15 000 and this was in august and there were only two sectors which have given us outperformance and thats fmcg and pharma pharma has been a dark horse it is something that one should definitely keep on the buy radar and find picks which one may feel comfortable with because thats one sector which not only give you comfort in bad times but definitely gives us a robust domestic demand substitution for whatever we have in terms of a slowdown in the economy so these are the two other sectors that one would keep on the buy
6315571 sail showed a good move it has had support around rs 130 135 if it can get past rs 154 then rs 171 is a good level globally although metal prices are coming down but steel is showing good resilience
6315572 ispat is not my favorite and even among steel stocks it remains weak it has got support around rs 24 and it may trade upto rs 30 31 but that is where one must book profit
6315573 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6315574 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6315575 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6315576 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
6315577 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
6315578 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit
6315579 investment banks had been frustrated with the established exchange because they really were never able to get control of it
6315580 have catastrophic economic effects on millions of already stressed u s consumers
6315581 commodities and currencies are clearly the strongest business they have right now
6315582 im not chewing it though the rules are you cant chew it in class im not though

6315584 in terms of downside real estate has been consolidating and stocks like unitech have held on to their previous bottoms
6315585 also in banking at lower levels things like indian bank with a stoploss of about rs 88 90 is a good bank to enter one good days one can get out at rs 125 130 so try to take those trading 10 15 kinds of moves because the large moves are not happening
6315586 armenia was always in favor of dialogue and talks particularly on the issues concerning cooperation and security in our region therefore we really appreciate turkish statement on the intention to start talks with armenia

6315594 we are showcasing it and encouraging other councils to use it
6315595 we suggest it might be a good idea to at least try a pilot of la crm
6315596 we can build a community with it and the community keeps building it developing it and keeping it alive
6315597 with the comprehensive spending review a lot of funding for customer relations has dried up councils are asking how to continue their crm strategy and what might be cost effective
6315598 our national teams are meeting for the first time and no doubt it will be a difficult match because armenian team is quite powerful
6315599 however our players will be on top form by the match
6315600 ive noticed that im focused on my error right now

6315606 to me there is no need to review the contract signed in bucharest ukraine and georgia will become nato member countries
6315607 russia is a great nation look how we have been treating it
6315608 stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy
6315609 we told the world this is about starting an invasion
6315610 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and south ossetia this is about getting russian troops out
6315611 well we know we made the mistake in the sense of we improperly installed transponders on these meters thats what we discovered and as soon as we discovered it we let customers know about it
6315612 we want to make sure its fair for both sides because youve got those individuals who have been back billed and potentially unfairly so but in the meantime all other consumers have made up for those costs
6315613 i dont think all the consumers either should cover that cost the company makes a profit the ceo the managers are all paid bonuses it should come out of those pockets because theyre the ones who are responsible for the mismanagement
6315614 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6315615 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6315616 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6315617 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions

6315620 simon whitfield demonstrated the true spirit of olympic competition and proved that he is a world class athlete
6315621 congratulations simon that was one of the best showing of heart and sheer determination ive ever seen
6315622 simon is an inspiration to all canadians and a classy ambassador for the triathlon
6315623 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6315624 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6315625 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6315626 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6315627 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6315628 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6315629 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6315630 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6315631 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends

6315820 but the huge amount of strategic planning and the leap of faith are delivering a first rate calibre of cast there is a real buzz about the project in manhattan as quentin was a much loved and notorious figure everyone has an anecdote to tell about him

6315863 this will give us plenty of room to grow in the next five years
6315864 we have to focus on the academic achievement of all of our students
6315865 were out on our own not with our parents anymore no one can tell us what to do
6315866 we just want them to get a jump start on academics
6315867 it gives them a little independence a nice transition from the high school setting they like making friends ahead of time getting to know campus before everyone gets here
6315868 the time management part was what i had to adjust to
6315869 not having my mom here to stay on top of me make sure im doing my work having to take responsibility to manage my own actions make sure im spending my time wisely i like it
6315870 its something i knew i needed to do for a while
6315871 it sounded like a great idea to kind of introduce you to the college course load it also gets three credits out of the way so im taking one less course first semester i can get used to balancing all my classes
6315872 there are not all these rules everyone assumes everyone else is mature theres more discussion you dont have to raise your hand its just more fun
6315873 when you finish studying evening rolls around were like what do we do now
6315874 at home my room was always a mess but here i try to keep it clean people are always in here and its hard to find stuff in such a small space
6315875 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin its looking bleak but every effort is being made
6315876 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6315877 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000 km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6315878 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6315879 every year that i have been on the board i have received large numbers of calls from parents begging for additional staff
6315880 this is usually the case the first day or first week of school it has been limited to one or two schools this year will be different
6315881 we know if a district had all the money it needed it would take care of all this stuff itself
6315882 but this is reality there is not going to be enough money to take care of every school
6315883 its a well kept building but it looks like a typical school
6315884 environment does affect the way you feel about what you do
6315885 so i expect the new paint the new furnishings and the murals will just make the building a lot more attractive and make us feel good about being here
6315886 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6315887 a guy came into the hospital and said you dont know me but i was one of those people you hauled out of the x ray
6315888 he joined the navy and hated it the ocean thing was not his bag
6315889 he was tenacious about getting into flight school he drove them insane until they let him in
6315890 he was a super instructor he was not one of these guys who get excited very easily
6315891 anyone who flew for the government had to get past him
6315892 were a bunch of loose cannons we have our own opinions but everything is in jest
6315893 if he thought he was right he didnt care if he told a general he was wrong he was a mans man
6315894 qu l stima nos han parado la prueba yo creo que se quedaba fuera pero bueno as es esto habr que pelear

6315899 at the start of the year we noticed demand was increasing
6315900 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing so his debt attracts more attention
6315901 if youre a debtor ill make sure that everyone who knows you knows that you owe money
6315902 your neighbours your clients your suppliers youre not going to like that
6315903 the way these companies approach consumers often borders on being illegal
6315904 acting in a way likely to be publicly embarrassing to the debtor

6315908 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6315909 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6315910 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6315911 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6315912 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6315913 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6315914 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6315915 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6315916 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6315917 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6315918 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6315919 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program

6315926 ugh transparencies the bane of our existence i cant tell you how many times they have messed up our copiers
6315927 its the little things you dont realize or think about until youve done it before
6315928 the school started out with no name no mascot not even a mailing address
6315929 they like to stick the work in your face without really showing you how to do it
6315930 hes one of the reasons why im going back to school
6315931 it was pretty hard to hear that you have to go to a different school in your senior year
6315932 i basically feel like a freshman i basically will be starting over
6315933 determined that how the commission decided whether a dispute qualified for the settlement process was ambiguous and undefined contributing to a perception that it was acting arbitrarily and without justification
6315934 these next steps reflect the shared commitment of the legislature and my administration to building trust in our tax system and the public servants who administer it
6315935 the commissioners should not treat independence as isolation and need to improve communication by establishing clear guidelines regarding the proper level of communication
6315936 that takes statutory changes and rule changes i have no problem with what he put there but they are not steps to cure the problem there needs to be much more done

6315940 the long stride means he ate up so much more track than everybody else did with each step and for once he ran through the finish line
6315941 this performance was much better than the 100m because we saw bolt giving it every single ounce of energy even a lean at the tape he was just trying to hold that speed for as long as he could and grab that record which hes done
6315942 he will do it the 400 and he promised itll be six years from now
6315943 i hope that i dont fit into those anytime soon
6315944 it is going to be what it is going to be on the day it might be super hot and humid or it might be cool or anywhere in between i will be ready for whatever comes
6315945 i dont think i have ever spent this much time in a hotel room and i certainly have never watched so much of the olympics

6315953 amazing its jaw dropping you work so hard and for it to actually come true and realize that it happened that you raced the best in the world and for you to come out on top its a blessing
6315954 i feel the world is out there for me to go and get i still feel like i have so much more to show the world

6315969 doa itu senjata orang mukmin tiang agama cahaya langit dan bumi hr
6315970 dan doa orang orang kafir tu hanyalah sia sia belaka
6315971 tidak ada seorang muslim pun yang berdoa dengan sesuatu doa yang bukan doa menyangkut dosa atau menyangkut upaya memutuskan silahturrahim kecuali allah akan memberinya dengan salah satu dari tiga kemungkinan segera dipenuhi nya doa tersebut atau disimpan nya sebagai simpanan pahala di akhirat atau dihindarkan nya dia dan bahaya atau kejelekan yang sebanding para sahabat bertanya bagaimana kalau kami perbanyak rasulullah saw menjawab allah akan memperbanyak lagi
6315972 doa akan dikabulkan bagi seseorang di antara kamu selama ia tidak terburu buru yakni dengan mengatakan dalam nada kecewa dan protes aku telah berdoa kepada tuhanku tapi ternyata dia tidak mengabulkan doaku dalam sebuah riwayat muslim ditambahkan lalu iapun mutung dan tidak mau berdoa lagi
6315973 berdoalah kepada tuhanmu dengan berendah diri dan suara yang lembut sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang melampaui batas
6315974 maka ia nabi yunius as berdoa dalam keadaan gelap yang berlipat yakni keberadaannya di dalam perut ikan di dalam laut dan di malam hari tiada tuhan selain engkau maha suci engkau sesungguhnya aku adalah termasuk orangorang yang dzalim maka kami pun mengabulkan doanya dan menyelamatkannya dan kedukaan dan demikianlah kami selamatkan orang orang yang beriman
6315975 jacob has taken away all that was our fathers and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth
6315976 return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives and i will be with you
6315977 you know that i have served your father with all my strength
6315978 yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times however god did not allow him to hurt me
6315979 if he spoke thus the speckled shall be your wages then all the flock brought forth speckled and if he spoke thus the striped shall be your wages then all the flock brought forth striped
6315980 thus god has taken away your fathers livestock and given
6315981 then the angel of god said to me in the dream jacob and i said here i am
6315982 do we still have any portion or inheritance in our fathers house
6315983 are we not reckoned by him as foreigners for he has sold us and has also entirely consumed our purchase price
6315984 surely all the wealth which god has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children now then do whatever god has said to you
6315985 be careful that you do not speak to jacob either good or bad
6315986 what have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword
6315987 why did you flee secretly and deceive me and did not tell me so that i might have sent you away with joy and with songs with timbrel and with lyre
6315988 it is in my power to do you harm but the god of your father spoke to me last night saying be careful not to speak either good or bad to jacob
6315989 now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your fathers house 31 then jacob replied to laban
6315990 the one with whom you find your gods shall not live in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take it for yourself
6315991 let not my lord be angry that i cannot rise before you for the manner of women is upon me
6315992 what is my transgression what is my sin that you have hotly pursued me
6315993 though you have felt through all my goods what have you found of all your household goods set
6315994 these twenty years i have been in your house i served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock and you changed my wages ten times
6315995 if the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had not been for me surely now you would have sent me away empty handed god has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands so he rendered judgment last night
6315996 the daughters are my daughters and the children are my children and the flocks are my flocks and all that you see is mine but what can i do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne
6315997 so now come let us make a covenant you and i and let it be a witness between you and me
6315998 this heap is a witness between you and me this day
6315999 may the lord watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other
6316000 if you mistreat my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters although no man is with us see god is witness between you and me
6316001 behold this heap and behold the pillar which i have set between you and me
6316002 this heap is a witness and the pillar is a witness that i will not pass by this heap to you for harm and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me for harm
6316003 the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge between us

6316071 tenemos que controlar la bola los australianos no tienen paciencia
6316072 para que los puntas est n frescos los cambiamos cada diez minutos
6316073 su estilo es abrir mucho el campo y jugar a toda pastilla no saben contemporizar a sus defensas les cuesta dar dos pases seguidos donde se sienten m s c modos es en el caos buscan la superioridad en ataque con cuatro para tres esto nos causa pavor a los entrenadores europeos pero divierte al p blico

6316081 lo m s importante es saber cu ndo dar el pase para atacar en bloque en el momento en el que el contrario ha dejado un hueco para esto analizamos los movimientos del rival con un sistema de v deo conectado al banquillo en directo mi ayudante env a fotos desde la grada yo las recibo en un minuto y se las muestro a los lanzadores principalmente a kiko si fallas en el momento de profundizar puedes desproteger a tu defensa
6316082 hemos incorporado aparatos de gps que atamos a cada jugador con un puls metro
6316083 de ese modo sabemos la frecuencia card aca de cada uno qu distancias recorren cu ntas veces en qu zonas del campo con qu aceleraci n y con qu intensidad recibimos la informaci n en directo en el banquillo por ejemplo los delanteros recorren entre 8 y 7 kil metros por partido y los defensas 12 kil metros como en el f tbol pero en una superficie que es la mitad con los datos ajustamos los entrenamientos no tiene sentido entrenar sprints de 60 metros si los jugadores s lo hacen sprints de 5 10 y 20
6316084 para que los delanteros est n frescos a fin de esprintar con frecuencia los cambiamos cada diez minutos
6316085 los sentamos entre tres y cinco minutos y los volvemos a meter
6316086 durante el partido tomamos la temperatura de los jugadores con un term metro l ser apunt ndoles al cuello y a las piernas si se acercan a los 40 grados los sentamos y les ponemos mangas y chalecos de hielo para recuperarlos y vuelven a jugar

6316089 lo importante no era ser primera sino representar a irak

6316091 hay muchas bombas cuando voy al estadio no s qu va a ocurrirme por eso es muy dif cil entrenarse en irak y por eso estoy orgullosa de estar en unos juegos

6316110 i dont know i guess this was the match youve all been waiting for
6316111 i think i had more emotion about playing against the united states when i played them back in shanghai thankfully i got the emotion out then medal or no medal its been a hell of a run and ive given you guys something to talk about for the whole summer
6316112 beckys a friend of mine but all we see is that jersey with russia on it
6316113 were at war at this point we know shes going to be there and its just like the rest of them shes an enemy
6316114 to think of her willingly putting on a jersey for russia is unfathomable to me
6316115 youd have to tie me down and force it over my head and i still would be fighting it off im an american period
6316116 doors open and doors close this one was open for me
6316117 i dont know i guess this was the match youve all been waiting for
6316118 i think i had more emotion about playing against the united states when i played them back in shanghai thankfully i got the emotion out then medal or no medal its been a hell of a run and ive given you guys something to talk about for the whole summer
6316119 beckys a friend of mine but all we see is that jersey with russia on it
6316120 were at war at this point we know shes going to be there and its just like the rest of them shes an enemy
6316121 to think of her willingly putting on a jersey for russia is unfathomable to me
6316122 youd have to tie me down and force it over my head and i still would be fighting it off im an american period
6316123 doors open and doors close this one was open for me
6316124 in order for us to compete were going to have to play flawlessly
6316125 being able to give a team hope thats quite a thing to be able to give
6316126 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6316127 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6316128 hes a real hard worker off the field with a tremendous upside every coach wishes that had a couple deandres on their team and as good as he is now theres still plenty of room to improve his upside is tremendous
6316129 i love this area and wanted to play college football close to my family
6316130 washington has a lot of tradition and great coach im just glad to have the choice out of the way
6316131 he has a lot of experience and is an incredibly hard worker hes simply brutal on the field but thats the way you need to be hes made me a much better player i had to put on about 20 pounds this year to survive the practices with him
6316132 ive seen the outcome of the franklin game in my dreams
6316133 were going to beat franklin i guarantee it were going to beat them and take that momentum into the next game and build from there
6316134 we have a clean slate now were positive focused and proud to be at garfield
6316135 if i can get the kids as freshman that makes a huge difference
6316136 if i can train them for four years it really pays off
6316137 in four years hes gone from a confused freshman to becoming our best receiver and a team captain
6316138 if the numbers of kids turning out keeps going up were going to eventually surprise a lot of people
6316139 i appreciate everything a lot of these recruiting services do
6316140 but sometimes it puts a lot of pressure on these kids
6316141 this ranking is a long time in the making that started with coach gervais
6316142 a lot of this notoriety is from past years which he built
6316143 i like to consider them the best receivers in the state
6316144 a lot of key seniors and a lot of great high school players thats what these rankings sometimes forget
6316145 we have to go out there and make a name for ourselves in that game
6316146 it the expectations really doesnt mean anything thats last years team
6316147 people always insist these girls are the best and they are going to win
6316148 but theyre not unbeatable of course its possible to win thats what make tonights competition interesting
6316149 im going to enjoy it whether im first or fifth whatever place i end up im going to enjoy the ride
6316150 im used it im kind of old you know we have these aches and pains
6316151 but its holding up fine my last entry was great i know its there i just really need to be confident i can use it even though its sore
6316152 but just to be diving here has been a great experience for me
6316153 people always insist these girls are the best and they are going to win
6316154 but theyre not unbeatable of course its possible to win thats what make tonights competition interesting
6316155 im going to enjoy it whether im first or fifth whatever place i end up im going to enjoy the ride
6316156 im used it im kind of old you know we have these aches and pains
6316157 but its holding up fine my last entry was great i know its there i just really need to be confident i can use it even though its sore
6316158 but just to be diving here has been a great experience for me

6316164 ik ben getrouwd met historicus michiel nooren onze drie zonen hebben zijn achternaam sinds vorig jaar juli hebben wij een pleegdochter in huis miesja yogo haar japanse moeder was een goede vriendin van mij ze vroeg mij of ik na haar overlijden de voogdij van miesja op mij wilde nemen
6316165 het is een rustige woonbuurt met een gemengde samenstelling van de bevolking we hebben veel contact met de buren het enige nadeel vind ik het uitzicht je kijkt hier altijd tegen stenen aan
6316166 een leuke combinatie van mijn twee interesses boekhouden en culturele antropologie
6316167 ik vond het vreemd om mij ineens als iemand anders voor te stellen onze trouwdag was een formaliteit omdat michiel dan niet in dienst hoefde gehuwde mannen waren duurder voor het leger we hebben pas na een week aan onze ouders verteld dat we getrouwd waren zo ging dat vaker in de jaren zeventig
6316168 je moet altijd erbij zeggen of je het met een of twee sen met of zonder n schrijft bovendien is het een heel gewone naam nooren klinkt bijvoorbeeld veel deftiger
6316169 dat is best moeilijk want het gedicht dat meestal over de natuur of mensen gaat mag niet rijmen moet bestaan uit drie korte regels moet vooral zelfstandige naamwoorden bevatten en moet ook nog een emotie oproepen soms is dat een heel gepuzzel
6316170 ik sta open voor religie maar geloof hoort mijns inziens thuis bij de psychologie van de mens het is iets wat mensen zelf hebben verzonnen om hun zorgen te kunnen loslaten mijn motto is wat gij niet wilt dat u geschiedt doet dat ook een ander niet daar kom je in dit leven een heel eind mee
6316171 and in this way you are doing great justice to your friend and saving him from sorrow
6316172 this relationship is not good not only from a jewish standpoint but also on a personal level
6316173 there are good chances that love wont last and will become disastrous this is because the relationship is external and is contradictive to his internal being
6316174 theres a key for every lock just as theres a perfectly fitting label for everyone who refuses to fit in
6316175 there is clearly concerns on inflation and the weak opening says that we should be languishing around the same level
6316176 inflation numbers will determine the near term trend of the market the numbers are not expected to excite the market and this could weaken the indices towards close unless of course global cues improve

6316184 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon
6316185 many more people could be killed or wounded unless russia allows professional demining organizations to enter at once to clean the affected areas
6316186 highly dangerous unexploded bomblets now litter farms roads and pathways in shindisi and pkhvenisi
6316187 people remaining in these areas dont realize the dangers these submunitions pose and are at serious risk of injury or death if they handle or even approach the bomblets
6316188 we did not use cluster bombs and whats more there was absolutely no necessity to do so
6316189 we were playing with them as were the georgian soldiers
6316190 it was only when one of the bombs exploded after a soldier threw it that we understood that they were dangerous
6316191 there are so many of these lying around the fields are full of them
6316192 it would be incorrect to claim that the ethnologist has merely described a curious exception

6316197 were likely to get a much grimmer view of the construction industry than persimmon warned us about just a month ago
6316198 this comes against the background of the uks biggest mortgage lender halifax telling us that the value of our homes has slumped by more than 10 over the last year
6316199 it is pretty safe to assume that the pass rate at a and a is going to be 20 or more this year
6316200 there has been a lot of effort put into improving maths standards
6316201 we could be starting to see some of the fruits of that
6316202 this year there are more options than ever before for those wanting to stay in education and for those who prefer to work and learn can aim for a job that offers an apprenticeship or some form of recognised training perhaps with day release to a local college
6316203 during the operation more than 30 militants were killed and a large cache of mortar rounds and ied improvised explosive device materials were destroyed by the commandos it said

6316212 michael has confirmed that he is not suffering with a terminal illness and is seeking professional help in adelaide with the support of his family we are asking our church to pray for the guglielmucci family during this difficult time
6316213 the national executive is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
6316214 we are very concerned for the many people who have been or will be hurt by michaels actions
6316215 we encourage all of our churches to pray for all those affected

6316228 at the start of the year we noticed demand was increasing
6316229 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing so his debt attracts more attention
6316230 if youre a debtor ill make sure that everyone who knows you knows that you owe money
6316231 your neighbours your clients your suppliers youre not going to like that
6316232 the way these companies approach consumers often borders on being illegal

6316237 il karate non deriva n dal confucianesimo n dal buddismo
6316238 nondimeno se i kata devono essere classificati si pu in maniera molto generale distinguere due grandi gruppi quelli che appartengono allo shorei ryu scuola shorei e quelli che appartengono allo shorin ryu scuola shorin il primo mette laccento sullo sviluppo della forza fisica e della potenza muscolare e sorprendente per limpressione di forza che sprigiona al contrario la scuola shorin molto leggera e richiama senzaltro il rapido volo del falco in verit molto impressionante osservare un uomo possentemente costruito eseguire un kata della scuola shorei soggiogando losservatore con limpressione della sua forza assoluta ma bisogna riconoscere che tende a mancare di velocit allo stesso modo non si pu evitare di restare molto impressionati alla vista di un uomo slanciato che con gesti cosi rapidi quanto quelli di un uccello in volo esegue un kata della scuola shorin con tecniche dalla scintillante vivacit risultato di un allenamento intensivo i due stili sviluppano lo spirito e il corpo e luno non e migliore dellaltro essi hanno entrambi i loro punti deboli e i loro punti forti e coloro che vogliono studiare il karate devono riconoscere questi punti e studiarli di conseguenza

6316240 it is important with all the focus on london 2012 we do not neglect the needs of our winter athletes
6316241 they must be provided with the best possible support to enable them to reach their olympic aspirations
6316242 there is no doubt it will stage a stunning olympic games the setting is spectacular and the venues are inspirational
6316243 the quality of the people we met and the information available in canada lead me to believe vancouver has the potential to set new standards for the winter games
6316244 we dont know yet how he will organise his training and racing programme
6316245 bode decided to go independent but we will continue to support him as much as we can considering his new situation
6316246 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
6316247 its worse than four years ago because this time we really thought we would win
6316248 winter sports are popular in russia and our sportsmen have won many competitions and have made a big contribution to the olympic movement
6316249 but we have never won the honour to celebrate the winter olympic games
6316250 you know we can turn sports competitions into a really spectacular show and we are good at it
6316251 our view is that it is highly unlikely that there will be three european olympic games in succession
6316252 i could think of nothing greater than competing at the worlds biggest sporting event in our own backyard
6316253 i am told womens boxing could come into the games in 2012 and i would be prepared to get in a ring and fight for a medal
6316254 when sir clive presented me with the trophy we spoke at length and i was in awe of his depth of knowledge on creating leaders in world sport
6316255 he made me realise that i had almost reached the pinnacle of world skiing off my own back he also seemed surprised at the lack of science in skiing our sport is really behind in terms of using resources
6316256 the programme he put in place for our winning rugby world cup team was unlike anything i had ever heard of
6316257 from receiving or applying for any grants or subsidies whether direct or indirect from the ioc in the amount of 1m 500 000
6316258 this shows the iocs determination to fight doping with zero tolerance
6316259 i think the ioc has taken an important step in the fight against doping
6316260 the italian report showed very clearly that a great quantity of medical equipment had been seized in this apartment used by athletes
6316261 this goes from saline solution syringes bags for storing blood and many other things
6316262 some athletes gave testimony in writing some did not in evaluating all this and the explanations we came to the conclusion that these athletes committed a violation of the anti doping rules by possessing medical devices and material
6316263 this possession alone was enough to constitute an offence a violation of the code
6316264 you have to imagine athletes living in apartments during the games surrounded by blood bags and syringes all these devices means it is almost impossible that these athletes did not know what was happening
6316265 the reason i went through with the surgery on my feet was because i needed some time away from the sport
6316266 i had just lost my mother who was my number one fan and i thought it was important to sit down and reflect on things
6316267 if i hadnt have done that im one of these extremists who would have over trained so i thought it was important to step back from the sport
6316268 i took three months off and it was really good closure for me
6316269 i feel no one expects much of me from this season because i have been through such a hard time but this leaves me free with no restrictions in my head
6316270 i feel i am really skiing fast because of it
6316271 if i look back at my skiing career every time ive had to go through a hardship ive skied fast
6316272 my mum and i had the same dreams she wanted me to be the number one racer and im just going to have to use that and ski fast with it
6316273 i did the surgery to be able to ski pain free it got to the stage where the pain was really hard for me to suppress and it was getting in the way of me winning races
6316274 the moment has come for me to end my career the major reasons for that are my injuries
6316275 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones not making gestures like the one he made
6316276 lack strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture vaccines for humans
6316277 in china human rabies was largely under control in the period 1990 1996 owing to nationwide rabies vaccination programmes
6316278 the recent increase in incidence has been high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6316279 i dont really think injury can be avoided when youre playing one sport at this level
6316280 when youre doing any kind of activity repetitively over and over the way these athletes are doing its a set up for injury
6316281 i had to up my celebrex today to get through this one
6316282 you see people of 16 or 17 years old with the bones of a 60 or 70 year old
6316283 you have to be thin perfectionist driven and willing to push yourself
6316284 my body has suffered a lot of scars lots of operations my health isnt what it used to be

6316287 when youre laying in the hospital bed and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to think about next week or next month youre only thinking about the next hour
6316288 its almost the same strategy ive used here to stay in the pack to be patient and stay easy just waiting for your chance
6316289 gradually moving up to the front throughout the race van der weijden won a three way sprint by taking a more direct line to the finish skirting just inside the final red buoy to grab gold
6316290 if there is anyone in the field that can beat me that guy is an absolute legend
6316291 after the win van der weijden raised his arms in the air and pumped his fists as he walked around the dock he was hoisted on the shoulders of his teammates and pointed a finger toward to sky to show he was no
6316292 because of the treatment i got the stem cell transplants i had the luck to recover
6316293 it is pretty safe to assume that the pass rate at a and a is going to be 20 per cent or more this year
6316294 there has been a lot of effort put into improving maths standards we could be starting to see some of the fruits of that
6316295 the structure of the exams has also been changed to allow more students to have a crack at getting a c grade
6316296 young people will be getting the results that their hard work deserves and most will be inspired to stay in education or training but those that dont do as well as expected should not give up
6316297 this year there are more options than ever before for those wanting to stay in education and for those who prefer to work and learn can aim for a job that offers an apprenticeship or some form of recognised training perhaps with day release to a local college
6316298 ela era prostituta na zona sul e quando sa a com os turistas aplicava o golpe
6316299 it doesnt look to be long before china is a power in the sport the national federation has spent lots of money to organize beach volleyball in a country not known for its sand and surf
6316300 the chinese federation works very hard and they come out with a good game plan every time
6316301 they will continue to get better because they work so hard at it
6316302 and they made the americans work extremely hard for this title the 36 points they allowed were the most walsh and may treanor gave up in beijing
6316303 these girls motivate us more than i can even tell you because they are so good
6316304 coming in we knew it would come down to us and china
6316305 the chinese women are getting better and better we knew china would be going for it in these olympics

6316325 maartens had a cancer battle in the past and almost had to give up the sport
6316326 its almost like a lance armstrong story hes a complete gentleman and a great ambassador for the sport and hes olympic champion now

6316328 i think the leukaemia taught me to think step by step
6316329 when you are lying in a hospital bed and feeling tired you dont want to think about next month or next week you only think about the next hour
6316330 you have to be patient you lie in your bed and just wait i think thats almost the same strategy as i used here you stay in the pack be patient stay easy and wait for your chance
6316331 its only my third race so i knew i was going to be an open water novice in terms of the tactics and going straight
6316332 its really hard to go straight especially when your heads all over the place
6316333 my body had given everything i was having a real sugar low and i was swimming in zigzags and not knowing what was going on
6316334 thats where if i continue in the sport ill have to make improvements in my tactics and in my lines and having the patience to swim with people on top of you
6316335 i like to swim at the front in clear water and thats obviously the hardest way to do it because youre in the lead the whole way
6316336 this was the hardest two hours of my life its one thing to get to the top of an olympic sport or to get to the podium
6316337 but to stay focused for another four years and try to stay at the top of your sport especially in the endurance events that i do its really tough and thats probably what im most proud of at the moment that i kept at it for the last four years
6316338 i had some ups and downs along the way but this medal was completely unexpected this time last year
6316339 i was adamant i didnt want to do the sport i wanted to concentrate on swimming in the pool ive only done three races so its a bit of surprise and its a different feeling to the first one in athens
6316340 i feel more proud and more humble knowing how hard it is to get on the podium and the fact ive done it twice at two different olympic games now and in two different sports

6316363 the television series knight rider is a show that everyone can get hooked on i think its really cool that nbc has chosen to reinvent the series for the fall line up the best part about the show was always the car kitt and this is amazing that i get to drive a version of kitt for the night race at bristol its every guys dream to feel like they are an action hero and i get to have that chance under the lights of bristol with our no 28 knight rider ford
6316364 the stealth look and feel of the car coupled with travis kvapil at the helm has us very excited about this race
6316365 this event exemplifies the adrenalin and action the knight rider series will deliver and illustrates the strength and compatibility of our sponsor partnership with ford

6316375 the fact that theyre out here and doing it is good
6316376 it means they are both a chance they are possibilities but the key will be how they report the day after training
6316377 the injuries have to be managed because we dont want to suffer a setback and then need an operation
6316378 weve got to be sensible about it as theres still quite a bit of footy to come
6316379 thats not good for them because habana is a remarkable player
6316380 but it doesnt change our challenge and focus because we have to maximise what we bring to the game when we pick our team we wont be contemplating theirs

6316382 there was nothing we could take from the game dalbeattie were much sharper than us and were fired up for it more than we were it was so disappointing
6316383 the first half was a total disaster we never got going and dalbeattie ran over the top of us
6316384 its not good enough we need to start taking responsibility for ourselves on the park
6316385 weve had two players sent off which is two too many in my eyes discipline last season wasnt very good and its one of the things weve tried to work on this season
6316386 both sendings off have been for two bookings but they miss the next game and its not helping the squad
6316387 we just need to know that when things arent going for us we should control the aggression and put it back into the game instead of making a rash challenge
6316388 we had seven boys missing on saturday but i dont want that to be an excuse we just need to try to get a consistent team on the park and start grinding out results we know we can do it we did it last season with basically the same squad
6316389 weve got a cup game and then stranraer fc in the league every games tough and weve just got to knuckle down grind out two or three results and take it from there
6316390 i think it takes a little bit of pressure off and weve just got to give it our all on the day newton had a good result last week but got beat on saturday so theyre struggling as well its a double header which makes it more intriguing hopefully well have a few boys back
6316391 its a winner takes all game and weve just got to go out dig in roll our sleeves up for 90 minutes and hopefully get a result
6316392 if we can win cup games we can hopefully move that into the league games and give ourselves a bit of confidence
6316393 its disappointing because we didnt apply ourselves right from the beginning and its another bad defeat to a big team we had this problem last year when we played the top teams and didnt get much out of it we just need to pick ourselves up and try to string together some results
6316394 we didnt start playing until the last half hour there wasnt a lot in the game our tempo was low we should have applied ourselves better and had more desire to win the game early doors
6316395 although they went 3 0 up i wouldnt say they were dominating the game in the whole first half they had two shots on goal and a cross
6316396 the cross was a bit slack from us and gary king tried to head it clear but it went in at the near post i think we were too flat and we were chasing the game
6316397 we went into the second half with a higher tempo and then we were caught on the break at 3 0 i thought it was done and dusted but we continued to play at a higher tempo and got two back
6316398 we pressurised them and they had a man sent off with ten minutes to go and we actually looked like wed get at least a draw but time just slipped away from us
6316399 if we dont get two or three players in were probably not strong enough to win the league this time but things can change in football even at this early stage it looks like cups will be our main objective
6316400 were two maybe three players off the finished article and its not easy to get them in weve been trying and trying something might develop with teams who have a lot of players and theyre maybe not getting a game
6316401 i still think the team weve got are more than capable of giving anyone a game and if they apply themselves from the start rather than halfway through the game
6316402 i think a lot of the boys will be looking for a bit of payback
6316403 abbey vale have improved and thoroughly deserved their victory but i think itll be a different story
6316404 well be a tougher proposition than we were then and we were missing eight players

6316450 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6316451 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate

6316490 before rabbi ralbag came down we asked rabbi eisen if rabbi ralbag would be able to work with the vaad hakashrus and he said absolutely

6316497 the sheep does what it wants it goes out and comes back in the evening to sleep as is its nature but a gazelle is wild and does not normally live a domesticated life in the presence of sheep or humans shouldnt we give tremendous credit and special attention to this one who gave up an expansive wilderness and life among all the wild creatures to come and live in our yard
6316498 shouldnt we also give tremendous credit to the ger who has chosen to leave his family and his people the nations of the world to join our ranks this is why we must be very sensitive so as not to harm the ger in any way

6316516 temporization with dictators doesnt work morally or pragmatically beijing did not deserve to host the olympics the same spinelessness that gave them this honor would now have us sustain chinas honor without boycott without a loud voice raised against injustice
6316517 when after much internal debate and controversy the international olympic committee decided to allow the hitler government to host the 1936 summer games the committee promised that the prospect of hosting the games would liberalize nazi germany and even improve the situation of the jewish population in that country
6316518 despite a momentary abatement of anti semitic measures during the games themselves they resumed with redoubled fury in the late 30s
6316519 now we have the 2008 summer games taking place in beijing and once again promises by the ioc and the communist chinese to improve chinas record in human rights and in the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities have not materialized on the contrary the government has cracked down on opposition forces and dissidents to prevent any embarrassing incidents during the games moreover the successes of chinese athletes at these games are being touted in china as proof of the superiority of the chinese race it all sounds very familiar

6316582 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6316583 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6316661 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6316662 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6316663 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6316664 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now

6316672 weve raised questions throughout the process particularly in relation to the implications to the nonproliferation treaty

6316674 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement
6316675 a lot of people have raised questions and many people think the civil nuclear deal does not fit into the nonproliferation framework that is not our view
6316676 i think the presidential candidates are responsible for ensuring disclosure here
6316677 disclosure is a basic prerequisite of campaign finance laws and the only reason for not filing this information monthly would appear to be to hide the information from the public this information should not be hidden from anyone

6316683 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6316684 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6316685 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6316686 any number larger than that is an error in your math

6316692 we hold these truths to be self evident that all of us are created equal and endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life
6316693 the willingness with which young americans will serve their country in future wars is directly related to the treatment of those who have previously served and sacrificed in conflict

6316725 the secret is we really like each other we have no choice you may have had a run in with someone in a wnba season it doesnt matter at this point its a sisterhood thats what its all about
6316726 this team has the best chemistry of any olympic team ive been on
6316727 and i worried about that because we only had a few days together
6316728 we put that behind us once we wear red white and blue
6316729 we have the most national championships out of the group so we dont bring it up
6316730 doesnt count when theres only four teams in the league
6316731 we have no choice you may have had a run in with someone in a wnba season it doesnt matter at this point its a sisterhood thats what its all about

6316736 hopefully india gets more medals in olympics we will also win more games we have three more odis to go so let us see very hopeful in both segments in olympics and cricket
6316737 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening
6316738 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
6316739 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6316740 the only issue that is important for us is the safety and security of the players and the advice we get from our range of sources

6316742 another lean year lies ahead but with the 130 million rands profit of two years ago we still have enough reserves to keep the pot boiling although losses are never good news we are glad that they were not as large as originally feared
6316743 the tours to new zealand and the west indies were from a television coverage point of view not profitable at all
6316744 we could not get through the initial 45 minutes and lost four early wickets for 11 runs that changed the whole situation the batsmen will have to take the responsibility
6316745 when we went in to bat we always thought 175 would have been a great score on this wicket and that was our target we knew that we had to make sure that we dont lose too many wickets upfront keep the wickets in hand and drag the game as much as possible but we fail to execute our plans
6316746 we know badri is a talented batsman and a very busy player he batted well for a debutant we knew his abilities during the ipl he handled the situation very well he had dhoni on the other end and they rotated the strike
6316747 we did not want to risk him we have back to back games and the champions trophy coming up so we did not want to risk any serious injury it was a precautionary measure not to play him
6316748 as a result of that feedback wednesdays meeting agreed that subject to confirmation from the relevant participants teleconferences would be called of the task team on friday and the icc board on sunday
6316749 most of the times we have played in sri lanka it is not a bowlers paradise especially for the fast bowlers full credit to the fast bowlers for coming out with flying colours in tough conditions they bowled in right areas
6316750 in the last two games seamers got help but they may not get these conditions in the coming three games
6316751 it was turning a bit also so it was a bit tough when in one end we had a batsman but in other end it was open with the tailenders of course it was a concerned area till the match got over
6316752 well i am losing my hair it is a pleasure to go out there under pressure to perform that is what you are suppose to do at this level whenever you have the responsibility whenever you have the pressure they expect you to score it is a privilege to have that
6316753 your confidence level goes up you know you can deal with them you can look into the opponents eyes and say if we play good cricket we can beat you so it is all about confidence and mindset and being in positive frame of mind
6316754 badri is very talented that is why he is here he has performed over the years in domestic circuit and wherever he has gone to it was good to have him the first game he was under pressure playing against murali and mendis i think he played them very well
6316755 you dont have to get the experience of playing 100 games if you play 25 of such games it will give you the experience of 45 or 50 games the more you are in these situations the more comfortable you are in dealing with these situations in the future
6316756 it was a deceptive wicket i thought it had less grass and it may not assist the seamers but there was something for fast bowlers even for the sri lankan fast bowlers after the break of course the wicket dried up the second half was better for batting
6316757 he has got a stiff neck we have three more days and hopefully he will be fine before the next game
6316758 a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6316759 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6316760 the promise and the hope and the dream of getting to go after the medal one more time is definitely what i love
6316761 the journey living out the dream is the best part of it
6316762 this is it im going to enjoy it first or fifth or whatever place
6316763 im kinda old so we have these aches and pains
6316764 its holding its fine my last entry was great so i have to be confident that i can use it even though its sore
6316765 this is the first time ive gone to prelims with her that i didnt have a heart attack

6316779 if anything the presence of a grandfather was associated with decreased survival of grandchildren
6316780 it doesnt surprise me that men in those societies live longer than men in monogamous societies where they become widowed and have nobody to care for them

6316862 i think we are ready for the world cup qualifiers
6316863 i think we did well in the first half and put petr cech under a lot of pressure he was their best player and made three good saves
6316864 the czechs are a very good team which is why i wanted to play them they are not easy to beat
6316865 but we created chances especially in the first half and played well but we suffered when they counter attacked and this is a problem we must work on
6316866 there is no better opportunity to remind people what i have known about john all along he is a proven leader who will put country first
6316867 maybe this is a playing out of his negotiating with dictators without precondition

6316959 the one responding to questions on these issues particularly polar bears
6316960 understands the administrations position on climate change polar bears and sea ice and will not be speaking on or responding to these issues
6316961 why didnt you warn me that a polar bear was approaching
6316962 i would have to call washington for permission to mention it first

6316964 we are going to go after al qaida and the global war on terror wherever it takes us
6316965 our aim is simple just as there be no safe haven for terrorists so there be no hiding place for those who finance terrorism
6316966 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6316967 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

6316970 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

6316972 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6316973 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6316974 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6316975 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6316976 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6316977 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6316978 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6316979 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6316980 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6316981 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6316982 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6316983 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6316984 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6316985 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6316986 we are very pleased to add to our group the expertise and reputation of these two outstanding businesses the acquisitions are very complementary and further elevate our standing in the risk management arena
6316987 with the two businesses expecting to contribute a combined current year ebit of 4 3 million the greencap groups annualised activity level should be approaching total revenue of 58 million and ebit of 12 million
6316988 we are delighted to be coming on board the greencap group the greencap model of retaining the operational identity culture and management teams of acquired businesses is critically important to our company and our growth aspirations and we were very impressed with greencaps ethics integrity and commitment to assisting us
6316989 we are keen to grow the leeder business and the enhanced awareness and door opening that the greencap group can provide means we can grow our business faster as part of a national platform of specialist risk management delivery streams
6316990 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6316991 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6316992 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6316993 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6316994 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6316995 last year when i came in here i didnt know anything about the position

6316997 to say that social unequality is at the root of violence in brazil is coffee table talk
6316998 this article is clearly written by someone who believes in human rights for drug dealers
6316999 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6317000 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6317001 ich sah wie das flugzeug in mehrere teile zerrissen wurde
6317002 dann gab es eine heftige explosion ich hatte zuerst gedacht die maschine w re dabei zu landen aber dann neigte sie sich pl tzlich zur seite und bohrte sich mit der rechten tragfl che in die erde
6317003 es war alles schwarz und verbrannt die leichen waren so hei dass wir uns beim wegtragen die finger verbrannten
6317004 die leichen in den tr mmern waren verkohlt viele auch verst mmelt
6317005 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6317006 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6317007 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6317008 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6317136 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6317137 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6317138 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6317139 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6317140 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6317141 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6317142 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6317143 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6317144 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6317145 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6317146 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6317147 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6317148 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6317149 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6317150 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6317151 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6317152 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6317153 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6317154 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6317155 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6317156 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6317157 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6317158 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6317159 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6317160 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6317161 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6317162 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6317163 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6317164 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6317165 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6317166 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6317167 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6317168 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6317169 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6317170 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6317171 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6317172 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6317173 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6317174 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6317175 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6317176 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6317177 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6317178 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6317179 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6317180 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6317181 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6317187 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6317188 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6317189 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6317190 let no one suffer the illusion that 126 billion has gone straight to where it is needed and where it belongs
6317191 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6317192 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6317193 vamos almo ar eu tua m e a r e tu
6317194 traditionally and historically we think america is more reliable than europe in 1918 we regained independence thanks to the u s when world war ii began in 1939 we were let down by our allies britain and france but the u s has never failed us
6317195 no one will ever again tell poland what to do and what not to do
6317196 if poland allows elements of the u s missile shield to be placed in its territory it will expose itself to a strike and thats a hundred percent sure
6317197 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6317198 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6317211 the challenge will be to address wall streets growth and earnings expectations without shortchanging our investment in research and development and the long term future of the company
6317212 while our strategy certainly benefited the company in the past when we were not profitable i believe it is incumbent on the board and management team at myriad to revisit the strategy in light of the dynamics surrounding a profitable company
6317213 given that the company has 9 in cash per share and no debt the earnings power of the molecular diagnostic business may be enough to drive the stock to 70 near term in our view
6317214 to be fair its a small minority that really dont like the art style
6317215 a majority of the feedback weve gotten has been overwhelmingly positive about the art style i think when they see the final game theyll find its probably a bit darker than they might think what weve shown is the earliest parts of the game meant to be a little sunnier and brighter than the later because were trying to set a juxtaposition and make everything feel worse as the game move on in terms of the actual art style we went through three full art revisions where we essentially hit the reset button on all the art and started over again and one of the main reasons was when we tried to go towards what our memory of diablo ii was we found that it created a drab boring game that didnt play very well
6317216 one of the things i try to remind people who talk about the art style and what diablo ii looked like is theyre being very selective in their memory theyre remembering small parts of act i and small parts of act iii and conveniently forgetting all the green fields of act i and all of act ii which is actually one of the most popular acts the general kind of almost garish look of the monsters really made them stand out and those things made the game play really well they were actually criticized at the time when diablo ii came out it was panned for being too bright and cheerful compared to the original diablo of course the original diablo drew like little red lines around the enemies so you could actually see them
6317217 a lot of people i think would say thats a hallmark of the diablo series the potion system
6317218 it doesnt make it play like a better action game it just kind of gives the player infinite health its actually a fairly poor recovery mechanic because it forces the designers to design monsters that have to deal with a player that has infinite health the only thing you can do is have monsters that can overcome that health and essentially one shot you thats not a very interesting monster its actually a horrible monster but thats the only option the design shoehorned the designers into that kind of monster design so we focused on a health system that actually forces the player to think tactically to recover health from monsters and to put them in some situations where they are low on health but have to walk into an enemy encounter anyway that makes for a much more challenging encounter but it also makes for a situation where we can design the monsters to be a lot more interesting we actually can lower damage on monsters we want monsters to do less damage because we want them to wear you down over time and do things that are challenging in different ways

6317265 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6317266 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6317267 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6317268 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6317269 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6317270 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6317271 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6317272 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6317273 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6317274 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6317275 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6317276 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6317277 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6317278 we have a group of players who work hard for each other and they are passionate to do well
6317279 there are areas we can still improve on but we are going into it in good spirits
6317280 we have two difficult away games but hopefully we can come back with some points
6317281 it was good to see some fresh blood who can do you a job
6317282 at the moment there are still four or five players who are borderline in terms of being fit so that is going to dictate the team
6317283 we have been a bit unfortunate with injuries since i took over but there is nothing you can do about that and it gives other people opportunities
6317284 when we know whos going to be available that will give me a clearer mind about who us going to play
6317285 but it was a good workout and i was able to blood a number of new players and they all did well overall i thought we passed it quite well at times
6317286 we knew northern ireland would make it difficult for us they are a strong international side it would have been great to win but it wasnt to be
6317287 we tried james mcfadden and kenny miller up front and they maybe just lacked that little bit of cutting edge
6317288 when you are at home and you have a few chances and you put teams under pressure you are looking to put the ball in the net
6317289 we were unfortunate a couple of times not to score so it was just that lack of cutting edge that would have won us the game
6317290 there is still a bit of work to be done but they worked hard and it takes time for any partnership to form
6317291 at home you are looking to play with your two strikers and put people under pressure at times i thought they did well but there is still work to be done
6317292 its something we have to look at but they both worked their socks off and at times they did well
6317293 in the second half we were unfortunate not to get a goal it was a point blank save from about two yards from mcfadden and if it goes in then we have won the game and the partnership has worked
6317294 they are both excellent strikers and excellent players it maybe just doesnt happen overnight
6317295 there is a close call because you are talking about two top class international goalkeepers
6317296 ive said from day one we are fortunate to have that because they are both outstanding
6317297 craig gordon has been terrific for scotland so we are in a very healthy position its healthy competition
6317298 at the moment craig is the number one but allan has come in and done exceptionally well
6317299 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6317300 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6317301 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6317302 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6317303 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6317304 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6317305 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6317306 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6317307 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6317308 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6317309 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6317310 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6317311 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6317312 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6317313 true art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist
6317314 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin its looking bleak but every effort is being made
6317315 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6317316 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000 km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6317317 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6317318 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6317319 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6317320 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6317321 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6317322 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6317323 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6317324 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6317325 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6317326 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6317327 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6317328 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6317329 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6317330 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6317331 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6317332 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6317333 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6317334 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6317335 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6317336 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6317337 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6317338 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6317339 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6317340 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6317341 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6317342 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6317343 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6317344 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6317345 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6317346 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6317347 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6317348 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6317349 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

6317364 wherever terrorist attacks have taken place in the recent past rajasthan maharashtra karnataka gujarat it is the state governments that are investigating the matter it is their responsibility to submit the evidence against simi to the central government
6317365 the holy koran the governing text of human life propagation of islam and jihad in the cause of islam
6317366 true to its ideological mooring in the 80s simi produced eyecatching stickers proclaiming
6317367 it was unable to function in any manner because all its members were demoralised or had crossed the age of 30 years which automatically disentitled them to continue as a member of simi and due to lack of offices and as all its accounts were frozen some of the erstwhile members also had to fight criminal cases foisted against them by the state

6317392 he used all of his pitches his curveball and changeup were great tonight he had great location with his fastball and he kept them off balance he got a lot of ground balls and gave us what we needed
6317393 he had some trouble with his control and with a team like the yankees you cant do that

6317413 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6317414 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6317415 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans

6317422 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6317423 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6317424 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6317425 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6317426 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6317427 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6317428 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6317429 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6317430 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6317431 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6317432 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6317433 you dont know how dangerous it is and thats the scary part
6317434 theres a pretty widespread belief that this is an antiquated system

6317436 there are a number of other states that have cut their programs and are regretting it

6317439 the catfish bit just as soon as she got in the house
6317440 when you turn off front end controls word gets out
6317441 nobody knew what it was for who is responsible for that
6317442 my understanding is that the program was approved by the nccu faculty senate
6317443 i think it was well intentioned but somebody just dropped the ball in making sure it was accredited
6317444 he must be considered like jesse owens in the 1930s however he has a bigger edge over his rivals if he maintains this gap then he will be quite something
6317445 however he still has to mature he is a young man but he should show more respect for his rivals that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6317446 he should shake hands with them after the finish line however he is only 21 and he will learn i have no problems with his showboating prior to the race but a shake of the hand or a tap on the shoulder immediately after the race would be a good gesture
6317447 it would be good not to have a repeat of the catch me if you can gesture
6317448 its going to take a while for it to sink in
6317449 i gave it everything and now i have something to show for it its a once in a lifetime experience
6317450 i knew maarten finished well so i was trying to stay with him
6317451 i had to battle with the group with 700 metres to go and i lost a lot of strength in the fight to stay in the race
6317452 that cost me silver but i am happy with bronze
6317453 its the first time that i have got two cards in my career
6317454 its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6317455 but the july data indicated that the economy is not deteriorating rapidly
6317456 the outlook for the japanese economy essentially hinges on a recovery in the us economy oil prices are falling which is good news but i think it is still too early to predict the outlook
6317457 since last year we have been seeing a gradual slowdown in japans export growth the latest data confirmed this trend this is a reflection of the continued worsening of the global economy
6317458 rising prices of raw materials have affected the domestic demand of asian countries as well as the developed nations

6317473 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6317474 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6317475 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6317476 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6317477 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6317478 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what stands for and believes in

6317503 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle

6317505 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6317684 the kitchen was like nothing i had ever seen or imagined a stifling low ceilinged inferno of a cellar red lit from the fires and deafening with oaths and the clanging of pots and pans it was so hot that all the metal work except the stoves had to be covered with cloth in the middle were furnaces where twelve cooks skipped to and fro their faces dripping sweat in spite of their white caps round that were counters where a mob of waiters and plongeurs dishwashers clamoured with trays scullions naked to the waist were stoking the fires and scouring huge copper saucepans with sand everyone seemed to be in a hurry and a rage the time between eight and half past ten was a sort of delirium sometimes we were going as though we had only five minutes to live sometimes there were sudden lulls when the orders stopped and everything seemed quiet for a moment then we swept up the litter from the floor threw down fresh sawdust and swallowed gallipots of wine or coffee or water anything so long as it was wet

6317727 now all i want to do is do things and not talk i want to run around i want to have fun
6317728 and women go crazy over these types of guys some people are so scared of growing older that they become extremely aged in their youthful flesh now you will be the envy of every philosopher scholar thinker and deep analyzer you will be in the world they have no access to nothing has changed the attitude you had towards girls when you were in the sandbox is exactly the attitude you need now so think young and live
6317729 you are my life i love nothing else so well as you i will do anything for you
6317730 every guy has a passion about different things on that wall is his car passion we see many screens of different cars all ones he loves on that other wall there is his food passion we see screens of all his favorite foods and if you come along here youll find the ambition wall where screens show all the things he wants to do now look at the women wall
6317731 yes nature has designed us to love in a marriage way when there is only one picture on that wall
6317732 the problem is that he is not married or engaged to her so he is acting married to her when really they are dating or just friends
6317733 yes when a guy decides to go dating and dates only one chick at a time only one picture will appear on the wall when there is only one he is designed to think of her in a marriage way so he starts becoming afc with this girl he just talked to
6317734 so say if a guy is socially unskilled and has only one friend that is a girl only that girls picture will appear on the wall and because of that he will fall in love with his friend
6317735 exactly if there is only one f ckbuddy he will eventually want to date the girl want to become exclusive with her and turn into a total afc
6317736 then another girl is on the wall as well he cant act married if there is more than one girl up there thus he stops becoming a latent afc
6317737 but what if he has his interest in other things shouldnt he date only one girl then
6317738 no either go for many or go for none if you go for one you will become an afc most guys are too lazy or too scared to go for multiple girls so they remain afcs and forever remain in the vicious cycle
6317739 pook i recognize the young man you speak of it is
6317740 alas ive only been telling you my own recollections with every lesson here when i condemn the young man i am only condemning myself let us continue
6317741 the zest of life is the rattle of dice in the cup
6317742 monsieur pook how much are you willing to bet on the throw of your dice
6317743 but if you do that you may lose all your property all your society and all your time and thus your life are you willing to bet all that on your talent dreams and endurance
6317744 the greatest risk you can take in life is not to risk it all
6317745 you can be the smartest person in the world the most talented the most persistent but you will never win in the world or with women unless you embrace the glory of risk
6317746 but pook i am scared of risk what if i lose
6317747 you cannot lose everyone wants to define your life to shape it to their ends from politicians to your friends everything is all right as long as you stay you but if you break out of the mold everyone and i do mean everyone will try to stop you
6317748 just as on the battlefield the valiant warrior losing in glorious battle is honorable it is not the victory that defines the man it is the fight there are some people who somehow have this curse or bad luck and must eat an excrement sandwich everyday they win everytime they struggle against that
6317749 so to risk is to fight then all this knowledge and insights are merely the sword shield armor and weapons we fight with and those who fight unarmed are more worthy than those who sit there completely clad with the finest of weapons
6317750 yes paradise spoken slowly is literally a pair of dice gamble what you have for if you bury your talent and dreams to sit on it you will receive the wrath of heaven unworthy servant will be screamed at you
6317751 but what if the situation itself seems impossible what if all odds seem against you what happens then
6317752 i dont want to talk to you you are too ugly
6317753 cancelling shows is never an easy decision and we apologise to all our fans friends and family for not being there to throw down with you
6317754 questa notizia a questo proposito mi stavo giusto chiedendo perch scrivo in questo blog ne far presto un post di questa riflessione ma evidentemente per condividere una notizia bisogna sapere ci che si dice a questo punto le alternative erano due
6317755 if only there was a way to avoid the painful trials ahead
6317756 i will guide you the constant heartbreak the loneliness the feeling of having no control these can be avoided follow me and i will show you many of the lessons that must be learned
6317757 would it not be better to throw myself into initial error is not error the best way to success
6317758 no your heart does not need to be shattered to realize its lessons do successful marriages come from a series of failed ones of course not for
6317759 she is out of my league she would never go for someone like me
6317760 change is gradual before you saw no opportunities now you see them all about you yet you are too hesitant to take them youre slowly becoming more aware
6317761 when you find yourself hesitant always yield to action if you see her do not wait gawk or wait for a perfect moment action action action
6317762 pook i cannot you see i am insecure i dont have that confidence
6317763 you are confusing cause and effect the cause of your hesitant nature is not because of your insecurity you have not gotten what youve wanted what youve desired that is the cause of your hesitant nature
6317764 you are caught in the vicious cycle you are hesitant because you are not used for things going your way and things will never go your way because you remain hesitant you see what you want become hesitant and the door of opportunity closes it happens again and again and again with each choice towards inaction you reject yourself a little bit more
6317765 this is where that cycle of hesitation leads in your world of hesitation you shred off more and more of your manliness until you turn into a full fledged nice guy then you seek to remove hesitation by making the approach
6317766 if there is a choice between less pain or the possibility of more pain we default to the less pain in adolescence going for a girl and failing made you think everyone else would laugh at you whether or not it was true you thought it was true this was how you were kept within the cycle
6317767 by realizing that the choice of inaction is more painful than action childhood is over you are the man you must approach always default to action now from those of us who wasted years in that hesitation mode know that rejection is always better than regret always
6317768 they do not know how great you are you are beautiful lovely enchanting dazzling in every way and they are idiots when they cannot see it
6317769 let me tell you more of my problems with men
6317770 i thought that through friendship love would eventually spring how wrong i was a friend she sees a friend you be
6317771 but why pook why is friendship hopeless i fall in love with my female friends do they not do the same
6317772 oh woman pray tell why do you not go after your male friends
6317773 yes my male friends constantly fall in love with me
6317774 and speak truly madam what do you and your male friends do
6317775 why it is a difference between the sexes young man what do you do with your friends
6317776 but do you and your guy friends ever sit around and talk about your feelings and things going on in your life
6317777 there is your answer men do not get together and just talk we do things when we are with our women friends we talk much more since we reserve our talking sharing emotions and experiences to our romantic interest we get confused with our female friends we begin to get interested in them because of this
6317778 women usually arent used to getting together and doing pure action so when they do so with their guy friends they get a bit confused as well
6317779 so avoid the friendship route when you see a woman you are interested in go for her romantically for a friend she sees a friend you shall always be
6317780 it is all women mother nature herself this nasty sphinx devours all hearts and lives of those who cannot answer her riddle that man in the picture he figured out the riddle to woman thus he became known as don juan
6317781 is that there is no riddle woman is a sphinx with no secret it is only our minds that we assign her secrets mysteries pedestals and goddess like status
6317782 look at the above example look at how the lad got stood up over and over and yet over and over he rationalized the standing up how often is it that a lad rationalizes signals to his liking how often is it that a lad offers gifts and treasures as sacrifices to her goddess likeness for in his mind she is a goddess how often is it that a lads overactive imagination converts her disrespect her shallowness her flaws into love
6317783 exactly judge by her actions and not by her words judge by what she does than by what your mind wants to see our vanity will convert the image of every disinterested girl into secretly loving us for women tell us what we want to hear this is why we must judge by her actions and not by her words
6317784 i will be patient and let the cards fall where they may
6317785 how can patience be confidence isnt confidence courage isnt confidence action how is patience courageous or action
6317786 now let us summon up a don juan and observe his mannerisms
6317787 hear me oh don juan there are women around and other men are hitting on them what is your reaction
6317788 these other guys are going to take his women how can he be so laid back
6317789 he is laid back because he knows how great a catch he is and that getting women is easy he knows he is the prince
6317790 i should have kissed her i have been following philosophies and not being myself i should follow my inner nature and
6317791 why the food is right in front of him his nose smells it his eyes see it he drools
6317792 and so is the same with women what does the kid do next
6317793 his senses all tell him to do so he knows when to eat because the food has been all prepared has been cooked and is presented before him
6317794 and so is it the same with women they have been prepared through decades of aging and growth for this purpose they dream it they want it oh heavens do they want it they have been warmed through your fun through your attention through their desire through your desire they are presented through themselves do you think she is wearing what she does for herself no she is wearing it for you women are not ornaments to be admired they are there to be consumed you know it they know it
6317795 nature has a system in place no philosophy in the world can do you any good the philosophies that supposedly work are the ones that best match natures music you either can flow with the system and get what you want or you can buck it in pain so listen to that gut
6317796 it is because they dont know how good you are
6317797 the only constant is i what if it is something i keep doing
6317798 why am i acting like a beggar i am smart handsome have a future and women ought to work to get me
6317799 goody that means i get to be passive to continue to indulge in my vaporous habits and not do a thing to alter myself i like to hear that because it means i am perfect as i am and ought not change for anyone
6317800 foolish youth if you are not changed by life then you are not living life only those who are not altered by life are those totally unaware of it
6317801 before us are two youths who are on the threshold of life both have the same origins yet the destinations are different let us look at the first one
6317802 i cherished her i bought her flowers everyday i sang her sonnets i always told her i loved her
6317803 he was after all just being himself now for the second young man
6317804 that they are stuck in a type of stasis i have changed they acknowledge that but they are exactly the same
6317805 the second one is always getting better the first one is always staying the same if not getting worse
6317806 exactly it is the difference between rotting and ripening be the good fruit be the prize to be won
6317807 i need to do this and this at work today it would be wonderful if you would go get the supplies for me
6317808 by pleasing her whims i lost track of mine a servant youll be a friend shell see as
6317809 im not equipped to answer such a question let us ask a great philosopher
6317810 attention socrates you have been summoned did you know that answer the question that is respect
6317811 thats an easy one pook where there is reverence there is fear but there is not reverence everywhere that there is fear because fear presumably has a wider extension than reverence
6317812 oh wise sage salient soul respect is the realization of set boundaries after all how can reverence become without any sense of fear of you walking away for true passion with women can only come when the man can easily walk away the great catch walking away is womans great fear
6317813 yes now let us ask a question to that opposite sex arise woman
6317814 answer this riddle why do men who are willing to walk away turn you on
6317815 didnt everyone know this a man that can walk away means that he has his pick of the litter and the woman can easily be replaced you wont find the lawyer or doctor or politician be entangled to a woman at first
6317816 so the great catch is always willing to walk away
6317817 the great catch is respect she is supposed to celebrate life with you not use you as a peon be a man and respect attends to itself
6317818 are entirely sexual creatures they do not respond to your intellectualism they do not respond to your genius they only respond to sexuality
6317819 most men are scared of their sexuality look at the chumps they are not men they are androgynous they are ape like
6317820 the woman has invited the nice guy to her pleasure palace
6317821 why he is not being male he is not being what he is enough
6317822 here the nice guy is leeching off the woman in a pathetic friendship way
6317823 what mr nice guy no way he could never have a penis
6317824 what do you want a relationship with a girl to be about
6317825 do you want to talk about dna or genetics all day
6317826 then stop talking to her about dna and genetics stop talking to her about geek things you do not need another lab partner
6317827 then embrace your own sexuality be a guy talk like a guy act like a guy do action things it is one thing to talk about things you love but most guys talk about things just to talk
6317828 sexualize myself my appearance and my actions and the women will naturally follow
6317829 when you have that connection with someone that warm safe and comfortable feeling right there then what sometimes can happen is
6317830 guides you shall learn and memorize the booklets of societal situations with women
6317831 thou shall never stay on the phone longer than twenty minutes
6317832 these guides and rules were a clutch for my lack of confidence they do however work but are overall limited
6317833 the rules and guides are the training wheels the helper out of the nest
6317834 if the rules and guides were successful why would he abandon them
6317835 because he realized he was successful not by the rules and guides but by the approaching and fun mindset the rules and guides demanded
6317836 nothing but it is critical to realize the purpose of scripts and guides
6317837 the point of manual is not to grant you success if you do you will forever be under his dictatorship the entire reason why manual exists is to not grant you success but illustrate the means of success
6317838 meaning that a few people became successful and formed manual out from the clay of their knowledge manual is their automaton their robot to consistently answer newbies questions the end goal in seduction in success is to make it natura l when it becomes natural you have no need for manual and can handle anything women throw at you
6317839 i used to think women were nice and charming that only bad boys were the problem this knowledge is shattering every ideal i held about women
6317840 but i am myself i will never change for anybody
6317841 you do not have muscles what makes you think you can get hot women
6317842 you are not that smart why do you think you can get the pick of the group
6317843 you do not have a high paying job why do you think you deserve a hottie
6317844 you are not as cute or handsome as the other guys therefore you do not deserve a hot chick
6317845 and so long as you think so long you remain free
6317846 but pook what are you a self improvement seminar where is the woman in this
6317847 women come and go but you are forever the focus must be on you what do you want in a girl what do you want to do for a date what type of relationship are you looking for it is a machine to the one you push the button and out she comes
6317848 but pook what if she does not like your date ideas what if she is different from what you are looking for
6317849 then she is not for you the thing girls hate is when you cannot have a date idea which happens to guys because they want to please her without thinking of themselves you have a series of hobbies and tastes if she likes your date ideas then that is good if she doesnt then go get another girl there are billions out there
6317850 only if you place the focus on the woman if you do that then you actually believe it is women who are making the choice not you there is no rejection you are merely finding out if she has good taste after all she is looking for a guy that fits her interests and tastes if she doesnt like you for whatever reason let her and thank her for doing so
6317851 which would you prefer a woman who collapses her own interests for the sakes of yours merely to have a boyfriend or a woman who likes you because of you
6317852 indeed now think back to your nice guy days those suffering days of endless agreement and non confrontation what service did you do to help find compatibility
6317853 look into the valley look at how man has fallen
6317854 everything would be much simpler if they werent female and would logically make sense
6317855 indeed they are not just female but so annoyingly female
6317856 what you are still single oh poor guy you will one day progress and get a chick like us
6317857 i just got a new girlfriend and you are still single hah
6317858 we all are married or have girlfriends but you poor chap are still single
6317859 give the woman flowers chocolate poetry declarations of love your full attention your promises your exclusiveness your time your dreams your life and adopt her desires her plans her manipulations and her designs on your future
6317860 most guys still think like women they think that by sleeping with lots of women by having a girlfriend or by having a wife means they are successful with women
6317861 you mean that beggars cant be choosers you mean for guys to pick the girl rather than the other way around
6317862 youre closer and that is true but women date for all sorts of reasons they marry for all sorts of reasons they sleep with you for all sorts of reasons to the addition of the above you want to find a woman that is interested in you
6317863 oh poor thing you will get a girl like me one day
6317864 the error is guys defining their success on having a woman or women they should rather be concerned with having a woman that does actually like them
6317865 why do you say this pook it sounds like a bit more work
6317866 yes but if you do this then you wont be like the following
6317867 she said she loved me and we got married why does she want a divorce now
6317868 all my friends thought she was a keeper so why is she cheating on me with her ex
6317869 she wont return my repeated calls what is going on
6317870 i do her date ideas and she thought i was boring what does that mean
6317871 when you aim at something long term you need to make sure the woman like you just because she dates you sleeps with you and yes even marries you does not mean she likes you
6317872 you define what the dates are at first she will work with you if she likes you you can soften up later like in a couple of months if she starts breaking dates giving you the run around or seems inflexible then that should be warning signs that she doesnt like you
6317873 i see but what if youre so awful at djing that no woman likes you
6317874 then youll have more free time with your buddies success cannot be getting a girl because that means failure is being alone no failure is being in an unhappy marriage or a relationship where she has no true interest in you
6317875 so the focus must be on you including her interest
6317876 right drop the getting a girl is success mantra and you will never be dumped
6317877 what are you cruel voice your words like daggers in my heart
6317878 then you are not valiant for you fear the pointed tip like a soft worm i am you your inner self your own imagination and if you like soul by caging me your successes with women will spike with increasing frustration
6317879 what you are the one that is spreading this emptiness through my body like a virus
6317880 you craven dismal dreaming miscreant you know you are now getting what you desired women so why are you so unhappy
6317881 but i had to change because i wasnt getting the women
6317882 and you failed because by keeping me caged you limit yourself
6317883 indeed like a heaven over us the ladies in womaniverse watch us over yes they always notice you they look at your life and reward the men of the world with the feminine element
6317884 oh no some get virgin material while the fools get common ore
6317885 what else can you tell me of this feminine element
6317886 it is highly relaxing very ornamental in sports cars explodes and freezes for no reason and reacts well to gold platinum or any of the precious metals it also turns green when placed near superior specimens
6317887 what are you saying pook that how we are the rock in their world that they are the rock an element of ballast for us in this universe
6317888 oh silly youth these thoughts are too feathery and fluff at nothingness in your dimension dont think of it only read the letter
6317889 rarely usually women speak in so we men dont hear anything anyway but being a dutiful pook an emissary myself i have translated the letter to masculine terms
6317890 thank heavens now i see why its in 19th century style
6317891 look at me i am the object and axis of your world my whims become your laws what you enjoy today including your tastes in food women and cars will be dictated by me i alone will frame the world you live
6317892 because it was the truth why do you let people mold and shape your life your life is going in circles because you cannot tear yourself from your loser friends or stupid entertainment keep reading the letter
6317893 if one day you actually get the chance to enter womaniverse youll be even more amazed
6317894 is to unite your dream and day it is the only way
6317895 this is the most sexist thing i have ever heard
6317896 you doubtful youth you are a beanstalk cynic a crusty philosopher
6317897 look when we were young we all desired to grow up now once grown up we desire to be young again being poor you trade your time and health for money only to use that money for time and health we have all passed through the world of a child
6317898 are you saying that i ought to be child like
6317899 yes young kids lacking the chemical madness curse that puberty brings us are at perfect ease and treat the sexes appropriately no young boys will say whatever you want to do young boys run around they do not sit and talk to the girl all night young boys have their cars their trucks their dangers and excitements now compare the young boys actions to those who are really successful with women
6317900 they are identical i always thought women were immature for going after these so called jerks bad boys and jocks i see that in some ways they are immature but they kept that joy of youth with them whereas i had killed it
6317901 why i speak to her about philosophy about literature about the designs on the universe about dna about world events about

6317916 this was not a blunder as we do not enforce the return of sex offenders and he was entitled to a passport
6317917 we deal with sex offenders rigorously and effectively here and we prevent those here who present a risk of going overseas but it is not our policy to force them all to return to live in the united kingdom
6317918 weve been kissing for a half hour and your hand keeps grazing my ass thats nice but its time to move forward get on top of me
6317919 after a day of exchanging dirty e mails my boyfriend called to tell me he couldnt wait for me to get home that night
6317920 i expected him to attack me the second i walked through the door but instead i found him waiting in the bedroom with about 30 candles lit he handed me a glass of wine rose no less and then proceeded to strum his guitar and sing a song hed written for me i prayed i was having some kind of waking nightmare but no it was real
6317921 i once asked my boyfriend what his favorite thing was the i did sexually
6317922 he said i love the way you hold me he might as well have tucked his junk between his legs while he was saying it
6317923 its my boyfriends attitude during rougher sex that turns me on the most
6317924 hes more demanding he flips me around in different positions he talks dirty
6317925 turn over so i can look at your ass while we do it
6317926 honeybear would you mind turning on your tummy so we can do it from behind please
6317927 not so hard that it leaves a hand print but hard enough that it stings a little
6317928 i once had a guy tap my ass cheek like he was absent mindedly keeping the beat to a song on his steering wheel
6317929 if youre gonna do it for the love of god go for it
6317930 my boyfriend does it when im giving him head or when hes doing me from behind
6317931 theres nothing that kills a mood faster than having a guy struggle to get my pants off apologizing and giggling like a seventh grader
6317932 just pull my bra down dont even bother taking it off push my panties aside its kind of awesome having sex with some clothes on except for socks
6317933 i need to just be grabbed and fucked really hard to get off
6317934 some girls like gentle lovemaking where the guy enters really slowly and moves rhythmically but its not for me
6317935 i enjoy foreplay but if im really horny it can actually be distracting
6317936 i slept with a guy who used to be really fat and still had body issues so he refused to take his shirt off in bed if i even tugged at it hed get upset
6317937 my old boyfriend cried once after sex because he said it was so good
6317938 every time we finished sex my ex would curl up like a fetus and ask me to spoon him i never got to be spooned not even once looking back i cant believe i fucked that guy repeatedly
6317939 an ex was supposed to pull out during sex and he didnt when i freaked he said he was trying to get me pregnant so i wouldnt leave him

6317959 as a muslim myself i feel islam has recently been saddled with an image problem quite unfairly in my opinion so i wanted to twist this around to ask the real questions about religion in secular society
6317960 i wanted to know what lengths i needed to go to to get non muslims to see islam in a good light and ask whether islam does sit comfortably in britain today
6317961 as a muslim myself it is important that people see that islam isnt an oppressive obsolete or an unintelligent way of life and that muslims arent always the problem
6317962 when i started i remember being told by a wise old sage that ideas are currency in tv so keep generating incongruous ideas but dont think too hard about them also become a superhack and persist i have been told i am nicely pushy but i dont think thats a bad thing
6317963 are we going to let a little white sign stop us
6317964 its still under investigation and we wont be able to say who was at fault until the accident reconstruction is finished
6317965 both of his air bags did deploy but he was thrown to the passenger side of his vehicle
6317966 its a whole other day my last jump doesnt even matter
6317967 the track is so fast that a lot of people have had to adjust to it
6317968 i ended up getting all of the board on my second qualifying jump
6317969 if she does that right shes going to get to 23 feet
6317970 her mother is like a coach brittney is going to listen to her mother before she listens to anybody
6317971 my approach is to basically take it one jump at a time
6317972 its preventable yes but we know it is here to stay
6317973 sex is a normal function and it is going to continue even with increased disease risk its a normal thing for people to do pregnancy before marriage and sexually transmittable diseases will continue unless there is a vaccine or a really good treatment that helps early so hiv cant be transmitted were going to continue to see this disease
6317974 were about in the middle of the pack with our hiv disease rate compared to the rest of the country
6317975 but if youre looking at race african americans are the race most disparately affected here
6317976 we still understand there are issues but i do want to say something about the progress
6317977 i remember what it looked like right after the storm i remember what it looked like the first anniversary right after the storm and i remember what it looked like last year
6317978 are people still wondering about their future absolutely you still have other issues to deal with but things are better here on the gulf coast of mississippi
6317979 it was a good casual meeting about what needs to be done
6317980 what he wanted to do i think was to have an opportunity to meet and connect with local people who dealt with the storm
6317981 we are nine days away from the third year since the largest natural disaster that ever hit this country
6317982 we have been delayed in our rebuilding and we need to rebuild for our residents we need to rebuild for our children and our senior citizens

6318102 the very changes that are taking place in the concept of privacy will be a matter that parliaments have to address and courts
6318103 the widespread availability of communications technologies that allow individuals to publish information about themselves that can be accessed by others is unprecedented in our society
6318104 people are only now beginning to understand the privacy implications of social networking sites and user generated content it may be that the pendulum will swing away somewhat from the great enthusiasm for disclosure that we are seeing now

6318118 we had to deliver some whats in it for me focusing on the key functions capture search and sharing
6318119 staff can now search any document format from a single repository previously people couldnt search both email and networks drives at the same time trim context also provides more powerful searches including deep searches into email attachments
6318120 the new system provides better re use of information by breaking down the silos of information that previously existed and making it easier to find information a few months ago we captured about 2 000 records a day now it is 4 000
6318121 our backups used to run from friday night into saturday morning then saturday afternoon there was no information lifecycle management
6318122 it were keen to delete information from the network but found it difficult knowing what could be deleted by using trim we are now classifying the information and retention and disposal schedules are automatically applied so we can see which records are at the end of their lifecycle

6318127 thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
6318128 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting

6318232 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6318233 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6318234 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6318235 thats going to have some serious consequences at the retail level

6318244 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6318245 were still trying to spread the gossip three consecutive bowl games could do that
6318246 we talk about trying to make that wf stand for something
6318247 two consecutive bowl games doesnt do that you need 10 in a row 20 in a row like your big programs
6318248 that things have changed were not a bad football program that were respected
6318249 we dont want to be a team that has a few good years and just fades away
6318250 wed like to be seen as a good program that every year is expected to win
6318251 in the acc it was always a couple teams and it wasnt wake forest

6318276 no one will ever again tell poland what to do and what not to do
6318277 if poland allows elements of the u s missile shield to be placed in its territory it will expose itself to a strike and thats a hundred percent sure
6318278 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6318279 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6318280 very pleased with the scientology volunteer program and with their address to study

6318297 a stellar 25 year pro life voting record in the congress
6318298 as a catholic journalist i think that catholics and all people deserve an explanation for certain claims that are made by the mccain campaign
6318299 so why does the catholic outreach pamphlet say that john mccain has a stellar pro life voting record in congress
6318300 reprogrammed adult cells display this embryonic characteristic they form fatal tumors in adults
6318301 even when they overcome the problems of using fetal tissue to make ips cells the cells still wont help anyone only adult stem cells are helping people now and only adult stem cells will help people in the future its all about the patients
6318302 while embryonic stem cell research advocates argue that we should make use of extra embryos the bitter bitter irony is that human embryonic stem cells cannot be used at all because they form tumors and lack essential properties needed to maintain mature tissues thus it is a waste of taxpayer dollars to fund human escr
6318303 human embryonic stem cell research is equivalent to abortion because in both cases innocent human beings are killed
6318304 it is inconsistent for john mccain to claim to be pro life and not protect human embryos from experimentation and death claims that mccain is orthodox pro life in opposing abortion but that embryonic research is relatively new and thus need not be seriously addressed are unacceptable
6318305 congress is poised to override the bush standard and push for federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research that involves the deaths of countless human beings in addition to those who are already dying in private research
6318306 discomfort with the notion of extracting stem cells from embryos is understandable but we hope congress will override the presidents veto of the stem cell research enhancement act
6318307 americans should protect innocent human beings at every stage of development and ability and we need a president who realizes this
6318308 i know theres disagreement we had several callers who were concerned about mccains support for embryonic stem cell research im against it im not panicking on the subject because i think john is warm and wonderful and humble and open and right down the line on the rights of the vulnerable i think well get there

6318312 i was ashamed to come home to indianapolis they were going to have a parade for me things were lined up for me in hollywood the pressure was extremely high and then oh there goes the rest of my life
6318313 we had a 30 minute layover in hawaii on the way home from the games and i stayed three months
6318314 technically she was very solid she just had a little lack of mental toughness
6318315 i knew she could win she just had to set her mind to it
6318316 my coach was really proud of me for listening to him for not going with my instincts
6318317 i cant blame anybody i was just being a perfect student by listening to my coach
6318318 i met so many of the wrong people the wrong influences
6318319 i believe in the grace of god and strong will just believing and pushing on
6318320 at this point in my life ive been through it all but my arms are always open because the lord will be forgiving me so im always forgiving toward everyone now
6318321 martial arts took a big cut of my time the coaches didnt really like us dating because they thought it was distracting
6318322 they wanted us to keep our mental game in focus
6318323 thats kind of sad isnt it i was married to my sport for 11 years
6318324 but a lot of my friends remind me that i made the u s olympic team and a lot of people cant say that
6318325 fay is still a threat and we are watching this very closely
6318326 this is a serious catastrophic event particularly for southern brevard county this area is seeing historic levels of rain
6318327 we are moving more resources in to support the most heavily impacted counties
6318328 the most significant issue regarding the slow motion is that fay will likely continue to dump torrential rains along its path and will probably be remembered as a very wet storm
6318329 the floodwaters are getting so high people cant drive in or out
6318330 these counties are currently in the process of harvesting these crops and rainfall produced from fay may jeopardize the entire crop
6318331 brevard will most likely receive a record amount of rainfall stressing sewer and water treatment facilities until flood levels recede
6318332 i am glad that it is acknowledged that brian died from a hospital acquired infection brian was a healthy young man going in to hospital and unfortunately he came out in a box
6318333 he was a great lad he was opinionated and argumentative funny witty and bright time will tell where he got it the infection i will have to think about whether to take it further
6318334 it is not that i want to blame anyone for what happened to brian but it is important to get some accountability for what happened to him so many people go in to hospital with minor ailments i do feel that if brian had not contracted mrsa he would be here today
6318335 i had got him a new wheelchair accessible vehicle which he was delighted with and he had got his own power chair so he had his own wheels
6318336 i feel sad for him that he did not get the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of having gone through a difficult and painful operation

6318343 we have a large volume of patients that we can now track along with their treatment
6318344 this registry allows us to track that treatment and how well they are progressing
6318345 the doctors can document and follow treatment through these consolidated reports
6318346 the patients can use that information to track their own treatment progress
6318347 patients can look up that information on the coalitions web site
6318348 its never been possible before to provide that aggregate data to the health management coalition so they can then say yes you are doing a good job

6318357 were still trying to spread the gossip three consecutive bowl games could do that
6318358 we talk about trying to make that wf stand for something
6318359 two consecutive bowl games doesnt do that you need 10 in a row 20 in a row like your big programs
6318360 that things have changed were not a bad football program that were respected
6318361 we dont want to be a team that has a few good years and just fades away
6318362 wed like to be seen as a good program that every year is expected to win
6318363 in the acc it was always a couple teams and it wasnt wake forest
6318364 this year will maybe prove the point if there were any doubters that every year the championship has to go through wake forest
6318365 there is more excitement than i have seen in 16 years
6318366 we may not have had this type of momentum consistent excitement about our football program since peahead walker back in the 1940s
6318367 there is a sense of pride that comes from beating the champs
6318368 we know we were a different team four years ago and they were a different team
6318369 of course but effort is not going to be enough
6318370 playing a great game is not going to be enough a lot of things are going to have to blend in together to have an opportunity to win but were going to try
6318371 im glad my duke team doesnt have to play st marys next year

6318374 if it is a great distance we will certainly go back in with joe cutcliffe said
6318375 the guy has unusual ability is truly a long range field goal kicker
6318376 you can live with that percentage in field goal range and 100 percent on extra points cutcliffe said
6318377 id hate to have to play against our offense in a real game itd drive me completely crazy trying to figure out whats coming next
6318378 i sure dont understand how it all works the way it does
6318379 im very surprised i have been with mikael basically all the time ive been in the first team squad
6318380 he is a great professional and it is sad to see him go but he has not been playing many games at the moment and he wants to play so all the best to him
6318381 if he wants to go im sure it will be good for him as long as he is happy with it and plays games
6318382 sex and menopause whats age got to do with it

6318385 of course i would the devil has had that money long enough
6318386 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6318387 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as pullovers and jackets made of cashmere wool
6318388 we did some work on it today it loosened up a little bit
6318389 i wouldnt have been able to do it if i would have had to put my feet on the floor
6318390 we didnt get home until 3 oclock in the morning
6318391 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6318392 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6318393 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6318394 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6318395 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6318396 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6318397 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6318398 this 915 000 grant made possible through the leadership of the general assembly is allowing us to protect waterfront land and preserve it for public use
6318399 in addition thanks to this collaboration with the n c division of marine fisheries which administers the fund well be able to make significant improvements expand the uses of this property and ensure continued access to our states public waters
6318400 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones as well as the permit application process were no more than a show
6318401 the record speaks for itself in addition to retaliatory actions despite numerous applications made no approvals for demonstrations have been reported
6318402 he broke the 100 meter record the 200 meter record like michael jackson said hes bad the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6318403 hes a great athlete and to win eight gold medals is great im on the track and hes in the water so you cant compare
6318404 i mean come on youve seen it its ridiculous hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6318405 that would mean ill go home with the gold not the way i want to go home with it but if three people stepped out thats a gold medal for me
6318406 the most impressive athletic performance ive ever seen in my life
6318407 that number was my first silver crown number my first usac midget win at indianapolis raceway park so thats a very special number to me and thats definitely cool
6318408 ive been looking at some aston martins and some maseratis it would be pretty sweet to get an old school aston martin some of the old school james bond ones
6318409 and itll definitely be the biggest game of my career so far
6318410 i feel good i took batting practice threw and hit im excited to play cuba i think its going to be another great game
6318411 this jersey represents what new orleans is style and class
6318412 it really is tough to figure out why elephants would need to count
6318413 weve fished together for eight years and it is our first outright win
6318414 we went to the same spots in the same order at about the same time and had results pretty close to day one
6318415 kings are trash fish to people down there you should see the size of the tuna they dont fish for kings unless theres a tournament going on
6318416 to avoid the rush sportsmen can go to the agencys web site to purchase a hunting or fishing license for immediate use

6318419 if its russell wilson maybe well take him out and put daniel in just so wilson can settle down and look at the defense
6318420 i cant answer that now but ive done it before
6318421 hes not hurt any more than anybody else has been
6318422 i still had the lead but that changed the momentum
6318423 in a way that took a little pressure off me because people dont expect me to win
6318424 i played solid the first two days but i still havent putted very well
6318425 the only long putt i made was the one at no 18 otherwise wednesday was just a total scramble
6318426 he probably wont be able to handle the puck or shoot the puck but he can get in all the skating drills
6318427 were really excited about him he has such a high skill level
6318428 help us restore function to the disabled and fight disease can also be used to bring in the brave new world in which what it means to be human made in the image of god is fundamentally lost
6318429 blending human nature and machine nature through such means as the implanting of brain chips for memory skills or communication could compound both the intelligence and the wealth of a small segment of society
6318430 to a new feudalism in which power of all kinds is concentrated in the hands of enhanced persons
6318431 at the heart of the agenda for the 21st century lies the need to build a policy framework in which ethical principles set the ground rules for our use of these new powers
6318432 by prohibiting the release of mute swans into the public waters of north carolina we believe that over the long term the likely negative impacts of mute swans to native aquatic vegetation and wildlife species will be minimized
6318433 furthermore the required pinioning of mute swan released on private ponds will help ensure that these birds do not subsequently move from their release location
6318434 biofuel policies are actually helping to accelerate climate change and deepen poverty and hunger rich countries demands for more biofuels in their transport fuels are contributing to spiralling production and food inflation
6318435 the evidence about the damage of mandatory targets is overwhelming and we strongly urge the australian government to ensure that these targets for biofuels are not adopted in australia such targets would only serve to put pressure on agricultural land in developing countries
6318436 even if the entire worlds supply of grains and sugars were converted into ethanol tomorrow in the process giving the world less to eat we would only be able to replace 40 per cent of our petrol and diesel consumption
6318437 rich country governments should not use biofuels as an excuse to avoid urgent decisions about how to reduce their unfettered demand for petrol and diesel
6318438 there is something wrong i found my daughters car today it smells like theres been a dead body in the damn car

6318443 this time last year was one of the sweetest spots in aviation
6318444 the business particularly at the leisure end is soft and there is a downturn i know there are real issues out there
6318445 the fuel price and the slowing economy out there are having a dampening effect
6318446 the biggest determinant in this industry without a doubt is fuel and who would know where fuel could be in three years time
6318447 they benefited from a lot of fuel hedging that was in place and that was how they were able to maintain a solid profit
6318448 the choice of growing one brand or the other depending on market conditions gives us huge flexibility
6318449 the board will make a decision in september and it will be subject to market conditions
6318450 we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned
6318451 ugandans can get online and ask questions of australians and teach australians about life in the camps with first hand accounts

6318465 maybe it happened for a reason you cant go back and think about it now you cant change things so im just looking forward
6318466 he said i probably was already punished enough by larry bird and them calling indiana and not being able to go to the league and it affecting me lawson said
6318467 i lost i dont know what to say my dreams are crushed
6318468 vahs has excellent immunisation rates and reports consistently show an average of 91 per cent of children are fully immunised
6318469 this compares with 85 4 per cent of children across inner melbourne and rates of less than 50 per cent for aboriginal children across victoria
6318470 we are an organisation that is working every day to close the gap on aboriginal health and life expectancy and we do it on a small budget
6318471 the day is a celebration of what vahs is achieving many aboriginal people will already know this but the broader community is largely unaware the open day is chance to learn about key health issues first hand
6318472 i mean im excited and have an unbelievable feeling inside but overall it hasnt sunk in its incredible

6318506 with the minimum being suspension for the remainder of the season for those involved including our two nationwide series crew chiefs
6318507 there will also be an additional monetary fine beyond the amount announced by nascar which will be the responsibility of those involved
6318508 as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6318509 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6318510 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6318511 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6318512 that was eight years of awesomeness and family support and love

6318533 we believe they may be released now anytime within next two weeks to one month

6318537 i believe shes looking down from above and wondering where all the common sense has gone
6318538 ellreese is not in charge of the fire or the wind and thats what killed them
6318539 he believed everything they told him about safety being job no 1 he believed they were covering him
6318540 the judge clearly understood that ellreese was not responsible for the deaths of these four persons we are truly grateful that the judge understood that even if the government didnt
6318541 i would kind of consider staples a one issue fringe candidate
6318542 its very important the county seat remain here in prosser
6318543 i think it indicates the voters are totally dissatisfied with the three county commissioners and they want to clean house and im going to help them do it
6318544 i am surprised that those lies had an effect on the election outcome
6318545 it indicates to me theres a lot of miscommunication that needs to be clarified
6318546 i dont think it necessarily means anything at this point
6318547 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
6318548 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains
6318549 if the drought concern is great enough and we cant get the numbers to add up that might have to be considered
6318550 folks will have to work a lot more numbers from a lot more different places before i get too worried about that one being in there
6318551 we understand anything of this magnitude will take a collective effort when you start talking about a tax assessment we put on another hat
6318552 we would have to look thoroughly and extensively at what is being requested
6318553 this is not a mad rush to get this into the halls of congress this is an effort to get everyone talking before we go there
6318554 the only way to make a dramatic step forward is we need everyone together right now they are all over the place
6318555 adversely impact our local residents who suffer from long term pain
6318556 dr martinez is a dedicated caring physician who believes her first loyalty is to her chronic pain patients and she intends to fight the department of health with every resource she has

6318560 bud was far and away the best finance director i ever saw

6318589 trauma is an event thats always been in our native communities
6318590 its not something unique to this particular era or generation
6318591 understanding how people react is very very old knowledge understanding how to take care of people is very very old knowledge
6318592 were setting our children up to not have good mental health
6318593 they take a lot of risks they put themselves out there to get harmed again and again and again
6318594 we can help families by having them recognize things they can do that are therapeutic
6318595 i think people are really ready not only in the primary election but in the general election for someone who represents an independent voice i think that really carried the day
6318596 my chances to get out and about were pretty limited
6318597 you have to give him credit he worked extremely hard
6318598 senator barrasso will run a campaign focused on the issues wyoming people care about low taxes domestic energy production and a strong economy
6318599 the close result in the democratic primary shows that negative attack politics wont work in wyoming
6318600 that money that ive received from those union political action committees reflects membership money and not the narrow special interest of an industry
6318601 that money is tied to workers so i think its substantially different
6318602 im happy to have contributions from people who look at the way i legislate and the way i vote and if they support that then they can contribute
6318603 i imagine that all those pacs that have given him better than a million dollars would be surprised to hear that he doesnt listen to them
6318604 for all the talk about money wyoming is still the kind of state that you need to get out and shake voters hands and have the discussions on their doorstep
6318605 weve knocked on half the doors in the state and our goal is to knock on the other half before the general election
6318606 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
6318607 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
6318608 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
6318609 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
6318610 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
6318611 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
6318612 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
6318613 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
6318614 so we basically have the same life expectancy as somebody in africa
6318615 we understand that rising energy prices are pinching montanans and those with the lowest incomes are among the hardest hit because they typically live in homes that are the least energy efficient
6318616 i am urging electricity and natural gas suppliers to consider donating to low income weatherization and related programs
6318617 the upcoming winter season with the significant increase in the cost of energy is rapidly approaching a crisis for many of our less fortunate neighbors
6318618 by making montanans homes more energy efficient there will be a lasting impact on these families and bring them hope that they will be warm during the cold
6318619 by the time we meet our fixed costs our salaries and fuel and so forth thats about 86 percent of the total budget like i said theres not a lot of wiggle room
6318620 glacier has been the hidden gem of the national park service for a long time now its been discovered
6318621 because people do want to see the glaciers before theyre gone
6318622 we definitely havent been able to capture all our fuel costs every time we have a vacancy we review it carefully do we really need this position
6318623 we think we might be in line for funding in 2010 or 2011
6318624 you try to focus on the things that present the most hazard
6318625 beyond that theres just so much its hard for me to be specific its a notebook full a big three ringed binder
6318626 but its hard to know because prices have gone up so much in the last two years
6318627 divide six into 400 million and thats how long its going to take to fix everything that needs fixing in this park
6318628 at the end of last night we all knew there might be some ballots left in the ballot box at the mountain view polling location i thought they were absentee ballots left at the poll by absentee voters and locked into the ballot bin but not brought in
6318629 anytime you get a win with these guys youve accomplished something
6318630 this is huge for our team we have definitely been in position to win races and have just had bad breaks and luck then you start to question what you are doing as a driver and as a team for us to come out tonight and to do it on a track where there really wasnt any passing is great for this team
6318631 when i was racing donny and got by him i actually got into a guy and knocked my front nose wing off i knew i needed it to stay on there or i would be in trouble
6318632 at the end i was being very patient with a few guys i knew if i could hit my marks it would be tough for him to get around me i would have had to have made a big mistake to lose the lead i just tried to keep my car clean once i got the lead
6318633 we had a good car and we probably just pushed a little too hard
6318634 i got to a lapped car that was just about spun out and i had no choice but to about crash myself and we were lucky that we only got passed by one car
6318635 thats just racing and the way it goes weve won them that way and tonight we lost it that way
6318636 its very difficult for someone who was raised on the coasts in dense urban areas to transplant to a rural state and really have those rural values integrated fully into their psyche into their soul
6318637 i assume she might be saying the same thing about john barrasso because he is from the east coast as well
6318638 i think the race in the general election will be about urban issues versus rural issues and rural values versus urban values perhaps even more than partisan issues
6318639 thats the kind of stuff people talk about when they dont have anything positive to offer
6318640 you know what what we need to talk about is how to solve energy issues and health care issues and our economic issues the price of gas the price of groceries
6318641 but at the same time it can be somewhat offensive to people whove moved here its sort of a youre not welcome message
6318642 they are branding him gasp hide the children a new yorker
6318643 just a little bit every day however much you can manage after school
6318644 and dont look so grumpy the days are shorter and shorter
6318645 looks like youre near the center though thats pretty cool
6318646 hard to tell at this angle are they heading for us
6318647 whered they even go i mean really are they just hiding back there until we leave
6318648 this isnt hard hadyn some big birds dive bombed us they dropped these cool tubes it makes no sense its awesome totally factor 10 cool
6318649 maybe theyre some sort of carrier pigeon but do carrier pigeons even fly anymore
6318650 only on gilligans island tv land listen to me youre just guessing
6318651 obviously they are what if they need to carry these things farther still what if theyre just resting what if they are trained to do this when they need to rest drop their packages find a hole rest then grab their stuff and carry on
6318652 so are you suggesting we flush them out cause there is no way im going to crawl back there they can get out later on their own
6318653 this band looks like ivory but its hard to tell in this light
6318654 smells old yuck turn on your flashlight mine is getting weak
6318655 you have been chosen for a life of great purpose adventure awaits you in the hidden lands
6318656 looks like something from king arthur what in the world are the hidden lands
6318657 you have been chosen for a life of great purpose adventure awaits you in the hidden lands
6318658 you take two and ill take two stick them under your shirt and act cool i have no idea what these are but for now theyre our little secret
6318659 many people were understandably offended and hurt by the reported statement if i was living with hiv i know i would have been deeply concerned
6318660 why would we start introducing approaches that firstly we know dont work and secondly that go against all the things we hold dear as pacific people
6318661 theres obviously lots of work still to be done but methods such as isolation locking people up and mandatory testing dont work in preventing hiv transmission
6318662 the pacific regional strategy on hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases specifically acknowledges the cultural and religious values of pacific communities which are based on compassion and reconciliation
6318663 but a clinic or hospital is no place for shaming blaming or retribution
6318664 every health professional has to remember that not only do the people they see have a right to advice and medical treatment but that that they also have a right to be treated with respect and dignity no matter what their hiv status is
6318665 oh this is my ffirend from ny she is dating
6318666 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control
6318667 this is a giant step down a road that will potentially leave women with a major loss of access to contraceptive methods
6318668 pregnancy is not a disease to be treated by abortion and neither is fertility
6318669 to be coerced to treat it as if it were a condition that is pathological is unjust
6318670 there is an organized effort to force health care professionals to do things that violate their conscience
6318671 is not abortion or contraception but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience
6318672 an environment in the health care industry that is intolerant of certain religious beliefs ethnic and cultural traditions and moral convictions
6318673 even without hands there is nothing i cant do i can open doors with keys sew work on the computer use the cell phone cut up food cook nothing is impossible i like embroidery and beads people are surprised when they see my parents house decorated all over with my needlework
6318674 since then i pray a lot every day all the time i pray a lot and cry when young people in the church see me like that they just leave me alone and when i come out of the church laughing they know i was praying
6318675 it would be hard for me without prayer i pray every morning before i leave home later in the day i also read the daily readings and meditate i try to implement the message of each days readings it gives me much power
6318676 prayer is an important part of my life i am alone a lot so i pray all the time i make time to read the bible i am also writing a book about the church in nisekh and about faith
6318677 my faith is very important to me i could not live without my faith
6318678 i wanted to tell many people about my faith so i started with my family several people followed me my niece is now baptized my younger brother my older brothers children and my two friends come to church too
6318679 people seeing me somehow get interested in god and the church our church in nisekh is like a family i have been teaching catechism there to seven adults five women and two men
6318680 how to teach challenged children she taught me very intensively for two months and then i read many books about how to teach special children but mostly i learned from the children themselves
6318681 most of my time is taken up by this school this work is very beautiful the children are not ordinary so we cant have many in one room i now have seven students and feel ill soon need a helper they obey me very well but at first they did not know i was their teacher
6318682 during this first year i learned how to work with each student
6318683 do not bend at the knees the doctors say the way i move while walking is too stressful for my kidneys
6318684 i have not seen them for three years i have to save up 115 000 tugrug about 100 to travel there i need to see them and decide if i must bring them soon or whether it can wait a little
6318685 i want to take care of my parents and my sister who first took me to church
6318686 my parents are very happy about me because im very successful all my life they worried a lot about me parents worry about their children even if they have hands and legs but they worried even more about me because i was born without them

6318689 the enquirer knows the story is not true as they sat on a hill above my house for a week with telephoto lenses and video cameras and had no sighting of her the guest cottage she was supposedly staying in is under construction and has no floor
6318690 rielle said it was one of the happiest nights of her life
6318691 she said we touched on the subject of abortion but he wouldnt hear of it

6318704 it was distracting because it gives you a hundred other things to think about
6318705 im in very good condition but it was very difficult
6318706 it is all about equipment and i put my bag in the wrong corner and everything got wet
6318707 in these circumstances its normal that things arent so easy its nothing to worry about it was tricky a little hard to get the right distance of approach i made it and thats the most important thing
6318708 for the first time something didnt go right at all
6318709 there are lots of people coming from iraq to share their experiences with taliban its al qaeda which designs the attack and the locals afghan taliban who implement it
6318710 they were saying that they would carry out more suicide attacks and expand their activities to new areas to areas near kabul now we see that they did what they had said
6318711 they have very definitely targeted the districts and provinces around the capital
6318712 it has a much greater impact that just violence in remote or random districts it gets international headlines and increases a perception of insecurity it has an immediate impact on morale
6318713 the response needs to be not just a military one but finding out what kind of grievances are driving people to join these sorts of movements
6318714 advance of the terrorists is due in very large part to the porousness of the borders
6318715 reflects in large part a lack of sufficient forces to do the job
6318716 there are not enough intelligence assets there are not enough helicopters to provide quick reaction capability
6318717 psychologically its creating the impression among afghans that nato forces are on the defensive and that its the afghan insurgents and their allies who are winning the war
6318718 i think they have demonstrated in the past that they are going to target nato forces hoping it will create a backlash back in europe or canada that will lead to an ally pulling out much as the spanish and others pulled out in iraq
6318719 spare me please id happily use openoffice but gimp is named pretty well something youd better keep locked in your cellar and not let out when nice folk came to visit

6318735 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6318736 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as pullovers and jackets made of cashmere wool

6318747 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards

6318749 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law

6318754 mike has evolved into one of the bright young pitching stars in the national league
6318755 theres no question about it and i think hell continue to mature and develop with each outing hes been very impressive from where he came early in the season where we were questioning whether or not to have him on the staff whether or not to keep him in the rotation and hes pretty much been a huge part of the success that weve had here
6318756 in general the people who will be able to accomplish the most will be those who can win rather than fight their way one need not be a communist but one should be capable of an open mind and a closed mouth no one of the dreamy parlor socialist type should be considered sensation hunters equally undesirable
6318757 the quakers saved us if it werent for them we simply would have died
6318758 they must have been brave people they came to a frigid country they didnt know and immediately cared for everyone including children with typhus and who knows what other diseases

6318764 for the past two weeks we tried to ignore the pressure to defend our gold medal but the world has gotten so much better we played them on their home field advantage and we stepped up and we won and it was beautiful
6318765 weve played in the rain before and its just something that were able to do unless theres lightning
6318766 its fun and thats what makes our game so enjoyable you can play no matter what the conditions are i think its harder being a fan sitting in the rain than being a player
6318767 its just another reason why we play in bathing suits
6318768 i hope we keep going i feel like we have unfinished business
6318769 we knew all year it might come down to us and a chinese final and thats what you want to see

6318807 solving this problem will require a difficult diplomatic feat convincing pakistans government to undermine the sanctuary on its soil if we look at the growing list of terrorist attacks and foiled plots in north america and western europe it is evident that plots stemming from the afghanistan pakistan border region are the single most important threat to western security

6318809 we have always known that this part of the world is very rich in prehistoric remains
6318810 but the sheer number of new finds exposed by the fire is the most exciting development in archaeology in my experience
6318811 one of the very rare features exposed by the removal of the entire plant and soil covering is a set of defined borders to the areas cultivated in the bronze age
6318812 but it gave us access to a landscape which we could never have reached otherwise on such a scale no archaeologist has the means to dig out an area like this what we have found as a result has altered perceptions of the period it also raises questions about the scale of what else lies hidden over the rest of the north york moors
6318813 weve brought things almost up to date by making detailed surveys of slit trenches and foxholes used for training on fylingdales in the second world war and since forgotten
6318814 and the most recent finds are shell craters left over from artillery practice which carried on into the 1950s

6318835 in addition the revised guidelines provide greater flexibilities for reit managers to manage their reits portfolio mix
6318836 for example reit managers will have more freedom to invest in foreign real estates it also allows a portion of a reits portfolio to consist of real estates that it does not wholly own or have a majority ownership
6318837 the guidelines were also revised to allow reit managers to seek a general mandate from unit holders for issuance of units up to 20 per cent of its fund size
6318838 previously the issuance of any number of new units required reit managers to hold meetings to seek unit holders specific approval
6318839 in all other circumstances the sc will conduct a post review of the valuations to ensure that they are reasonable and well supported
6318840 this is reflected in the new requirement directing reit managers to appoint a designated person responsible for compliance
6318841 this ensures securities laws land laws guidelines and rules are complied with at all times and also streamline similar requirement between reit managers and all other capital market intermediaries
6318842 these specify who can act as principal advisers for the submission of corporate proposals to the sc in addition to the required competency standards for principal advisers when dealing with corporate proposals involving initial public offers of reits on bursa malaysia

6318930 i use google bookmarks daily and although it is not a social media service yet since you do not share your links it gets the job done for basic bookmarking
6318931 i have accounts for both lively and second life but never use them they would just take up too much of the little time i have and one has to set the limits somewhere

6318950 weve found the volume of transactions has dropped significantly probably by half and where there are interested buyers theyre really struggling to get finance
6318951 this time last year this would have gone within hours now its been on the market a month and theres very little interest
6318952 theyre already asking 25 000 less than they would have done last year but still no takers
6318953 we are confident that our business having been well restructured is in a strong position to move forward when the market improves
6318954 this comes against the background of the uks biggest mortgage lender halifax telling us that the value of our homes has slumped by more than 10 over the last year
6318955 the problem is that lads mags are not offering anything different to what you can get online
6318956 why would you pay for a magazine when you can access exactly the same sort of information constantly refreshed for free
6318957 when magazines like loaded and fhm were at their peak there werent any online offerings at all
6318958 they were also far more diverse in their content right now theyre all cut from the same cloth theyre run of the mill plastic big breasted and fake
6318959 i really think its the same old stuff again and again every week theyre totally utterly predictable and stale
6318960 there was a real momentum around the readership of heat as there was with the mens mags in my era but i think things just moved on
6318961 readers grow out of magazines you buy a magazine at a certain time of your life youll have a particular favourite for four or five years and then you move on and those readers arent necessarily replaced as other media might have emerged that they want to read instead
6318962 when heat started there werent any gossip websites and mail outs like popbitch and holy moly and you couldnt read american gossip as readily as you can now
6318963 and hes got really strong opinions about the mens market
6318964 for example when theyre on a train journey theyve got an ipod they might have a psp they might watch a film on a laptop or on their iphone theyve got so much more to do than just read a magazine thats why the market is in trouble
6318965 the novelty has worn off people have seen it all before titles like maxim are quite an old genre of magazine now i think they need to reassess and look at what young british blokes are into today
6318966 what were doing with front is to try to offer something new and weve gone for an alternative rockier sort of emo audience you cant see nuts and zoo appealing to them the big publishing companies have been a bit slow to react to the changing interests of 20 year olds
6318967 journalists are always so negative about lads magazines reporting their demise with glee but they still sell a lot of copies and the brands themselves are quite strong
6318968 a lot of newspapers have been saying that lads have gone off lager looking at girls and

6318981 i wouldnt really call it a mean streak its an aggressive game
6318982 its a mans game and you cant come out here and try to lollygag through practice
6318983 these are professional out here and theyre trying to embarrass you on every play just like im trying to embarrass them thats what people look at when they look at film i want to be known as a finisher and somebody that they can depend on
6318984 hes a tough tough guy and you can probably tell that by looking at him but sometimes with mcchesney youve got to tell him to slow down a little bit because hes a hammer and everything looks like a nail and sometimes you cant do that
6318985 he likes to blow everybody up thats a good mentality on the defensive side on the offensive side youve got to be slower a little luther vandross not all ac dc

6318987 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6318988 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6318989 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6318990 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6318991 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6318992 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6318993 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6318994 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better

6318999 urban indian spending has risen by 35 per cent in the past two three years which is spent on entertainment and personal grooming given these trends it was imperative for reebok to provide greater choice to the consumer in the lifestyle space reebok classics is a sport and style fusion wear alternative terms to describe it could be sports fashion or sports inspired style
6319000 nowadays people wear sports products not just to the gym but also when they go out also consumers in india are extremely style conscious and like to stay abreast of international trends

6319002 i think weve had pretty good success but weve been recruiting for a year now and were still short
6319003 its tough to find math science teachers right now in the state
6319004 we struggled a little bit to find a science teacher and a math teacher at the high school
6319005 at this point we do not have any additional stipends but we are looking into them as a possibility for next year
6319006 we just rely on pine trees reputation to draw them in
6319007 in hallsville were in a significant period of growth in our student population so we have to closely monitor enrollment in order to make accurate staffing decisions
6319008 we continue to be successful in finding highly qualified teachers to fill all of our positions for us the difficulty is not as much filling positions as it is meeting the demands of growth and at the same time being responsible to our taxpayers and not overstaffing
6319009 we dont usually have a turnover but due to families moving new personnel changing careers and retirements it all added up
6319010 were fully staffed certified and ready for the new school year
6319011 some went to districts closer to their homes because of the gasoline it was just to expensive to drive then there were some we lost to retirement some moved with their husbands
6319012 the toughest areas to fill are science math and foreign languages
6319013 we were fortunate this year that we didnt have any openings in foreign language or math we did in science and those areas were very difficult to fill

6319097 i think the software industry is due for reform weve been waging this campaign for years to see people like peoplesoft copying our methods in the end is very good for customers i would encourage other software vendors to do it as well it allows customers to really understand whats working and whats not working whats vaporware and whats reality

6319248 in each case the children fell through the access cover of the rainwater tank and drowned within minutes
6319249 young children are insatiably curious and enjoy exploring their environment their lack of appreciation of any danger compounded by their inability to swim and their failure to call out for help can be a recipe for disaster
6319250 as rainwater tanks are now becoming more common the risk of accidents involving children will inevitably increase it is crucial that we highlight the potential dangers for young children and ensure the tanks are properly secured
6319251 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6319252 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6319253 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6319254 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6319255 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6319256 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6319257 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6319258 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6319259 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6319260 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6319261 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6319262 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6319263 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6319264 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6319265 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6319266 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6319267 we are willing for a proper discussion attended by the tamil nadu chief minister and the prime minister without preconditions we are agreeable to any proper decision that may result after the tripartite discussions because we believe in national integration
6319268 individual comfort scores over greater good like fuel conservation and climate change
6319269 bangaloreans hardly pay attention to fuel conservation and do not care about environment
6319270 we have adopted a method covering a cross section of the population from various zones of the city to give a fair idea about the general habit of car owners in bangalore
6319271 we need to think of methods to conserve fuel the city is not doing too well on most indicators of the fuel conservation
6319272 a drastic overhaul of our public transport system and a major change in the citizens perception is the need of the hour to make fuel conservation a reality
6319273 this year however the lush green cover the worms and small fish proliferating in the wetlands in ghana will definitely attract more birds
6319274 what will i look forward to my hut is still floating in the water and most of my belongings are lost things like my tv which i bought after putting together my savings are all gone
6319275 last week some people told us that the incessant rains had created a flood like situation in some places in delhi by the next morning we woke up to knee deep water in our houses as the police asked us to evacuate we had to leave behind most of our things including our cattle
6319276 life in this tent is terrible there is not enough food being distributed not enough beds but i am scared to even think what will happen once we have to go back to fending our own way how am i going to support my family
6319277 the water has started drying but i am worried because my child has fallen ill he has been running high fever since yesterday
6319278 as it is we are in such a bad situation with half our belongings gone and then these illnesses but what to do
6319279 the danger level of the water of the yamuna river is 204 83 metres and while the water right now is still above that level things are beginning to look positive after mondays 205 71 wednesday saw the level dip to 205 61 metres the level is receding
6319280 these floods are an indicator to the government to look back at its plans today real estate seems to be controlling everything the uncontrolled growth of buildings and various constructions of the yamuna rivers flood plains is the cause of such disasters
6319281 constructions on the floodplains depletes it of its water recharge capacity if you look at the commonwealth village obviously they have plans of stopping the water from entering it if flood like situation happens that would divert the water towards the other low lying areas and submerge them
6319282 people losing their lives their livelihood is a sad situation but this is the rivers way of expressing that it has the right over its floodplains
6319283 monday night there was a big lightning storm as everybody knows in the valley and a couple of lcsc physical plant employees decided to check the buildings out because in the past there have been problems during a lightning storm
6319284 they noticed smoke coming from this building so they came inside the story goes that they opened a vent up somewhere and a big bellow of smoke came out and they immediately called the fire department and by the time the fire department got here there were actually visible flames so the fire department got into the walls and into the ceiling and put the fire out quickly
6319285 it wasnt a very big fire but it did enough damage to three suites to be closed for right now
6319286 the building is closed until everything gets okd and inspectors come through and can check it out
6319287 we actually had three students in the complex at the time of the fire but none of them were in the rooms affected
6319288 they were all on the bottom floor and they didnt lose anything none of their stuff was damaged
6319289 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6319290 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6319291 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6319292 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6319293 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6319294 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6319295 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6319296 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6319297 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6319298 nur weil ich ein bisserl aufm pfig und frech bin heisst das noch lange nicht dass ich nicht richtig ticke

6319300 seit dem letzten ball in athen wollten wir unseren titel verteidigen wir f hlten uns wie krieger da drau en im regen es ist eine ehre das erste paar zu sein dass bei olympia zwei goldmedaillen im beach volleyball gewinnt
6319301 ohne das publikum h tten wir es nie ins finale geschafft
6319302 jeder hat seinen pers nlichen arbeits und wahlkampfstil man muss das hinnehmen wie es ist und versuchen daraus das optimum zu machen
6319303 wir machen in wien ohnedies mehr als alle anderen bundesl nder
6319304 die steirische vp wird sich mit einigen kleineren veranstaltungen am wahlkampf beteiligen einen beitrag zum wahlkampfbudget gibt es nicht er war auch nie gefordert
6319305 wir haben unsere verpflichtungen bisher immer erf llt das ndert sich nicht
6319306 die vp burgenland war immer eine loyale organisation zur bundespartei und wir werden auch diesmal unseren beitrag leisten
6319307 da wir aber gerade eine landtagswahl gehabt haben stellt es nat rlich eine herausforderung f r uns dar
6319308 the secret is we really like each other we have no choice you may have had a run in with someone in a wnba season it doesnt matter at this point its a sisterhood thats what its all about
6319309 this team has the best chemistry of any olympic team ive been on
6319310 and i worried about that because we only had a few days together
6319311 we put that behind us once we wear red white and blue
6319312 we have the most national championships out of the group so we dont bring it up
6319313 doesnt count when theres only four teams in the league
6319314 we have no choice you may have had a run in with someone in a wnba season it doesnt matter at this point its a sisterhood thats what its all about
6319315 were a band of sisters fighting for our country you have to have some type of passion about it for yourself and for each other every minute youre out on the court its not that were doing it for me were doing it for we and when you do it that way things work out
6319316 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6319317 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6319318 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6319319 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6319320 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6319321 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6319322 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6319323 who are open to doing something on the production side
6319324 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6319325 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6319326 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6319327 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6319328 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6319329 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6319330 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6319331 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6319332 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6319333 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6319334 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6319335 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6319336 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6319337 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6319338 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6319339 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6319340 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6319341 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6319342 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6319343 denn immer mehr menschen achten auf eine verantwortungsbewusste ern hrung und auf qualit t bei der herstellung von lebensmitteln und genau darum geht es ja auch bei slow food
6319344 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6319345 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6319346 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6319347 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6319348 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6319349 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6319350 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6319351 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6319352 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6319353 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6319354 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6319355 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6319356 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6319357 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6319358 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6319359 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6319360 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6319361 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6319362 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6319363 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6319364 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6319365 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6319371 the first half was very good we got to grips with the game in the first 15 minutes but i really thought that the 30 minutes before half time was very good we played some good football and held control of the ball very well
6319372 but i think the conditions in the second half completely ruined the game we were in control of the game and could have scored a couple more
6319373 unfortunately we dont want to concede any goals to any team well remember the first half and try to completely forget the second half looking at the team today it should stand us in good stead for the next few weeks
6319374 with the players we have were capable of playing like that next month its the way the players want to play if we can play like that in the next two games were capable of getting something out of them

6319388 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6319389 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6319390 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6319630 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6319631 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6319632 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6319633 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6319634 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it
6319635 every day truck drivers gamble with death or serious injury when they go over level crossings with badly placed stop signs and inadequate sighting distances he said

6319653 we know that greater manchester is home to thousands of football fans so as the new football season kicks off we are urging anyone whos tuning in live to watch their team to make sure they have a valid tv licence
6319654 we netted more than 1 380 evaders across greater manchester during the three weeks of euro 2008 so we are urging people not to risk getting caught out yet again
6319655 tv licensing would always rather people get a licence than risk prosecution which is why we are making sure that everyone is aware of the need to be covered

6319663 i had to leave him because i had to take my daughter to school we got to school and my daughter always phoned him he said have a lovely day and she said okay see you later
6319664 i noticed the doors to the stable were slightly ajar i just ran to the stables normally it would be locked
6319665 we felt that he was a low risk because he didnt have concrete plans and because he said his wife and daughter were a preventive factor
6319666 he became very agitated and worried and was clearly under a lot of stress
6319667 ive heard that he was acutely stressed with pressures relating to his work and had initially sought to get help
6319668 it was clear from the statement from his gp that there were very real concerns about his well being and it was clear also that he had considered the possibility of taking his own life although he had assured mental health professionals that he wouldnt take that step
6319669 his widow told us that as the days went by he became increasingly more anxious as he went about his day to day activities prior to april 18

6319674 he was very upset as well as being quite badly gashed by the bolt we got there and his chest was seeping with blood it was pretty bad he was really hurt and upset
6319675 i told them what had happened and they said they would investigate but the bolts are still there

6319687 he didnt force me he said if you want to do it you can take my zanjeer
6319688 there was no way you were a victim of what was going on in the mosque where you
6319689 the truth is as long as you could get hold of a zanjeer you were happy and wanted to do it
6319690 i did want to use it at the end because i heard somebody say this is the last session and after this the matam is going to finish
6319691 but under 16 wasnt allowed that is how he did wrong i wanted to do it but he shouldnt have given me the zanjeer thats the main thing
6319692 for a young aged boy to do it with an adult zanjeer it is very harmful

6319725 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
6319726 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
6319727 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
6319728 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
6319729 massage is helpful in the short term but the alexander technique retained effectiveness at one year the results should apply to most patients with chronic or recurrent back pain
6319730 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions

6319732 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term

6319752 a crime against humanity jeopardising the peace processes in burundi and dr congo
6319753 ive heard a rumor that youre going to pick a pro life vp is that true
6319754 life applies to those that are not born as well as those that are born
6319755 in the past youve alienated a great deal of conservatives who believe that conservative principles are always the answer by stepping across the aisle
6319756 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can actually rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone who will cause us to want to stay home perhaps
6319757 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6319758 were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you therell be another one of these firestorms
6319759 any choice he makes for vice president will have pros and cons
6319760 not as far as i can tell a one issue party that would be just one issue among many that would have to be evaluated by the party
6319761 the poor conditions on the farms and the need for reforms
6319762 workers are finally getting some protection we need all the support we can get for farm workers
6319763 now we are hoping we will get our pay on time we hope now we will finally get clean water the water now isnt even good enough to take showers some of us are getting sick weve never had decent water
6319764 the bad treatment by the boss we have been under a lot of pressure for example we dont have adequate housing and the water situation is bad the water is contaminated and people are getting sick the boss said he didnt have time to fix it people were getting sick
6319765 i always tell the workers dont let people treat you like you dont count
6319766 these workers were brought in later than many were this year
6319767 and expect to keep working until mid december we hope to have a contract negotiated and adopted before the end of this season
6319768 so now we will work to secure a first contract that delivers that
6319769 this marks a new era for workers and unionism in canada
6319770 we helped process over 22 million in parental benefit claims for sawp workers recently
6319771 our migrant worker centres helped over 30 000 workers last year
6319772 we dont think we have the right kind of tools to help decision makers plan for the future
6319773 please move to the centre of the carriage she doesnt mean to centre yourself in front of the doors and the mysterious location of turning signals in your car try one of the levers on the steering column
6319774 i thought it was possible to beat her as long as i was full of confidence because shes a defensive player
6319775 physically playing singles is not as easy as playing teams where its just one match a day but you dont have a choice you just have to adjust fast
6319776 we often play korean athletes in major competitions so we are aware of their strengths in chops i was prepared for a difficult match perhaps even to the seventh game
6319777 i wanted to hurry up and win so i could go back and get some rest
6319778 so i wasnt taking control of some opportunities and i was playing a bit rushed
6319779 in principle yes i must repeat we will never be perfect
6319780 it could be i should have pushed it more at the very beginning
6319781 its not up to me to impose a solution however the technical committees will get clear orders to find a solution
6319782 the b panel scoring is where theyre not getting that separation theyve got to find way to separate them
6319783 the new system is certainly not perfect yet but were on a good way taking us to a very positive solution
6319784 the first thing we will closely have to look at is to make some corrections in the balance between difficulty and execution at this time were trending a little bit too much toward the difficulty
6319785 they need to get judges to judge the b panel the way its written in the code i dont know how youre ever going to get them to do it
6319786 again im not saying the results are wrong thats the part of the system theyve got to find a way to let judges judge and not let them be worried about whether theyre in the average or not
6319787 surely everybody can make mistakes this is human but it is not allowed to be biased and make mistakes intentionally
6319788 i think theres room for improvement still and always will be that human element that theyre trying to legislate out of gymnastics will always be there when you have that you have the opportunity for mistakes you have the opportunity for incompetence
6319789 you certainly can find things that raise a red flag
6319790 but at the end of the day did the right people get the right medals i think they did
6319791 they are more experienced and stronger but we have made great strides for these olympic games this is the best that we could do
6319792 the chinese federation works very hard and they come out with a good game plan every time
6319793 they will continue to get better because they work so hard at it
6319794 these girls motivate us more than i can even tell you because they are so good
6319795 coming in we knew it would come down to us and china
6319796 its what you want to see the chinese women are getting better and better we knew china would be going for it in these olympics
6319797 we have absorbed a lot of valuable experience such as how to attack and defend against good teams how to solve problems we encounter on the court and how to adjust our strategy and calm down
6319798 these medals are very significant for china for the people for the federation and for the players
6319799 investments in energy projects will total 16 trillion in the next two decades that investment along with spending for long lived buildings transportation manufacturing and public works could lock us into climate chaos or it could set us on the path toward a sustainable future how can we make sure that this new infrastructure is climate friendly for starters it will have to be both highly efficient and powered by renewable energy the sun wind earth or ocean a combination of the right policies and the right technologies can get us there
6319800 there is no energy crisis only a crisis of ignorance
6319801 i am very grateful to be joining these great p ost modern poets at tomkins park for this festival and to be given the opportunity to express the gratitude and love i feel for the late allen ginsberg who was very kind to me while he was living also to be able to express my love for the downtown art community that is close to my heart and has been a big part of my life howl is one of the greatest poems of our time and i am very happy to celebrate that and the life of allen ginsberg with a very alive downtown new york art scene
6319802 you know theyre going to drill oil up in alaska
6319803 well its only inevitable society believes it can refine shale of all fucking things to oil that it will somehow benefit us i find this hard to believe given the difficulty of refining shale to burnable oil it takes about as much energy to refine it from shale when compared to the refined yields the energy gain is basically zero if anything it is a waste of energy to try and refine something that will only yield about 20 of what is refined
6319804 we have built a chemical dependence upon hydrocarbons that when burned up release co2 and co into the atmosphere
6319805 it doesnt take bill nye the science guy to figure that shit out
6319806 youre not kidding besides hydrogen fuel cells or solar power to me seem pretty feasable
6319807 most people dont warm up to nucelar energy but honestly its pretty damn safe and might be the only saving grace we have while entering the energy crisis
6319808 but there is an energy crisis if energy can neither be created nor destroyed then energy is constantly being used most things that use energy in a mechanical manner emit thermal energy into the surrounding atmosphere
6319809 and even if you stopped cars youd have to regulate factories and warehouses it would be one hellish overhaul but ultimately it would be worth it
6319810 well if your house was on fire and you started breathing in smoke youd try to get out right
6319811 house fires wouldnt start if you didnt have the house to begin with didnt they teach you anything in grade school
6319812 well then you also must understand that in order to propigate life and to advance it then resource partitioning becomes a problem due to overpopulation and further strain on the ecosystem
6319813 how many people is it going to take to get to the end of the food supply
6319814 or the end of the mayan calender or the end of terrence mckennas timewave zero graph all of which oddly enough end on december 21 2012 if you look this shit up on google beware that most of the sites are fanatics and zealots that rejoice in the simple minded destruction of this sphere all of which deserve hollowpoints to the skull region

6319940 were not hawking viagra so dont worry our email campaigns arent that bad but we also affirm the use of double opt in email lists to assure that customers who are truly interested in our national media marketing products get the right emails
6319941 i truly believe that our customers not regulatory agencies are the best source of national media marketing marketing feedback face it if were not making money and our customers are pissed off our marketing methods are wrong and not productive dont forget that private companies are in the business to make cash and dont make a profit banging their heads against the walls
6319942 i really believe that my employers are genuine and care about what they do they are not out to prey on people or report false numbers they just want to make money and provide for the welfare of their company just like anyone else
6319943 do you as business leaders and executives make sure that your books are 100 accurate and sound or do you leave this task to your respective accounting agencies
6319944 i see to it that all our data is accurate
6319945 but i trust our finance department to crunch the numbers correctly and report accurately at the end of the day it is my job to move the business forward not be a slave to my calculator and exel spreadsheets
6319946 i personally believe national media marketing marketing practices of today that are thought of as inappropriate will be the future of tomorrows national media marketing industry leaders
6319947 we need to stick to our guns and abide by best practice methods in order to preserve the integrity of the national media marketing industry as a whole if we degrade ourselves by using cheap marketing practices to make a quick buck we will only be hurting ourselves in the long run
6319948 everyone in this national media marketing sector knows how to blast out email notices fliers etc to people but not everyone knows how to do this in an efficient manner that creates profit margin efficieny in our industry is absolutely key
6319949 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games

6319978 candidate shortages are still very evident in many sectors and in these cases todays job seekers need to be prepared for a swift response
6319979 solid candidates in skills short areas often receive an employment offer within 48 hours of an interview although it is not uncommon for candidates with a very strong skill base and experience ideally suited to a vacancy to be offered a role less than 24 hours after interview
6319980 traditionally a week would easily pass between an interview and an offer
6319981 it is no surprise that organisations with an efficient recruitment process are the winners in the current market
6319982 weve even seen instances where some hiring managers will conduct interviews on a friday and then come into work on a saturday or sunday to finalise the offer so it is presented to the ideal candidate first thing monday morning many businesses are also acting to secure quality candidates before formal vacancies are even confirmed
6319983 candidates should be ready to receive and action offers quickly and be sure of their motivations for applying for specific jobs they should also be prepared for a number of offers and the concerted efforts of their existing employers to buy them back through a counter offer
